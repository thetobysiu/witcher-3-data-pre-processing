Geralt|From the look of things, pretty soon Ciri won't need your help anymore.
Avallach|Nor yours.
Geralt|True. She'll do whatever she wants - and I'll support her. What about you? Ready to let her live her own life?
Avallach|I shan't force her to do anything, if that's your question.
Geralt|Charming world you Aen Elle have got. Could easily fall in love with the place.
Geralt|Tell me, how do you do it? Sit around playing flute, painting rutting unicorns in gorgeous landscapes, building ornately sculpted towers…
Geralt|And then you murder us, without batting an eye, without a hint of guilt. How?
Avallach|Do you humans feel guilt when you murder Aen Seidhe elves? Or dwarves? Or dryads?
Avallach|We are the same… simply because we both firmly believe others are inferior.
Geralt|Probably accuse me of being a typically primitive human - but why don't we just kill Ge'els?
Avallach|Because we would gain nothing in the short term… and we might not live to see the long term.
Avallach|With Ge'els, it is not what he does on the battlefield, but beyond it. He manipulates, lies, keeps the Aen Elle in check.
Avallach|Remove that pawn from the board, and you won't change the outcome of the match. Keep it there, and you could use it to change the rules.
Geralt|Still haven't explained why we need to mess around with this subterfuge instead of just killing Ge'els.
Geralt|Tell me something more about Caranthir. Know him well?
Avallach|Know him? I reared him.
Geralt|Raised, don't you mean?
Avallach|No, Geralt. I began shaping him long before he was born.
Avallach|For centuries I… brought together pairs of elves manifesting certain abilities - those able to manipulate time and space. He is the result of these efforts. Caranthir, a golden child.
Avallach|Golden child who grew up to be a criminal.
Geralt|You imprisoned Ciri the first time you met her. Now you protect her while fighting against your own kind. Quite an about-face.
Avallach|First of all, I did not imprison her. She found me. It was her destiny.
Geralt|Yeah, sure. Get to the "second of all." Why're you helping her?
Avallach|Because she is a danger. A mortal one.
Avallach|You look at her and see a human, a ward, a daughter, even. I look and see the Elder Blood - a power that can destroy the world, a power that must be kept from Eredin's power-addled hands at all costs.
Avallach|Admittedly, our motives differ. Yet in spite of that we share a goal. So you would be wise to trust me… or at least try.
Geralt|So long.
Avallach|Find Zireael… Time is dwindling…
Avallach|Yes, Geralt?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|So long.
Geralt|Gave Tamara your gift.
Baron|How'd she react?
Geralt|Probably not like you'd have wanted. She threw the doll away.
Baron|Threw it away? Oh gods, I'd hoped, despite all… Argh…
Baron|Ahh… What of Anna?
Geralt|Still don't know anything specific, but I'm on her trail.
Baron|Well, will you stand there like a knob? Find her!
Geralt|I found her.
Baron|Ploughin' hell, why'd you not say so forthwith? Where is she?! Why have you not returned with her?
Geralt|She's in Crookback Bog. Got food, a place to live, and keeps herself busy. Didn't look like she had the slightest desire to leave.
Baron|You were to bring her back, not report on the conditions she lives under!
Geralt|I was supposed to find her. And I did. That was our deal, nothing more.
Baron|You still think me rotten to the core, a base bastard, don't you? You believe I alone am at fault for what happened here.
Geralt|Actually, that's exactly what I think.
Baron|The world might seem black and white to you witchers, but for us common folk it's shades of gray. As is my family's story.
Geralt|Sorry, but - your life story? Just not interested. This isn't a social call. I'm here on business.
Baron|Will you at least tell me how Anna wound up in that blasted bog?
Geralt|She made a pact with the Crones and… well, I think she might've lost her mind.
Baron|A pact? What the bloody hell?
Geralt|She was with child, a child she didn't want to bear. Went to the Crones for help. They promised to rid her of the problem in exchange for a year of her service. And they kept their word, in their own twisted way.
Baron|What do you mean?
Geralt|Anna must've thought the child inside her would somehow disappear. Instead the Crones sapped her of strength, and ultimately forced her body to miscarry. I think that's when she started to lose her mind.
Geralt|Then they placed magic tethers on her, tethers that cause great pain when tested. A guarantee she'll pay off her debt.
Baron|A pact with witches… Bloody nightmare, sounds like some jest! We must get her out! We can't leave her there!
Geralt|Do what you will, but leave me out of this. You ask me? Wading through the swamp to mess with the Crones - just plain stupid.
Baron|What would you have me do?! Sit on my arse and wait for her return? I'll send men, go with them myself, and we will pull her out!
Geralt|I've warned you. What you do - that's your business.
Geralt|Venturing into the swamp, even with armed men, is just a bad idea. It's a dangerous place, inherently. And I think those Crones are a greater threat than anyone realizes.
Baron|I'll not sit on my arse waiting for them to return her! Would you wait, count on their mercy if they had your daughter?
Geralt|Probably not. But I'm a witcher.
Baron|And I'm a husband and a father who's fucked up his life and the lives of his loved ones. I'll gather my men, go there and retrieve Anna!
Geralt|They fled by night. They were riding past the forest when a beast serving the Crones attacked them and abducted Anna.
Baron|A beast? Bloody hell… And Tamara - was she hurt?
Geralt|No.
Baron|Ah, thank the gods for that. So, Annie - what happened to her?
Geralt|The creature carried her deep into Crookback Bog. Didn't harm her, though. In fact, Anna seems content there.
Baron|Content? What is this tripe, witcher? What in bloody blazes is she doing in that swamp?
Geralt|Your wife is with the Crones, as their servant.
Baron|What the fuck do you mean? What Crones?
Geralt|Ones who live in Crookback Bog.
Baron|Oh, I've heard folk speak of them, but thought it naught but tales to scare the children with.
Baron|How on earth did she land there?!
Baron|And she's a servant to these Crones? What the devil does that mean?
Geralt|Probably gonna say you're not the only one to blame. All right, then. I'm willing to hear your side of the story.
Baron|With Annie… it was love at first sight. A spear tore through my shoulder at the Battle of Anchor, she tended to my wound. Once I'd recovered, I asked her to marry me. She wept with joy.
Baron|Soon after, Tamara was born, and after that they sent me to Cidaris. A warlord had risen against King Ethain, and Foltest sent help.
Baron|It was one battle to the next, one conflict after another… 'Twas a life of war, I was seldom home, and I found comfort in drink. Grew so fond of hooch I couldn't part with it when I did get home.
Geralt|All right. What then?
Baron|I went from front to front, battle to battle, collecting soldiers' coin, while Anna sat alone with the babe for months. Later I learned she'd not been so alone after all. For nearly three years she'd found comfort in the arms of one Evan, a childhood friend. A dog's bunghole.
Baron|Understand, dammit? One tussle in the hay I'd 'ave waved aside, put it out of my mind, but the woman cuckolded me for years! Without a whisker of concern for me, for my love!
Geralt|How'd you find out?
Baron|Came home one day and Anna was gone, her things, too. Found a letter. She wrote that she didn't love me, that she'd left me for that knoblicker and taken Tamara with her.
Baron|Felt like I'd been rammed in the arse by a horse. I went to find the bugger, to get the girls back, bring them home. Yet soon as I saw him, something turned inside me, something dark. I slaughtered the shit-eating twat and fed his carcass to the dogs.
Geralt|Imagine Anna wasn't exactly pleased…
Baron|Hah! Bloody understatement, if I've ever heard one! She flew into a fit, hysteria, threw herself at me, kickin' and clawin'. Finally grabbed a knife. It would've been the end of me if I'd not leapt aside.
Baron|It was the first time I hit her. I had to calm her. Felt I had no other means.
Baron|Things changed, they would never be the same. Anna tried to take her own life - and mine - several times. She would prod me, goad me, taunt me - in the hope I would hit her again, perhaps? She'd scream that I'd robbed her life of love, that I'd destroyed the idea for her and so might as well kill her.
Baron|How many times I apologized, how many armfuls of blooms and gifts I brought… She cared not a bit. Two years of her anger had turned to indifference, broken at times by her bouts of hysteria and my bouts of drunkenness.
Baron|Cannot fathom how we survived those years, but we did. Though as you know now, not everything was as it might have seemed.
Geralt|You're right - fault's on both sides, yours and hers.
Baron|I'm content that you finally see that.
Baron|Very well, then - if you won't bring Anna home, you might at least tell me how she landed in that blasted swamp.
Geralt|Got only yourself to blame, I think. Leaving her to fend for herself…
Baron|How was I not to? I was a soldier! I had no choice.
Geralt|There's always a choice.
Baron|Argh, sod it all. I see all my prattling's for naught. You won't bring Anna home, I know that. Will you betray to me how she landed in that bloody swamp?
Geralt|Don't know why you're telling me all this. Your relationship with your wife? Your concern, not mine.
Baron|Argh, a witcher. Should've expected as much.
Geralt|Guess they call you the Bloody Baron for a reason after all…
Baron|What?
Geralt|Your nickname. Makes sense now.
Baron|No, no, that's an entirely different story.
Geralt|Still seems like your fault to me.
Baron|Will you let me finish?
Geralt|Doesn't matter what I believe.
Baron|Yet looking at you I see contempt. Can't speak for the world you witchers inhabit, but in ours, nothing is ever black and white.
Geralt|Your wife can decide her own fate. I would've had to bring her back by force. Wouldn't want that, would you?
Geralt|We'll talk about her, don't worry. But I need to ask you something first.
Geralt|Got news of your wife.
Geralt|Can't help wondering why you made a deal. With the Nilfgaardians?
Baron|What could I do? Cast myself at them and die a hero? Fuck a hero's death. Fuck death.
Geralt|Rather live as a traitor?
Baron|Ere long none will remember it. Temeria is no more, there's naught left to betray.
Geralt|The local Nilfgaardian garrison - doesn't look that strong.
Baron|What of it? Even were I to attack, cut 'em down to a man, others will come soon. Black Ones will flood this land, take control before long. Sure as we've all got arseholes, they will.
Geralt|How'd you wind up here? Just curious.
Baron|It's no secret. I was a Temerian soldier - my unit smashed at the war's start. Soon after, we'd lost hope of regrouping, drivin' the foe back.
Baron|Those who remained wandered north. Others, deserters or merely broken men, joined us. We were a snowball rollin' down a slope. By the time we reached Crow's Perch, I commanded a sizeable force.
Geralt|Just march into the fortress, make yourselves at home?
Baron|With Nilfgaard advancin', the local lord had fled, abandoned the Perch. Once this war's over and Nilfgaard's victorious, the Black Ones will grant me a title. All talk of a self-proclaimed baron will cease.
Geralt|Heard anything about there being witches in Velen?
Baron|I pay no heed to peasant babblin'.
Baron|Common folk see witches, wizardry, devils and who knows what the fuck else every which way they turn.
Geralt|Your daughter's in Oxenfurt.
Baron|What the blazes…?! She all right? In good health? Safe? Why haven't you brought her back?!
Geralt|Never offered to do that.
Baron|How do you know she's safe? You see her at least?
Geralt|No, but I talked to the man who helped her escape, and then took her in.
Geralt|Tamara is safe and sound. From what I gathered, she has no desire to see you again, no intention to return.
Baron|I shan't trust some peasant dolt. I shan't trust whoever it is helped her! I need to know for certain she's safe!
Baron|Go to her. You must be sure, see her yourself. I shan't believe anyone else.
Geralt|That much I can do.
Baron|I'm grateful. Take this - call it enticement. And this might prove useful.
Geralt|What is it?
Baron|A letter of safe conduct. Ever since the Redanians took hold of the Pontar Delta, they've made it damned hard to get to Novigrad without one.
Baron|Very well, you were to find them both. What of Anna? Learned anything?
Geralt|Nothing yet. But I'm on her trail.
Baron|Well, what're you waitin' for?
Geralt|For you to tell me about Ciri. Like we agreed.
Baron|Huh, fine. A word once given…
Baron|When Ciri was on the mend, we took her out on a hunt. Thought a bit o' gallopin' would warm up her limbs gone stiff from so much bed rest.
Geralt|We'll talk about her, don't worry. But right now, you'll tell me about Ciri. Just like we agreed.
Geralt|I've done my part. You've got dozens of men - there's gotta be someone you can send.
Baron|You refuse to go?
Geralt|Mhm.
Baron|Fuck you.
Baron|Yet, if you're ever in the area, by chance, even… take this. And just make sure she's all right.
Geralt|What is it?
Baron|A letter of safe conduct. Ever since the Redanians took hold of the Pontar Delta, they've made it damned hard to get to Novigrad without one.
Geralt|I saw her, we talked. She said I could tell you she's safe…
Baron|When will she come home?
Geralt|And that she's not coming back.
Baron|She's not to return? But… I've prepared all for her, her rooms await. I sent away for new pantobles from Toussaint. How can she not come back?
Geralt|She's not coming back. Period. And I don't blame her. I wouldn't want to return to a home like this, either.
Baron|Ah, horse bugger you blind. I know what you think already, you've no need to repeat it.
Baron|I've not been a good father, I know, but… perhaps it's not too late.
Geralt|Can always try. Wouldn't count on succeeding, though.
Baron|I've nothing to lose.
Geralt|Sooner you accept this, the better. Face it - you haven't been the best father.
Baron|I have not, true. But I'd change, I'd be different. If only she'd return, if only they'd both come back.
Baron|Maybe all is not yet lost! She's in Oxenfurt, you say? Maybe she hasn't left, maybe she'll hear me out.
Geralt|You can always try. Wouldn't get my hopes up, though.
Baron|I shall try. I must. Life is pointless without her and Anna. I've nothin' to lose.
Baron|Incidentally, what of my Annie? Learned anything?
Geralt|Never said I saw her. I talked to the man who took her in.
Geralt|Tamara's not in any danger, she's safe and sound. That I know.
Geralt|She doesn't wanna come back - made that clear. But she's safe and sound.
Baron|I'm listenin'. What do you come to me with?
Baron|Any news for me?
Baron|She screamed like a madwoman. In an instant, all had forgotten the wager.
Baron|Every man ran - to save his skin, even were he to break his neck.
Geralt|And? They make it?
Baron|Some, aye. Others were not so fortunate. But what happened then… I must say, witcher - seen a lot, but nothing like this, never.
Geralt|Uh oh. I know that look.
Baron|You're a fast learner. You'll know the rest once you find my wife.
Geralt|Working on it.
Baron|And making piss poor progress.
Geralt|They split up - hadn't considered that possibility before. But don't worry, I'll find Anna, too.
<|endoftext|>
Baron|Arrrrrr!
Baron|For Temeria!
Baron|I see you waning, pricklicker!
Baron|Ploughin' gone doolally, witcher?
Baron|You wait! I'll ploughin' smash you.
Baron|Hrrr hrrr hrr hrrrr…
Baron|Fuckin' get over here!
Baron|What the bloody hell?!
Baron|Uh-huh?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|How's it feel to rule? Jarls giving you any trouble?
Cerys|They're all very understandin', they seem to believe in me. Besides Lugos, o' course.
Geralt|Tried talking to him? Could still win him over…
Cerys|I don't know about that. He's more mule-headed than my father. But I'll try, o' course.
Geralt|How's Hjalmar feeling in his new role? Hope it hasn't gone to his head.
Cerys|No, da's been keepin' my dear brother's feet on the ground.
Geralt|Yeah? So no war with Nilfgaard?
Cerys|That's unavoidable, I'm afraid. It's not just Hjalmar - everyone wants it.
Geralt|Everyone… except you.
Cerys|War's death and destruction, even if it's in defense. Yes, I'd rather avoid it if there were a way.
Cerys|But… folk say the Black Ones will attack sooner or later. When they do, I'm glad Hjalmar will lead us into battle.
Geralt|Sad when someone like Bran dies… Everyone says he was a good king.
Cerys|It's not fittin' to speak elsewise about the dead.
Geralt|Mean you don't agree?
Cerys|Bran spent his life at sea, and while he was away, old feuds flared, devourin' the Isles from the inside. Folk grew furious, claimin' there was no one to mediate, resolve quarrels.
Cerys|But then Bran would return with loot, throw a feast, let the mead flow in rivers… And everyone loved him again.
Geralt|Farewell.
Geralt|Got a minute?
Geralt|Your Royal Majesty, would you spare a moment?
Cerys|C'mon, Geralt. I'm the same lass I was. Save for the title, not a thing's changed.

Novigrad Prostitute 01|Well, who do we have here…? I'm cursed, is that why you've come? Gonna lift it with a kiss?
Geralt|You available?
Novigrad Prostitute 01|Mhm.
Geralt|Tell me about yourself.
Novigrad Prostitute 01|Why would I?
Geralt|I'm interested, curious.
Novigrad Prostitute 01|I'd rather not.
Geralt|Not this time, thanks.
Novigrad Prostitute 01|Good to see you again, master.
Geralt|Hey there.
Novigrad Prostitute 01|Lookin' for somethin' unusual, are you?
Novigrad Prostitute 01|Remember me?
Geralt|Course I do.
Novigrad Prostitute 01|So?
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Prostitute 02|My sister mentioned a witcher'd come to town.
Geralt|Sister had it right.
Novigrad Prostitute 02|Do you want me? Hmm?
Geralt|I like you. Like to spend the night with you.
Novigrad Prostitute 02|You won't be disappointed.
Geralt|Why do you work here?
Novigrad Prostitute 02|Why? There's nothin' wrong in it.
Geralt|Ever thought about where you might be fifteen years down the line?
Novigrad Prostitute 02|Runnin' my own brothel, I wager. Puttin' coin away towards it as we speak.
Geralt|Take care, now.
Novigrad Prostitute 02|You're back.
Novigrad Prostitute 02|What'll it be? Same as last time?
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Prostitute 03|Here to plough?
Geralt|That's a bit direct, but yeah… Think we can have some fun.
Novigrad Prostitute 03|All right. Come on.
Geralt|Don't like your job much, do you?
Novigrad Prostitute 03|I wager many despise what they do for a livin'. My man cleans the catches brought into port. He can bathe half the day yet he'll always stink. My mother fashions pots - hands so calloused you could cut yourself on 'em.
Novigrad Prostitute 03|Ten years on my arse is sure to be like… Eh, waste of words. But we all got to make a livin' somehow.
Novigrad Prostitute 03|So, you aim to take me or not?
Geralt|Some other time, maybe.
Novigrad Prostitute 03|Word is witchers don't never get their fill of ploughin'. Must be somethin' to it if you're back. Am I to strip off my rags?
Novigrad Prostitute 03|Ah, it's you. The all nighter. Should I unwrap my charms?
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Prostitute 01|Greetings to the honorable gentleman. Welcome, make yourself at home. What have you come for? We're prepared to fulfill your every whim.
Geralt|I like you, like how you look, like how you smell…
Novigrad Prostitute 01|If that's so, let's discuss what might happen next.
Geralt|The Passiflora certainly deserves its reputation.
Novigrad Prostitute 01|We do all to please our patrons and make sure to turn the rabble away.
Geralt|Nice meeting you.
Novigrad Prostitute 01|We're honored to have the esteemed gentleman pay us another visit, come back for more, as it were. What would you like?
Novigrad Prostitute 01|Pleasure to see you again.
Geralt|Likewise.
Novigrad Prostitute 01|Any special wishes?
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Prostitute 02|Welcome to the Passiflora.
Geralt|Let's go upstairs.
Novigrad Prostitute 02|I see. All right, but we've terms to agree first.
Geralt|Can't help wondering how the Temple Guard treats you.
Novigrad Prostitute 02|With interest. They come by rather often.
Geralt|Far as I remember, Church of the Eternal Fire doesn't exactly condone these practices.
Novigrad Prostitute 02|The Church is the Church, and men are men. Not much consistency there. Now, tell me what you want.
Geralt|Take care.
Novigrad Prostitute 02|Welcome back to our humble boudoir. How can we help?
Novigrad Prostitute 02|You're back. How nice.
<|endoftext|>
Elf Female 03|Welcome, sir. We trust our charms and skills will prove to your liking. What is it you wish?
Geralt|I'm tired. Like to relax with a beautiful woman. Preferably an elf.
Elf Female 03|You've chosen well.
Geralt|You're an elf.
Elf Female 03|Easily recognized. I'm proud of it, never thought to conceal it in any way.
Geralt|From what I know, elves in Novigrad aren't exactly treated in a civil manner.
Elf Female 03|That's putting it lightly.
Elf Female 03|But this is not the place to discuss that. You've come seeking pleasure, not to hear out complaints.
Geralt|Take care of yourself. Might be back.
Elf Female 03|I remember you. And I'm glad you've returned.
Elf Female 03|Hmmm… Greetings.
Elf Female 03|Greetings.
Elf Female 03|Nice to see you.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Well, well. Carduin of Lan Exeter, head of the Conclave of Mages. Or should I say the Conclave of Mages-Not-Yet-Turned-To-Ash-At-The-Stake?
Carduin|What do you want?
Geralt|Seems to me it's a golden age for the Conclave, for mages in general, huh?
Carduin|We've seen the dawn of hard times for mages. The Conclave does everything in its power to help them survive.
Geralt|Is that a fact? Hm, as long as they don't mind being yoked and muzzled.
Carduin|And I say it's easy to play the hero, die a foolish death. But someone must survive, preserve our body of knowledge for future generations. You don't understand, you cannot… but sometimes it takes courage to be a coward.
Geralt|Radovid pleased with the witch hunts?
Carduin|No. And he shan't be until he sees Philippa Eilhart atop a pyre.
Geralt|Your king doesn't forget easily.
Carduin|Such things as she did to His Majesty are impossible to forget.
Geralt|Farewell.
Carduin|What now?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|You play gwent?
Verden Boy 04|They say Haddy's dim, but that just ain't true. Haddy don't know how to plow or sow, nor catch no fishes. But he can sure play cards.
Verden Boy 04|So, aye, Haddy plays gwent.
Geralt|So let's play.
Geralt|We'll play another time.
Geralt|Would Haddy like to play a round of gwent?
Verden Boy 04|Course he would.
Verden Boy 04|Haddy done lost - it happens. Take your prize.
Verden Boy 04|'Addy's not clever, nay. Finds no mushrooms save his own stinkhorn. But! But! But! 'Addy can sure play cards!
Geralt|Know who else might be worth playing?
Verden Boy 04|Haddy heard the hermit gabbin' to hisself. Old goat said Zoltan Chivay and Crach an Craite got rare cards. But who they are, Haddy don't know.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Ever play gwent?
Baron|I do, and what's more, I usually win. If you've a deck, sit down. Outplay me, and I'll give you one of my unique cards. How's that for enticement?
Geralt|Let's lay 'em down.
Geralt|We'll play another time.
Geralt|In the mood for a round of gwent?
Baron|Haha! I'm always in the mood for gwent.
Baron|You're not complete shite, but you really should work on your technique. Stop by again sometime, we'll play another round.
Baron|You win. Well, made my bed, now I've got to lie in it. There's your card.
Geralt|Thanks. Few ever come into rarities like this.
Baron|Hm. I've heard of a dwarf in Novigrad - Zoltan… surname escapes me. And there's a traveling cobbler who clings to the Nilfgaardians like he was the stench from their foot wrappings.
Baron|Ah, you won. A man's only as good as his word - take the card. I fear Velen's short on worthy opponents. Boat builder in Oreton might be one. There was also an old soothsayer, lived east of here near the windmill, last I heard.
Baron|There's a lad... about as reasonable as an old mare, but he plays a devilish hand. In fact, I don't rightly know that you're ready for him.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Wanted to ask you…
Verden Old Man 03|Aye, I play gwent. And aye, we can play for the prize card in me collection.
Geralt|You a mind reader?
Verden Old Man 03|The good gods did… bless me with some precognition. I say some, 'cause it's selective like… only applies to mundane matters.
Verden Old Man 03|Not a bird'll ever shit on me. But all my foresight's never helped me win at gwent.
Geralt|Let's lay 'em out.
Geralt|We'll play another time.
Geralt|Another round?
Verden Old Man 03|Sure. Only diversion we get in this wasteland.
Verden Old Man 03|The good gods saw fit to let me win. Drop in for another round some time.
Verden Old Man 03|So is the soothsayer's lot. I'll know where to find the finest slippery jacks this fall, but how to play and not lose? That I'll never know.
Verden Old Man 03|A beautiful win. Take this card - you deserve it.
Geralt|Know of any others who play gwent?
Verden Old Man 03|You've but one opponent worth your while in Velen. In the village of Midcopse. They calls him Haddy. He's a tyke, barely a handful of summers to him, but don't let that fool ye.
Verden Old Man 03|As we played, before my eyes shown a vision - an elven merchant near Oxenfurt. And from that same city, an innkeep named Stjepan. In my vision, ye played 'em both.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|They say you play cards.
Verden Peasant 05|They don't speak idly, then. Times're tough, and rare cards're often worth more than a fistful o' gold. So, will ye play?
Geralt|Let's.
Geralt|Got more important things to tend to at the moment.
Geralt|Innkeep, up for a round of cards?
Verden Peasant 05|Course I am. Shall we play?
Verden Peasant 05|Must admit, I scoffed and lost. Well, stupidity's got its price. My prize card's yours.
Geralt|Ah, damn. Lost.
Verden Peasant 05|Ye might look to your deck, change it up, do better.
Geralt|Who else plays gwent around here?
Verden Peasant 05|Haddy - little scoundrel down Midcopse way. And afore Temeria fell, well, Vernon Roche were famous for his deck. Don't know that he still lives, let alone if he plays.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Heard you're a good boatwright and an even better card player.
Verden Peasant 01|Ye wanna play?
Geralt|Always ready for a round.
Geralt|I'll be back - need to look through my deck.
Geralt|Up for a round of cards?
Verden Peasant 01|Why not. Let's play.
Verden Peasant 01|Ye lost, but ye needn't get your breeches in a bunch. Round here they say bad luck at cards means good luck at love. Proven true in my case - wench I live with's not fit for nothin'.
Geralt|Rules say the card's mine.
Verden Peasant 01|Aye, 'tis indeed. Gods, believe you're good enough to try your luck 'gainst Haddy. Folk laugh at 'im 'cause he's young and a bit dim, but word is he weren't afraid to beat the baron hisself.
Verden Peasant 01|Seein' as you've robbed me of me best card, you're sure to wanna hear about two other unique cards. Had me eye on both once.
Verden Peasant 01|Went clear to Novigrad for one of them - though true, 'twas before the war. Saw a certain Marquise Serenity. I've only heard folk tell of the second. Gremist, a venerable druid of Skellige, holds it.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Did I hear right? Word is you like to play cards.
Talar|I like to play, period. Dice, cards, chess… I unwind playin' games. You askin' cause you got fuck all to talk about, or are you in the mood for a round?
Geralt|All right. Let's play. Just remember - only interested in good cards, don't want any trash.
Geralt|We'll play, there'll come a time for that.
Geralt|What do you play these days?
Talar|Whatever any cocksucker wants to challenge me to. How do cards sound?
Talar|Melitele's rotting cunt! Know how long it took me to assemble that ploughin' deck?
Geralt|You've been at this for a while - gotta know some players who are good. And, what's more, have good cards.
Talar|Been hearin' a lot of late about some prick named Lambert. Supposed to have an evil fuckin' deck. You might know him, actually - he's a witcher.
Talar|Bit off more than you could chew, witcher. Heheheh…
Talar|There's Vimme Vivaldi - Novigrad banker. Been buildin' his deck for years. Women play, too, you know. Marquise Serenity, for instance… an expert player with a truly stacked deck.
Talar|Melitele's rotting cunt! Know how long it took me to assemble that ploughin' deck?
Geralt|Nope. Hey, know any other players who're good? And, what's more, have good cards?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|You ever play gwent?
Crach|Hah! Ermion taught me the rules and gave me a deck. Wish to play?
Geralt|Let's play a quick round.
Geralt|We'll play another time.
Crach|Not shabby. But you could use some better cards.
Crach|You're good! Know what, Wolf? I've this rare card here - take it, it'll be of more use to you.
Geralt|Thanks.
Crach|You might consider challenging a man in Kaer Trolde village. A worthy adversary, though a mere tailor. Sjusta's his name.
Crach|Ermion mentioned the druid Gremist. Apparently has similar rare beauties, as does some hermit in Velen. Pay them a visit if you care to expand your collection.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Gwent - ever play the game?
Gremista|If your question is, would I be interested in playing you, the answer is simple: no.
Geralt|Afraid of losing? I understand.
Gremista|Very well, out with your deck. Win, and I'll give you my best card.
Geralt|Fine, your choice.
Geralt|Gwent. Play me, Gremist.
Gremista|Feeble. But I expected as much.
Gremista|That was luck, pure luck. Nonetheless, as promised, the jewel of my collection - Assire var Anahid.
Gremista|Now you must do me a favor. Since you're so lucky, you must fleece Sigi Reuven in Novigrad and Stjepan in Oxenfurt. I found both exceedingly aggravating last time I was on the Continent. Best of luck.
Gremista|You won. I believe you're ready to challenge Madman Lugos. I do wonder if he'll agree to play you for his Katakan.
Gremista|You outplayed me… Were Madman Lugos alive, I'd say you might challenge him for his Katakan with those skills. Incidentally, none knows what happened to the card after he passed on.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Gwent - know the game?
Lugos The Mad|Do gulls shit off cliffs? Let's see your deck. Been a dull day - we'll play for my Katakan.
Geralt|Show me what you can do.
Geralt|We'll play some other time.
Geralt|Care for a round of gwent?
Lugos The Mad|Sure!
Lugos The Mad|Haha! I won! Come by for another round sometime!
Lugos The Mad|Dyin' to gut ye, but then they'd say Lugos had gone even madder. Take my Katakan and sod off.
Geralt|Before I sod off with your Katakan, would you tell me who else I could play?
Lugos The Mad|Played one of your brethren a time ago - Lambert. Sailed here to kill a slyzard. And there's some baron lives in Velen. They say he's got the John Natalis card.
Geralt|Thanks.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Wouldn't happen to play gwent would you?
Ermion|Certainly! I got my first deck, oh, years ago, back in Cintra. Proceeded to teach the game to half of Skellige. Why do you ask - looking to play?
Geralt|Yeah, glad to play a round.
Geralt|Another time, maybe.
Geralt|Got time to play cards…?
Ermion|I don't… ah, dog's arse, let's play.
Ermion|Chin up. No shame in losing to me.
Ermion|Lovely! My congratulations! You've a good deck, but it could use a bit of supplementation.
Ermion|Here - take this card.
Geralt|Thanks.
Ermion|You've a knack for it, so much so you ought to challenge Crach. I gave him his deck, introduced him to the game, but the pupil has surpassed his master. There's also Gremist. A vile character, but undeniably talented.
Ermion|If you wish to add to your collection, play Sjusta or Madman Lugos. Neither is capable of refusing a round or two.
Ermion|If you wish to add to your collection, play Sjusta - he shan't refuse. Madman Lugos would also never turn down a match - I'll miss him in that respect.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Any chance you play gwent?
Tailor Sjusta|Oh, aye, it's a great passion. Wanna play?
Geralt|I'm ready. Let's do this.
Geralt|Definitely, once I find some time.
Geralt|Care for a game of gwent?
Tailor Sjusta|Always, anytime.
Tailor Sjusta|What can I say - a tailor-made victory. Better luck next time, witcher.
Tailor Sjusta|Bravo! A grand win - congratulations!
Tailor Sjusta|You'll not find any worthy opponents here in Skellige. Skills like that you oughta test in Velen.
Tailor Sjusta|Play the baron, or that famous lad Haddy. Now those are opponents for you!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Ever play gwent?
Dijkstra|I do. Gwent's like politics, just more honest.
Dijkstra|Care for a game against an old master?
Geralt|Yeah, let's play.
Geralt|I'll stop by some other time, we'll play then.
Geralt|Time for a round of cards?
Dijkstra|Ah, yes, sure.
Dijkstra|Know what? You should really stick to killing monsters.
Dijkstra|Not bad. See you don't have Esterad Thyssen in your deck. Here, he's yours.
Geralt|Thanks. Know anyone else I could win some cards off of?
Dijkstra|Hm… I know an elf you might try. Got an excellent card in his deck. You'll find him beyond the city walls, where the Scoia'tael stragglers have their shantytown.
Dijkstra|There's Olivier at the Kingfisher. I play him sometimes. And there was a spell there I hoped to win the Katakan off Madman Lugos, but after I beat him once the bugger would never play me again.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Round of gwent?
Zoltan Chivay|I never refuse.
Geralt|Let's play.
Geralt|Tell you what - not right now, but I'll be back.
Geralt|Up for some gwent?
Zoltan Chivay|Course!
Zoltan Chivay|Ach, Geralt, Geralt. Come back for a rematch sometime - we gotta work on your gwent skills.
Geralt|Seems I won.
Zoltan Chivay|A right fuckin' shock given your frankly amateur deck. Here, take this card, you need it.
Zoltan Chivay|Ye'd do well to fix your collection. It's downright porous. Don't need ye bringin' me shame, got Dandelion for that. Ye might skim somethin' off your mate, Roche. He's said to have good cards, that one.
Zoltan Chivay|Try it out on Vimme Vivaldi, at once, if you can. If things go your way, you could win a unique one off him.
Zoltan Chivay|Or try your luck with that fogey in Velen. They say he lives along the road to the Nilfgaardian camp. Word is he's got great cards, that one.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|You play gwent?
Stjepan Innkeeper|Not with just anybody and always for high stakes. With you - I might.
Geralt|I'll play on your terms.
Geralt|Know what? We'll play later.
Geralt|A round of gwent?
Stjepan Innkeeper|Why not, but you know my rules - high stakes always.
Stjepan Innkeeper|Perhaps you should come back once you've got a better deck. Or when you learn to play.
Stjepan Innkeeper|I don't like losin', but that don't mean I don't do it with grace. The card and the prize are yours.
Geralt|You been playing a while. Gotta know where I can find some interesting cards.
Stjepan Innkeeper|In Novigrad, there's Olivier the innkeeper. He plays, though he's far beneath my level. Closer, in Velen, there's the barkeep at the Inn at the Crossroads.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Looking for a partner. Wouldn't mind a round of gwent.
Olivier Kingfisher|Then you are in the right place, friend. If you'll play now, I'll stake the unique card from my collection.
Geralt|Sure, let's play.
Geralt|Play you some other time.
Olivier Kingfisher|So, shall we play?
Olivier Kingfisher|Personally, I'd 'ave played that hand differently. But… that's just my opinion.
Olivier Kingfisher|You win, card's yours.
Geralt|Know anyone else who has good cards, you know, the one-offs, hard-to-finds?
Olivier Kingfisher|Commander Vernon Roche plays, that I know. And one of your kind, a witcher, stopped in for a round once. Name was… Lambert.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Ever play gwent?
Lambert|Of course. Even tried to teach Vesemir, but turned out he's just mule-headed. Why do you ask? Up for a quick hand?
Geralt|Pff, am I. Have you crying like a baby by the time I'm through with you.
Geralt|We'll play some other time.
Geralt|So, wanna play?
Lambert|Of course.
Lambert|Aaaand you lost. Get you a hankie for your tears?
Lambert|You won, you won't see me crying, though. You might squeeze some tears out of that boatwright in Velen - seemed like the sensitive type.
Lambert|Or try the cobbler who hangs around the Nilfgaardian camp. Here's a card for your deck, in case you get in trouble.
Lambert|You win. Ugh, can't believe I gotta give up my unique card. Mh, better your hands than someone else's, I guess.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|You play gwent, don't you?
Vimme Vivaldi|Oh, sure, 'cause I'm a dwarf, is that it? Do you also believe I know every other bleedin' dwarf in existence, and that at the end of each day I deepen the mineshaft in my cellar?
Geralt|So you play or not?
Vimme Vivaldi|Aye, I play.
Geralt|So play me. Stake a unique card, maybe?
Vimme Vivaldi|Why not.
Geralt|Still out to beat me?
Vimme Vivaldi|Ah, see your still seekin' to lose. I'm game.
Geralt|Play you later. Gotta go now.
Vimme Vivaldi|Try some shoddier players, will ye? Once you've learned a few tricks, come back for a rematch.
Vimme Vivaldi|Can't rightly recall the last time I was so thoroughly thrashed. The card's yours.
Geralt|Tried your best. Tell me, who else could have worthwhile cards?
Vimme Vivaldi|There's Marquise Serenity, for instance. She don't boast about it, but she has one of the best decks in town and uses it damn well. I know what I'm talkin' about.
Vimme Vivaldi|Hm, some Scoia'tael dregs hang about Oxenfurt. There's an elf among 'em has a unique. I've also heard tell of a druid named Ermion. Bugger's deck is supposedly legendary.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|You play gwent?
Scoiatael Man 02|Do you really have no one else to play with?
Geralt|Always nice to play someone new.
Scoiatael Man 02|Fine, beggars can't be choosers, after all. I'll play you… and even stake one of my unique cards.
Geralt|Pull out your cards.
Geralt|Listen, we'll play later.
Geralt|Care for a rematch?
Scoiatael Man 02|Hmm… why not.
Scoiatael Man 02|Not only did I finally come across an opponent… But I beat him thoroughly. A fine day.
Scoiatael Man 02|Damn it all, I'd so hoped for victory. Alas, so be it - you've won the card fair and square.
Geralt|Know anyone else I could play?
Scoiatael Man 02|Sjusta may still play - he was one of us once, but he's in Skellige now, fled a conviction. I know not for what. Oh, and there's the innkeep at the Inn at the Crossroads, but that one's a true prick.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|You play gwent, Roche?
Roche|Yes, but I've none to play against here. If you've got a deck, pull it out.
Geralt|Good luck.
Geralt|We'll play, later.
Geralt|A round of gwent?
Roche|Gladly.
Roche|Stop by sometime for another round.
Roche|You won. Congratulations. Here, you earned the card.
Geralt|Know anyone else worth playing?
Roche|I've heard of a man, came through Novigrad recently. You might be interested to know he's also a witcher. Lambert they call him.
Geralt|Old Lambert's a card sharp…? Interesting, indeed.
Roche|Then I've a mate who's to come up from the south. He likes cards, a rather refined player. But it seems he's better at being late, Wouldn't wait if I were you.
Roche|I've heard of a man, came through Novigrad recently. You might be interested to know he's also a witcher. Lambert they call him.
Geralt|I know Lambert. Had no idea he played gwent, though.
Roche|Not the only acquaintance you can challenge. Thaler's a keen gambler and has a sharp deck. He's in the area, you might try him…
Roche|Your old friend from Skellige, Crach an Craite - word is he's got an interesting collection. And there's a boatwright in Velen - whittles boats by day, plays gwent nights. Try them.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|I'm curious - you play gwent?
Marquise Serenity|Certainly. Though for high stakes exclusively, of course. In fact, the game would be exceedingly boring without the risk.
Geralt|Up for a round?
Marquise Serenity|Why yes, let's play.
Geralt|We'll play, a little later.
Marquise Serenity|I fail to understand how I lost that. Hmph, I believe this card belongs to you.
Geralt|Know any other players willing to stake rare cards?
Marquise Serenity|In Novigrad, Sigi Reuven's collection is famous. You really should challenge him.
Marquise Serenity|Well, hard luck. I'll gladly play you again some time.
Marquise Serenity|A druid, Ermion of Skellige. And in Novigrad, well, Sigi Reuven's collection is quite famous.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|The tournament - where do I sign up to play?
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Right here with me. I've one slot open, but there's a condition - you must use cards of the Skellige faction.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|You see, I've already asked a great many seasoned players to do the same. Alas, all fear novelties, disdain process, care too much for the climax, for winning. So they insist on playing with their tried and true decks.
Geralt|Long story short, you need a sucker who'll risk it, take a stab at proving Skellige's no worse than the established decks. Best way to do that'd be to win this tournament using your brother's cards.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|We understand one another perfectly, I see.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Behold this trophy, standing stiff and strong - it could be yours if you win.
Geralt|All right. I'll give it a shot, play using the new faction.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|That is an exceedingly good rub to my loins!
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Just one small adjoinder - I can only provide you a basic Skellige deck. My brother, alas, gave away or lost many key cards.
Geralt|No chance I can win the tournament with these cards?
Toussaint Noble Man 02|An issue easily resolved - you must simply face local gwent competitors, win the missing cards from them. Besides, it would be very good practice for the tournament itself.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Here, the cards I can spare you. Take them, please. The rest I keep for myself, for I, too, intend to play as Skellige.
Geralt|Already got a good enough deck to play in the tournament as Skellige.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Might I have a peek?
Toussaint Noble Man 02|You do, indeed! Come back in two days' time, then - for the start of the tourney.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Just remember, the cards I gave you form but the base deck.
Geralt|Thanks for the offer, but… not really in the mood to play.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|A shame. Though mood has little to do with a real man's performance. The tourney's yet to begin, so should you change your mind, you know where to find me.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|And in a bid to coax you into reconsidering, I shall give you the cards for a core Skellige deck. The rest I keep for myself, for I, too, intend to play as Skellige.
Geralt|Thanks. So long.
Geralt|0x00127d7a
Geralt|Hm, not bad. Could look great in my house - on the sideboard, maybe.
Geralt|These new cards - tell me something about them?
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Their design embodies the isles' spirit - the rage-filled potency, the rough, brutal beauty. Famed Skelligers, heroes of lore, berserkers and beasts ogle us from the cards.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Bran Tuirseach is the faction's leader, of course.
Geralt|And the other famous Skelligers?
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Hjalmar and Cerys an Craite, naturally, though not conjoined. Also Hemdall the Hero, the venerable druid Ermion… the list goes on.
Geralt|New deck? Where'd you get the idea? I mean, why bother?
Toussaint Noble Man 02|All Beauclair knows me as a great lover and promoter of gwent. My brother, dead for some time now, was known to be the same.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|We shared another great passion - travel. Spent a great many years at sea in our youth, marking out our territory, heheh, in multiple corners of the world. Yet the one that truly grabbed us by the stones were the Skellige Isles.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|The stormy sea, consumed by a fever, a suicidal awe, dashing itself against somber cliffs - that is the image I retain. It and others like it inspired my brother to devise the new faction.
Geralt|Greetings.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|I trust you've reconsidered your decision. Will you try your luck in our tournament, after all?
Toussaint Noble Man 01|The tournament - am I too late to sign up?
Toussaint Noble Man 02|We've one slot free for anyone willing to play the Skellige deck.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|I assure you, Skellige is just as strong as the other factions. It shall soon be considered canon, of this I'm certain.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|I don't know. Always been a Nilfgaard man myself… I must give it some more thought.
Geralt|Geralt of Rivia. Saw a notice about a gwent tournament…
Toussaint Noble Man 02|By all means, you've come to the right place. I am Count Martin Monnier, organizer in chief.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Our tourney's more than mere diversion. We've a mission, see? To spread word of my brother's brainchild - Skellige, a new gwent faction.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Knight 01|Welcome. The tourney is under way. Might I glance at your deck?
Geralt|Sure. Here.
Toussaint Knight 01|An impressive array. Count Monnier waits inside. You may enter.
Geralt|Thanks.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|There you are! A pleasure to see you again. The Skellige faction - how do you find it?
Geralt|It's great. Faction's a pleasure to play.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|I'm glad to hear it.
Geralt|Any specific tournament rules? Mind giving me an overview?
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Firstly, might I introduce the contestants? Superb gwent players, all, hailing from the world's farthest corners - Hamal ogn Dangbahli, an Ofieri merchant.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Eric van Vrog, a patrician from Novigrad. And lastly, we are proud to welcome a Skelliger…
Gwent Player Skellige|You blind? Not Skelliger. Skelligirl, dammit!
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Naturally, no offense meant. Agnetha Skold, her ever-charming isle temperament in evidence, along with assorted beads, baubles, ropes…
Toussaint Noble Man 02|As to the rules, they're simple. Each player adopts a faction they cannot change for the tourney's duration. Lose a match, and you're eliminated.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|The winner from among you shall advance to the semifinal to face the winner of the tourney's previous edition, His Excellency the Ambassador of the Empire of Nilfgaard, Master von Hinn.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|The winner of that match shall in turn face none other than me, your humble servant.
Angry Dwarf 01|Hands off our gwent!
Angry Dwarf 04|No new fuckin' factions!
Geralt|Ready to start if everybody else is.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|I invite you to join me on the terrace. The herald shall soon announce the tourney's start.
Geralt|Protestors have gathered outside. Quite a few, it seems.
Angry Dwarf 04|Hands off our bloody game! We dinnae want any new factions!
Angry Dwarf 01|Monnier, ye dozy cunt! Stop diddlin' with dwarven tradition!
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Change cannot always please everyone. Gwent traditionalists resent my efforts to expand the canon to include Skellige. But we shall pay them no mind.
Geralt|Mind telling me what factions the others'll be playing?
Toussaint Noble Man 02|It is no secret. Eric van Vrog will play the Northern Realms. His Excellency, in a flush of patriotism, chose Nilfgaard.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Hamal ogn Dangbahli will play the Monsters deck, and Agnetha Skold has chosen Scoia'tael.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Yours truly, of course, shall await the winner with a Skellige deck. I'm determined to prove its value.
Geralt|Honestly? Not one of my favorites.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Hmph, yet I believe you will easily win the tournament wielding it.
Gwent Player Skellige|If ye're thinkin' women can't play gwent for shite, ye're dead wrong.
Gwent Player Ofir|Primal participation is, whereas vindicating victory would be.
Gwent Player Novigrad|I've got a lady as my first opponent. Reckon I'm sitting in the catbird seat.
Gwent Player Embassador|This year once more I aim to prove Nilfgaard knows no equal.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|May we all play fair, show respect for our opponents and may the best amongst us win.
Geralt|Pure gold.
Angry Dwarf 01|Gwent was perfected by dwarves o'er centuries o' play! Not about to accept some new bloody faction!
Angry Dwarf 03|Just you wait. A year on and some tosser'll have invented the "Wankers of Novigrad" faction!
Angry Dwarf 02|Gwent dinnae need changin'! Leave it the fuck alone!
Angry Dwarf 02|Get yer mingin' mitts off our fucking gwent!
Angry Dwarf 04|Duvvelsheyss! Four factions since time immemorial gwent's had! An' it should buggerin' stay that way!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Let's grab a table.
Gwent Player Ofir|A wager would you wish to make?
Geralt|What'd you have in mind?
Gwent Player Ofir|Weapons do I collect, and your sword of silver my eye has caught. Should I win, I should take it. Should I lose, to you another, equally precious shall I give.
Gwent Player Ofir|That is… no sword at your side have you, but a witcher you are, thus concealed them you must have…
Geralt|My swords, my concern. Don't need 'em to play gwent. Cards is all that takes.
Gwent Player Ofir|If you so say…
Geralt|All right. So it be.
Geralt|Sword's how I earn my keep. Can't risk it, won't. I say we play for the normal stakes.
Toussaint Squire 01|Let the tourney begin!
Toussaint Squire 01|In round one, Agnetha Skold faces Eric von Vrog!
Toussaint Squire 01|And Geralt of Rivia plays Hamal ogn Dangbahli!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Good match. Thanks.
Gwent Player Ofir|And upon your victory, congratulate I you. What drove me to wager a sword against you, know I not. Clearly to guide me the Universe ceased.
Gwent Player Ofir|Here, you may it serve well.
Gwent Player Novigrad|I'd never have lost if you hadn't cheated!
Gwent Player Skellige|In my land, folk who slander like that don't live long! 'Cause we don't let 'em!
Gwent Player Skellige|Accuse me of cheatin' again, and I'll cut yer tongue out.
Toussaint Knight 01|Enough! Hands to yourselves!
Toussaint Squire 01|As gwent is a gentleman's sport, we expect all its players to demonstrate impeccable manners, and we cannot tolerate any disturbances.
Toussaint Squire 01|Thus, by decision of Count Monnier, the contestants from Novigrad and Skellige are hereby disqualified.
Gwent Player Skellige|Gentleman's sport - bah! Well, I'm a lady. And we ladies don't give a flyin' fart about a tourney where any measly prick can accuse us of cheatin'!
Toussaint Squire 01|With round one completed, the standings are as follows. Geralt of Rivia - eliminated. Agnetha Skold and Eric von Vrog - both disqualified. Consequently, His Excellency the Ambassador of Nilfgaard shall now face Hamal ogn Dangbahli.
Toussaint Squire 01|With round one completed, the standings are as follows. Agnetha Skold and Eric van Vrog - both disqualified. Geralt of Rivia has defeated Hamal ogn Dangbahli of Ofier. In the semifinal, Geralt shall face the defending champion, Ambassador von Hinn!
Gwent Player Embassador|I am honored.
Geralt|Kinda regret not risking it, now, not playing you for the sword.
Gwent Player Ofir|A well-deserved victory - congratulate I you.
Geralt|Dammit. Not just out of the tournament, lost my sword, too.
Gwent Player Ofir|Thus in life goes it ever, one's fortune another's misfortune requires. For a match good, thank I you.
Geralt|Congratulations. Lucky I didn't bet my sword.
Gwent Player Ofir|A good match. Thank I you.
Geralt|Kinda regret coming unarmed, now.
Gwent Player Ofir|Offer I did…
Geralt|Glad I came here unarmed. Might've been tempted to raise the stakes, then lost big.
Gwent Player Ofir|Whereas for this reason selfsame, disappointed I am somewhat.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Your Excellency, a pure pleasure to play you.
Gwent Player Embassador|The pleasure was mutual, I assure you. Congratulations, witcher.
Angry Dwarf 01|Stop desecratin' gwent!
Angry Dwarf 04|Death tae any and all new factions!
Geralt|Seems there's some trouble brewing…
Angry Dwarf 03|Scoot - all o' youse! Off yer arses and hie to Skellige, ye isle-lovin' seal-slurpers!
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Please remain calm and stop the verbal attacks.
Angry Dwarf 04|Stop yer mum from fuckin' ferrets, Monnier! And hands off our gwent!
Geralt|Get out of here. Before my patience runs thin.
Angry Dwarf 03|Hear that? Guttershite's threatenin' us! Only one answer tae verbal aggression o' that sort!
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Once more, I beg and plead - remain calm…
Angry Dwarf 04|Shut yer yap, Monnier!
Angry Dwarf 01|Enough o' this! Dinnae come here to jabber, but to break fuckin' heids in defense o' tradition! C'mon, lads!
Geralt|Maybe instead of hollering threats, you oughta just explain what it is you want.
Angry Dwarf 01|We've said it, plenty o' times. Yet no one ever listens!
Geralt|Got me listening.
Angry Dwarf 02|Gwent's an ancient pastime. Its rules were set ages ago.
Angry Dwarf 03|Exactly! Determined in keepin' wit' the laws o' nature!
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|There should be four factions. That is the optimal number!
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|We'll not tolerate the introduction of any others! It would disgrace the tradition!
Angry Dwarf 02|Aye! Leave our gwent the fuck alone!
Geralt|Congratulations. Good win.
Gwent Player Embassador|Thank you. An exciting match, to say the least.
Toussaint Squire 01|In the grand finale, Ambassador von Hinn shall face Count Monnier!
Gwent Player Embassador|It seems you had a stroke of ill luck.
Geralt|Your Excellency played better, that's all.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Squire 01|In the… pre-final Count Monnier, representing the Skellige faction, shall face Geralt of Rivia, also playing with a Skellige deck.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|My brother's dream has come true! Skellige in the final - and played by both contestants!
Geralt|Good luck.
Geralt|Cooled you off a bit.
Angry Dwarf 01|Fuck… Seein' triple… Quadruple, even…
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Enough! I shall summon the Guard.
Geralt|I got this, Count…
Geralt|Sure, you can shut this tournament down. But there'll be another. With who-knows-what new rules.
Geralt|If you don't like 'em, don't enter. Play somewhere else, however you want. But you'll never stop other folk from playing however they like.
Angry Dwarf 03|Bollocks!
Geralt|Like my good friend Zoltan Chivay says, if one says you're talking bollocks, they could be right, they could be wrong. But if multiples say you're talking bollocks, well, you probably are. So let's take a vote - who else here thinks I'm full of it?
Angry Dwarf 04|Zoltan Chivay? Havenae seen that rascal in ages! How's he doin'?
Geralt|Was in Novigrad last I saw him. Be glad to tell you more over a flask of something strong.
Angry Dwarf 04|Attention, everyone! Our outin's taken a new turn! We're to sit and drink vodka with Zoltan's pal!
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Gentlemen, wait. We've still the final round of the tourney to play.
Angry Dwarf 01|Final? Fuck that! I, Yaki Rafiberg, do hereby declare my participation in this tournament! And I demand to play the victor! We'll settle whether this Skellige faction's worth a flamin' bag o' shite! Once an' for all!
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Agreed, but please show some patience. We must first play… a pre-final.
Toussaint Squire 01|In the… pre-final Count Monnier, representing the Skellige faction, shall face Ambassador von Hinn, playing Nilfgaard!
Geralt|Zoltan's just fine.
Angry Dwarf 01|Had enough? Still got the urge tae add new factions?
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Congratulations! The best man has won - playing the best faction, to boot.
Geralt|Thanks, good game.
Angry Dwarf 01|Skellige won - what a bundle of pish! Tournament's not done. Now it's my turn.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|That is what we agreed. Let us resolve our differences here and now.
Toussaint Squire 01|The Grande Finale - witness it now! Count Monnier, playing the Skellige faction, against Yaki Rafiberg, playing…
Angry Dwarf 01|Scoia'tael!
Toussaint Squire 01|Let the better man… or dwarf… win!
Toussaint Squire 01|Now, to determine the ultimate victor, Geralt of Rivia, playing the Skellige faction, shall face Yaki Rafiberg, playing…
Angry Dwarf 01|Scoia'tael!
Toussaint Squire 01|Let the better man… or dwarf… win!
Toussaint Noble Man 02|I thank you for the game. No hard feelings, I trust?
Geralt|Skellige won, like you wanted. That's what matters.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Thank you for everything, witcher.
Geralt|No problem, had fun.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|I'm sorry you did not manage to qualify for the finals. I'd hoped to face you, but participation alone counts for something. Here, a consolation prize.
Geralt|Thanks.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Thank you once more for deigning to take part in my little tournament. I hope we shall meet again.
Geralt|Who knows… farewell.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|I am glad to have met you. I desire to do one more thing for you, witcher. Such is my nature. Is there any way I could be of service?
Geralt|During the tournament I lost my silver sword. I'd like to get it back, because that's how I earn my wages.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|I believe I shall be able to help.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Would you be so kind, good sir, as to agree to return Geralt his sword - in exchange for a blade once belonging to the famed knight Rydygier?
Gwent Player Ofir|Yes, but the sword of Rydygier in the sands of time sank…
Toussaint Noble Man 02|I assure you, that is far from the truth. In that case… it's settled.
Gwent Player Ofir|Fine is this blade, may it continue to well serve you.
Geralt|Thank you, count. And you, sir.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Generosity is a virtue.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|You proved yourself a true gwent master. Here, the grand prize - you earned it.
Geralt|Thank you very much, Count.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Yet most important of all to me is that you fulfilled my brother's wish, so I would like to give you something else.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|The most precious card of his collection. May it serve you well.
Geralt|Thanks. It's an honor, count.
Geralt|Don't think that went exactly as you'd planned.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|What matters is we played gwent, and I presented the Skellige faction.
Geralt|Thanks, good game.
Angry Dwarf 01|Bollock blisters, what hurts most is fuckin' Skellige won. But as they say, "tough shite." Congrats!
Angry Dwarf 01|C'mon, lads! Let's get soused!
Toussaint Noble Man 02|No, you must stay, for I wish to treat you all to a tipple! We must toast the premier of the new faction! And if anyone wishes to play a friendly match of gwent, I see no reason why not!
Angry Dwarf 01|I won! Now youse can shove all this Skellige mince up yer arses!
Geralt|You won 'cause you played better, not because the faction's weak.
Angry Dwarf 01|Aye, right, I knows what I saw.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Well played, thank you for a scintillating game. I trust my victory has convinced all doubters of the value of the new faction.
Angry Dwarf 01|Ye won 'cause ye played better. Even if ye hadnae played as ploughing Skellige, ye woulda won anyhow. Congrats all the same - Yaki Rafiberg's no sore loser.

Skellige Fisherman 01|This place could use a sweepin'. You even got a broom?
Skellige Woman 02|Mhm. I use it to swat pests, so ye best watch yourself.
Skellige Fisherman 01|I'll be watchin' for ye to sit on it and fly away!
Skellige Fisherman 01|Give us an ale, little dove.
Skellige Woman 02|Tell me, Bjern, do I look like Continental poultry to ye?
Skellige Fisherman 01|No…
Skellige Woman 02|Then drop the dovin'.
Skellige Woman 02|What now?
Skellige Fisherman 01|Your eyes! They're as beautiful as… as…
Skellige Woman 02|As? Come on, surprise me.
Skellige Fisherman 01|Well, as… stars. Argh.

Skellige Warrior 01|Wind blowin' in from the north, five foot waves… Our canvas torn to shreds, tiller had snapped in two…
Skellige Warrior 01|Suddenly, a siren breaches the water's surface right before my eyes! Beautiful, fair-faced, teets rollin' like the surf in winter…
Skellige Warrior 01|So, bam! I spring into action, wrap a line 'round her tail… And off she goes, draggin' the boat like an ox pullin' a cart! Then--
Skellige Fisherman 03|Bah! Them's bollocks you're talkin', Edvin.
Skellige Villager 02|What do you know 'bout the sea? You've spent your whole life tendin' sheep! And don't interrupt, there's some folk here wanna listen!
Skellige Villager 02|What about you, Leif. Ye famous for anythin'?
Skellige Fisherman 03|Me? Aye, for many things…
Skellige Villager 02|I'm all ears.
Skellige Fisherman 03|Well... eerrr... Recently…
Skellige Warrior 01|Recently Leif got drunk and mistook his hut for an outhouse. And that's about all he's got to brag about.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Fisherman 02|Ho-ho-ho! Congratulations on a job well done!
Skellige Boatbuilder 01|Ah, we gave it our best. Just one thing left - a figurehead for the prow, somethin' real fittin'.
Skellige Fisherman 02|What's there to think on? Carve it to look like me Sigrida!
Skellige Fisherman 02|She'll scare off krakens and put storms to shame with the fury on her brow!
Skellige Fisherman 02|I see you've used ash wood…
Skellige Boatbuilder 01|You see right.
Skellige Fisherman 02|Told ye I had some premium pine in me store.
Skellige Boatbuilder 01|Premium, aye - and dear as a devil's tears.
Skellige Fisherman 02|Ye can skimp on your hut, your grub, your horse… but not on your boat. Or you'll go down with it.
Skellige Fisherman 02|Sixteen pair of oars? Who's the longboat for?
Skellige Boatbuilder 01|Madman Lugos ordered it.
Skellige Fisherman 02|Aaah! That explains it. Penile compensation, as I see it.

Skellige Villager 03|Tell me, Bjorn, what do ye really want from life?
Skellige Villager 01|Me? From life? I just want some peace and quiet.
Skellige Villager 03|Don't tell me that vixen of yours is givin' you a hard time.
Skellige Villager 01|Hilda? No, not her. But her mother's over from Hindarsfjal…
Skellige Villager 01|What're you sniffin' at?
Skellige Villager 03|Me old lady claims I smell of the barn.
Skellige Villager 01|I don't smell nothin'.
Skellige Villager 03|Exactly! I knew it - she made the whole thing up!
Skellige Villager 01|Wenches, you know… But enough talkin', grab a fork. We've got manure to haul.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Villager 02|See the white-haired fellow? Seems dangerous, got wolven eyes or somethin'. Wonder what tide he drifted in on.
Skellige Villager 03|He's a Zerrikanian. Saw droves of his kind on a voyage south.
Skellige Villager 02|Zerrikania? That an island?
Skellige Villager 03|Skidi, see how little ye know of the world? But don't fret, you're safe with me.
Skellige Villager 02|Ogmund, ye heard the young an Craite sailed off to face the Ice Giant?
Skellige Villager 03|Aye, I heard. Even asked me to go with him, but I turned him down.
Skellige Villager 02|Why??
Skellige Villager 03|Who gives a holler about some giant? It's child's play - just right for a little shit like Hjalmar.
Skellige Villager 02|Hadn't realized ye knew him so well.
Skellige Woman 01|The young an Craite? He slapped Ogmund around at the tavern not long ago - that's how well he knows him.

Skellige Old Woman 01|Remember summer, three years back?
Skellige Old Man 01|A great many lads perished in the woods that year.
Skellige Old Woman 01|And then came a harsh winter and the Spirit showed our hunters where to find game.
Skellige Villager 02|Spirit showed 'em nothin'. They found the game themselves.
Skellige Old Man 01|Well, I heard the Spirit showed 'em. Put an end to the famine.
Skellige Old Man 01|Maybe the Spirit's killin' now 'cause hard times are ahead?
Skellige Old Woman 01|We should send a man to the jarl.
Skellige Villager 02|Hmph, Crach. Just what we need.
Skellige Woman 02|The woman speaks sense. The jarl will help.
Skellige Old Man 01|Say what you will about him, but the Spirit would talk to Crach.
Skellige Villager 02|Argh, shut your gobs before someone hears you.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Villager 05|This quiet worries me. It's the calm before the storm, I can feel it in me bones.
Skellige Villager 06|Ehh, Ole-Kristian, you're a poor soothsayer…
Skellige Villager 05|An interregnum means chaos. A chance for an Craite to oust us from Ard Skellig…
Skellige Villager 06|Our jarl's no spring chicken. He's more than a match for Crach in battle.
Skellige Villager 05|Quite the coincidence, I must say…
Skellige Villager 05|King Bran dies all of a sudden, then those bears… And next thing you know, Crach's preparin' for a coronation.
Skellige Villager 06|His son's.
Skellige Villager 06|Wait… are ye sayin' that they…?!
Skellige Villager 05|Not sayin' a thing. Just thinkin' aloud.
Skellige Villager 06|His daughter's.
Skellige Villager 05|It's a weight off me heart, lemme tell ye…
Skellige Villager 06|Your brother back from the raid?
Skellige Villager 05|He's back, back indeed. Tomorrow we sail to pay tribute to the new king.

Skellige Old Man 04|And 'midst Torgeir the Red's crew there was even… a warrior from the Continent!
Skellige Boy 03|Whoa! Really?
Skellige Old Man 04|Ye better believe it. Gerd was his name. Swifter in battle than a snow leopard!
Skellige Old Man 04|Scorned the axe, he did, severin' heads with two swords.
Skellige Old Man 04|Died at Castle Tuirseach when the Black Ones o'erran An Skellig.
Skellige Girl 03|Grandda, tell us another tale o' Gerd!
Skellige Old Man 04|They say he had a sword made o' moon steel. Or silver, don't rightly remember…
Skellige Old Man 04|He'd go off huntin' trolls, and they say sirens fled at the sight of 'im.
Skellige Old Man 04|He stuck true by the jarl. Lamentable the day when he breathed his last 'neath a pile of rubble…
Skellige Old Man 04|Stead o' dyin' in battle, as befits a warrior of his ilk!

Skellige Old Man 02|Twas Bran's forefather, Torgeir the Red, who sailed up the Alba to the gates of the Nilfgaardian capital… Set the city's outskirts alight.

Skellige Old Man 02|Just a shame he brought great misfortune on his folk by that deed…
Skellige Old Man 02|The emperor's vengeance was brutal.
Skellige Old Man 02|The sea turned black with Nilfgaard's sails. They landed on the isle… Hundreds of men. Thousands.
Skellige Old Man 02|They killed warriors, women, children… And when they were done, they tore every buildin' down. Stone by stone.
Skellige Villager 01|And what happened to Torgeir? Did he live?
Skellige Old Man 02|They took him captive. But the Black Ones didn't know the fiend they had…
Skellige Old Man 04|Durin' the crossin', he freed himself from his fetters, slew half their crew and threw himself into the sea!

Geralt|Once you'd left Yen and me on the Isle of Avalon, what happened to you? What did you do?
Cirilla|I traveled. Through time, space, different worlds… I saw houses of glass, ran with unicorns at the world's end, even lived in an undersea kingdom for a time.
Geralt|Hm… freedom. Always had a taste for it.
Cirilla|I still do.
Geralt|So why'd you return?
Cirilla|Ah, it was too much, I almost drowned in it. When everything is possible, it quickly becomes a lot less alluring.
Geralt|Traveling between worlds - what's it like?
Cirilla|It's… nice.
Geralt|Difficult?
Cirilla|It was at first. But in time it became… automatic - like riding a horse.
Geralt|Bet a lot of mages would love to learn to do it.
Cirilla|I'm certain they would… but Avallac'h claims they've neither the knowledge nor talent. He's spent four centuries learning to do it, yet can still only find and pass through preexisting portals.
Cirilla|I go wherever I please, whenever I please.
Geralt|The mark on my face - is it noticeable? Hard on the eyes?
Cirilla|Tsk… a bit. But you can't let it bother you.
Cirilla|You know, folk would stare at the scar on my cheek, always. It used to upset me greatly.
Geralt|And?
Cirilla|I started undoing one shirt button more. Problem solved.
Geralt|Not sure if you've heard, but… once it's all over, I'm going to Kovir.
Cirilla|With Triss.
Geralt|Mhm.
Cirilla|Interesting part of the world. Perhaps you'll get a contract for some rare snow beast. A barbegazi, or a vendigo… Or a, uh, an amarok.
Geralt|Or maybe I'll finally hang up my swords.
Cirilla|It's that good with her?
Geralt|Better.
Geralt|So… need your advice. About Yennefer.
Cirilla|Very well. Ask away.
Geralt|Thing is… I'd like to take her somewhere. Once it's over. Someplace… picturesque, beautiful, even. Where we can rest.
Geralt|You've been almost everywhere. Also know Yen well. Any ideas? I was thinking Spalla, or maybe Dol Blathanna…?
Cirilla|The first roadside inn you pass. Take her there. Pay for a month in advance, carve "Do not disturb" into the room door and shut it behind you.
Geralt|Huh. Just like that?
Cirilla|Just like that.
Geralt|Eredin's located you time and again. How's that work?
Cirilla|When I pass between worlds, I create a kind of shockwave. Anyone properly trained can sense it. That's how Avallac'h explains it, at any rate. He can do it, too.
Geralt|So you shouldn't actually ever use your power.
Cirilla|It's not like that. The impulse is stronger the longer my "voyage." On short hops, the disturbance is practically imperceptible.
Geralt|I should go.
Cirilla|All right, we'll talk later.
Geralt|Got a minute?
Cirilla|Of course.
Cirilla|I used to fear training on this.
Cirilla|Ergh, so many bruises…
<|endoftext|>
Cirilla|You call that a hit?!
Cirilla|Aaaa!
Cirilla|Don't make me laugh!
Cirilla|Sheathe it, before you hurt yourself.
Cirilla|Hah!
Cirilla|My nan hit harder than that!
Cirilla|Wrong, you louse!
Cirilla|Argh!
Cirilla|What do you say to this?!
Cirilla|Careful, or I'll cut you!
Cirilla|You'd not hit a woman, would you?
Cirilla|Wuss!
Cirilla|Stand down, or I will hurt you.
Cirilla|Yield and save me some time!
Cirilla|Hah! You're pathetic.
Cirilla|Back where you came from!
Cirilla|Well, come on.
Cirilla|Geralt?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Wanted to talk.
Geralt|Your daughter - first woman to rule Skellige.
Crach|She'll be a good queen. Knows what she wants.
Geralt|Yeah… so what does she want?
Crach|To unite all of Skellige's clans. A difficult task, no one has ever managed it, but Cerys is stubborn.
Geralt|Thinking long-term, then. Think she'll succeed?
Crach|She's got a powerful ally. In me.
Geralt|Son's King of Skellige. Congratulations to you.
Crach|Tis a great honor for the an Craite dynasty. First time one of ours sits on the throne.
Geralt|What kind of king will Hjalmar be?
Crach|One who sheds blood, praises courage and condemns cowardice.
Geralt|And unites the clans against Nilfgaard?
Crach|Of course. He's already decreed new longships be built.
Geralt|Any news of Hjalmar? His venture going well?
Crach|Hah! Tempted after all, eh? If you're itching to join him, it might not be too late.
Geralt|Hm, maybe I should visit Undvik…
Crach|Ask at the New Port. Clan Torrdaroch survivors lie around there. They refused to hunt the giant, but they're willing to talk.
Geralt|Sorry, remind me - where'd Cerys go?
Crach|Spikeroog. Got it in her head that she must help Udalryk.
Geralt|How?
Crach|I've the same question. He's a brave man, some say hot-tempered and hasty, but…
Crach|If Cerys wanted glory, she'd 'ave done better to sail with Hjalmar. As it is, who knows what ideas bat about in her head.
Geralt|War with Nilfgaard's already started from what I've seen.
Crach|We're ready for it.
Geralt|Nilfgaard's got a mighty fleet.
Crach|My children know how to deal with foes.
Geralt|You'll be hard pressed to defeat the imperial fleet.
Crach|We will conquer or perish. Hjalmar and Cerys showed us how to die like heroes.
Geralt|Can't say how sorry I am about your loss, jarl.
Crach|They died a good death.
Geralt|I found Ciri.
Crach|Hah! I knew you'd do it! Safe and sound, I trust?
Geralt|Yes. She was fleeing from the Wild Hunt.
Crach|Bring her to Kaer Trolde - she'll be safe here. And I must see how she's changed after all these years.
Geralt|The massacre during the feast - know anything new?
Crach|The inquest is ongoing. I'd rather not be hasty to condemn.
Crach|You and Hjalmar, you killed everyone who might've told us something.
Geralt|I know there're no witnesses, no evidence. But you must have suspects.
Crach|Daily I ask myself who has gained from this crime? The answer is simple: Svanrige.
Geralt|Think he's capable of such treachery?
Crach|If not him, then his mother.
Crach|Thanks to you and Cerys, we know who's responsible. It's enough for me.
Geralt|Not gonna try to capture the berserkers?
Crach|They were but tools, Wolf. I'd rather sever the hand that wields the sword than merely break steel.
Geralt|What's new in Skellige?
Crach|Of late, look seaward and you'll see their sun on a sail, starin' right back.
Crach|We've yet to capture any of their crew, but only a fool wouldn't know they're planning something.
Geralt|See you, Crach.
Crach|Ah, Geralt. You know I've always liked you, but now it feels like more… You helped my daughter.
Geralt|A friend's daughter asked me for help. Not in the habit of turning my back in those situations.
Crach|Telling you Geralt, since you and Hjalmar defeated the Ice Giant together, I see you as one of our own.
Geralt|I got the look of a Skelliger?
Crach|You've got the heart of an an Craite.

Verden Peasant 05|Hm, greetings.
Geralt|Wouldn't mind a drink. Show me what you got.
Geralt|Bloody Baron - how'd he get that moniker? There a story to it?
Verden Peasant 05|A time ago, when he was still in the army, some Black 'uns had holed up in a dye works. Baron and his men were ordered to take it. Others might've bided their time, starved 'em out, but the baron's an hasty one, attacked straightaway.
Verden Peasant 05|The Black 'uns surrendered. Baron and his men took most of 'em alive. But one of his blokes knocked over a vat of red dye. It all ran into the river.
Verden Peasant 05|Folk took to sayin' that the river'd flowed red with blood, er, that the baron had slaughtered his prisoners to a man. Been known as the Bloody Baron ever since.
Geralt|Kind of ironic.
Verden Peasant 05|Well, a week before, he'd massacred a whole squadron in Ingholm. But far fewer heard that story.
Geralt|Baron's not from around here, right?
Verden Peasant 05|He's Temerian, but from other parts. Folk say he deserted along with his company. Showed up here one day with his stragglers. They'd all had enough of the wanderin'.
Verden Peasant 05|So they took the old lord's castle, and the baron became master of Crow's Perch.
Verden Peasant 05|Reckon once the Black 'uns feel sure they hold the land, they'll let 'im keep Crow's Perch, give 'im a true title.
Geralt|Thanks, Farewell.

Geralt|Gotta tell me - how'd you wind up owning this… establishment?
Dandelion|Hahahah! You'll never believe this! I inherited it - from none other than Alonso Wily, Whoreson Senior himself.
Geralt|You're right - I don't believe it.
Dandelion|Alonso ruled the local underworld with an iron fist. But deep down he was a romantic, pure as they come…
Dandelion|This place is one of the reasons his son's not my biggest fan. See, Cyprian - Junior, that is - wanted to make this a brothel, but the Rosemary went to me.
Dandelion|And I plan to turn it into the most elegant venue in town. A den of art and culture.
Geralt|How'd you and Priscilla meet?
Dandelion|Hmm… It was at the court of Duke Hereward - the Annual Balladry Contest. We faced off in the final.
Geralt|Who won?
Dandelion|I don't remember.
Geralt|I bet. Probably lost and you don't wanna admit it.
Dandelion|Actually, she'd caught my eye, so I let her win. I was counting on getting a prize after the contest.
Geralt|And? Did you?
Dandelion|Hah. That, my friend, is not your concern.
Geralt|Found your ring, Here.
Dandelion|Hah! Thanks so much! Thought I'd lost it.
Dandelion|Got it from Priscilla, you know.
Geralt|Nice gift.
Dandelion|She swore it had always brought her luck. Of course, I landed in that dungeon soon after she gave it to me. Oh well.
Geralt|Got a portrait of Hierarch Hemmelfart I'm willing to part with. Want it?
Dandelion|Yes! Those halfling painters - this one of theirs?
Geralt|Uh, mhm.
Dandelion|Wonderful. I put this up at the Rosemary and Thyme, it'll make those Temple Guard inspections so much easier.
Geralt|Ran into Molly. She says "hello."
Dandelion|Molly? Which Molly?
Geralt|One you promised to show your butterfly collection to.
Dandelion|Ah, yes… Now I remember.
Geralt|Butterfly collection? You of all people could stand to be a little more inventive.
Dandelion|Molly didn't need inventive, she needed attentive. Average, run of the mill girl… but give her a smile, notice her shoes, let her chat about them a bit, and she'd turn into a wellspring of passion.
Geralt|See you, Dandelion.
Geralt|Dandelion…
Dandelion|Around me thundered the noise of the street. In mourning, an image of majestic distress. With dainty fingers lifting the hem of her dress. A stately woman strode by with hurrying feet.
Geralt|Ugh. Dandelion. Hey! Hear me?
Dandelion|Geralt, I'm writing, creating. Incidentally, what do you think of that bit?
Geralt|Verbose drivel. Simple as that. Need to talk to you, Dandelion - in prose.
Dandelion|Ugh. Witchers - not an ounce of sensitivity.
Dandelion|Now, what's eating you?
Geralt|Could almost swear I've heard it before.
Dandelion|Really? Doesn't seem familiar to me… But, it's only a first draft, needs a lot of revision, lemme tell you.
Geralt|Wonderful, best you've every written. Now can we talk?
Dandelion|Well… honestly never expected my art could move the hardened heart of a witcher.
Geralt|Got a minute?
Dandelion|For you, my friend - always!
<|endoftext|>
Anna Henrietta|Yes, Geralt?
Geralt|Wanted to talk. That is, if it's no bother, Your Grace.
Anna Henrietta|Why ever would it be? I'm listening, what is it?
Geralt|Don't mean to pry, Your Grace, but… curious how you met Dandelion. Mind telling me about it?
Geralt|So long as it's not a sensitive subject, that is.
Anna Henrietta|Oh, ancient history… My father announced a grand tourney. Julian was invited. He was to compose a song about a valorous struggle in the arena.
Anna Henrietta|What he wrote was the most beautiful love ballad I had ever heard. Haha. Papa was furious, refused to pay him.
Geralt|Ballad - about you?
Anna Henrietta|Not overtly. I was married to Raymund at the time, after all.
Geralt|Hmm. I get it.
Geralt|This tourney - quite a dose of pomp and circumstance.
Anna Henrietta|We cherish this tradition. My great-grandmama, Adela Marta, elevated it to its current status… For the longest time, she could not decide whom to wed. Meanwhile, her suitors, and there were swarms, often dueled one another.
Anna Henrietta|In their contests Ademarta saw an altogether comfortable way of picking the prime apple from the bushel of potential husbands, determining who had what she valued most in men - strength, valor and cunning.
Anna Henrietta|Thus she commanded them to take part in tourneys. Though in the end she chose none of them and wed instead the youngest son of Nilfgaard's reigning emperor, whom she met on a journey south.
Geralt|But Beauclair's inhabitants had begun to enjoy the knights' sparring?
Anna Henrietta|Very much so! And not only they. The year after, knights from far and wide gathered to face one another for sport and glory. And so it has remained. Though the prize has changed - the duchess' hand and half the duchy are no longer in the offing…
Anna Henrietta|Still, Beauclair's tourneys are famed the world over. Of that we are rather proud.
Geralt|Can't help but wonder how Toussaint manages to stay out of every war. Nilfgaard's next door, yet it never comes to so much as a minor border skirmish. Not to mention a full-fledged invasion.
Anna Henrietta|Our knights guard our borders. And my cousin, Emperor Emhyr var Emreis, assured me Toussaint would remain neutral and has kept his promise.
Anna Henrietta|I have oft tried to prevail upon him, in no uncertain terms, to tame his belligerence once and for all. Sadly, he has not heeded my pleas. To the world's great sorrow, I fear.
Geralt|Sorrow indeed, Your Grace.
Geralt|Thanks for sparing the time, Your Grace.
Anna Henrietta|Duty calls?
Geralt|You got it.
Anna Henrietta|I understand. Understand and approve.
Anna Henrietta|What is it?
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Boy 01|Heartfelt greetings, sir. Allow me to say you look wonderful, almost. Figure - trim… a stunning ensemble…
Toussaint Boy 01|But your feet… Those feet could stand to look better.
Toussaint Boy 01|As it happens, I'm a bootblack. Though the name's ill-fitting, for in truth I am a foot beautifier.
Geralt|And a smooth talker, that's clear.
Toussaint Boy 01|Could be, probably am. But in my trade, the clumsy-tongued go nowhere. Besides, I speak a lot, but every word's the truth. For example - I'm the most professional professional in all Toussaint. See?
Geralt|Sure, I see…
Toussaint Boy 01|I do hope you'll grace me with your custom. I need coppers in heaps to buy herbs for my sick father. He suffers terribly, the poor man.
Geralt|Get many customers?
Toussaint Boy 01|Droves and loads!
Toussaint Boy 01|Though I expect to have more. My trade always booms when the tourneys are on.
Geralt|Knights' boots get dirtier then?
Toussaint Boy 01|It's not just the boots. When they fight, they soil all. I shine their armor, helmets, belts, sheathes… They like them shiny as a dog's danglers.
Toussaint Boy 01|Oh… pardon.
Geralt|You're pretty chatty, nosy…
Toussaint Boy 01|I would say inquisitive and sociable. Besides, a good tradesman ought to amuse his clients with small talk.
Geralt|Fair enough. Must know a lot about the folk of Beauclair.
Toussaint Boy 01|All about all, meaning everything about everyone. I know who slept with who, and who wishes they had. I know who's friends, and who'd slit each other's throats.
Geralt|Potentially dangerous, that kind of knowledge.
Toussaint Boy 01|Bah. But I'm known to keep my tongue tied, my mouth sealed tight. Why if I blabbed what I hear, they'd have done me in long past. As it is, all that's said on my stand, stays on my stand.
Geralt|Take care, now.
Toussaint Boy 01|Come early, come often. I'll perfect your look. And not only yours, but every man's, woman's, child's.
Toussaint Boy 01|Greetings, Sir Witcher. You've a generous heart. Surely you'll give custom - and perhaps spare a tip - to a poor lad working to support his sick mum?
Geralt|Last time I came by, your father was sick.
Toussaint Boy 01|For he was. But he got better. Now mum's taken ill, but she'll get better, too, once I've earned a bit of coin for her herbs.
Geralt|Hey there.
Toussaint Boy 01|Greetings, guardian witcher. Thanks to you, my little enterprise is in ruddy health.
Geralt|Can't really see that anything's changed.
Toussaint Boy 01|All in due time. At the moment I'm perusing my options. Asking after prices, verifying quality. You know it's very easy to squander coin. But rest assured, I will spend mine very wisely.
Geralt|My, my… if you're like this now, who'll you be when you're older?
Toussaint Boy 01|A very rich man.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Might actually take a while - she hadn't eaten anything in over a hundred years when I found her…
Butler|Horrid… whatever brought this about?
Geralt|Told me her story on the way here.
Geralt|Her name's Marlene. She was once the very beautiful and proud heiress to the Trastamara estate.
Geralt|One evening, when she was holding a banquet for friends, a beggar came to her gate seeking alms. He had a bowl and a spoon with him. He sat outside her fence and waited.
Butler|I've heard of the custom - an ancient right of hospitality that obliges one to give food and drink to such a guest lest he depart hungry. To neglect the custom is to bring great misfortune down upon oneself.
Geralt|Marlene didn't care a whit for the old customs. She drove the man off, saying she'd rather feed the leftovers from her feast to her dogs than to give the beggar anything.
Geralt|The beggar then broke his spoon, cast a curse. She was beautiful, so he said she'd never wish to look at herself in the mirror again.
Geralt|Since she adored feasts, he swore no one would ever wish to sit and dine with her.
Geralt|And as she even refused him the crumbs from her table, he swore she'd never find a spoon in the world that would sate her hunger.
Butler|A harsh punishment… I imagine lifting the curse was hardly simple…
Geralt|Curses are tricky, they play on irony. Always gotta figure out what the catch is.
Geralt|Marlene had spent decades looking for a way to lift it. Transformed into a wight, she stole spoons and lured folk into her home, trying each time to get them to dine with her. Didn't work.
Butler|So what did?
Geralt|Someone had to sit down and share a meal with her - of their own free will. They had to eat without using spoons and make her look at her reflection.
Butler|That's it? That was all it required?
Geralt|Simplest solutions are sometimes the last that come to mind.
Geralt|Besides, when you're a wight, it's pretty damn hard to find willing human company for a feast.
Butler|I imagine so… But most importantly it is now over. Please don't worry, she will be in good hands here.
Geralt|Mentioned the place could stand to be spruced up…
Butler|Oh, most decidedly, sir! The question is where you would like to begin this rejuvenation.
Geralt|Been thinking about the outer walls… maybe a fresh coat of paint, or some patching?
Butler|If I might dare to make a suggestion - why not start with a general renovation? I once oversaw such work at Admiral Rompally's summer residence. The effects were simply breathtaking!
Butler|Not only did the residence positively sparkle afterwards, but we also made room to display the admiral's armor and weapons, of which he was a passionate collector.
Geralt|It's in your hands, then. Make the place shine.
Butler|I shall get to work immediately. Within a day's passing I shall have sent for the crew which rebuffed the admiral's residence. They are the finest specialists around.
Butler|Highly skilled at what they do, it shall not take them too long, I wager. Two days after they begin your eyes will behold your residence in its refurbished, rejuvenated, beautified state.
Butler|Is there anything, anything else you require, sir?
Geralt|Thinking about buying a comfortable bed. Always wanted one…
Butler|Excellent idea! In your profession, rest is supremely important. But say the word and I shall order you a bed from the carpenters who craft comfort for the court.
Geralt|Great, order me a fine bed, please. Think I deserve one at my age…
Butler|True indeed, true indeed, I shall send a runner at once. The bed will be in place by this time tomorrow.
Geralt|Hmm… need to think it over some.
Butler|I understand, of course. As the venerable Lady Eeve Kniebihly would so quaintly put it - the rash oft contract rashes.
Geralt|Could use another weapon rack. Got some interesting pieces I'd like to display.
Butler|I know of a carpentry shop in town which crafts the humblest lumber into true masterpieces. You need but give the word.
Geralt|Fine, order the racks.
Butler|Of course, at once. At most one day for them to arrive, is my estimation.
Geralt|Along the Path, I've often picked up well crafted, beautifully ornamented armor. Some of those pieces would look great on display here.
Butler|I agree, it would lend the place a certain witchers' air. Shall I order new stands at once, sir?
Geralt|Yes, just please make sure they're solidly made… and nicely finished.
Butler|It goes without saying, sir. There is nothing worse than splendid armor upon a subpar stand.
Butler|By this time tomorrow, they shall be ready to display your finest finds.
Geralt|Was wondering about the guest room. Not that I'm expecting company, but…
Butler|Oh, but that is immaterial! All self-respecting homes should boast a comfortable guest room. What if someone were to drop by unannounced?
Geralt|Yeah, sooner we start on that, the better.
Butler|I can tell a man of action immediately. I'll see to it myself. The room shall be ready in two days, in my opinion.
Geralt|If you don't mind, I'd rather postpone talking about renovations. Need to ask you something else.
Butler|Of course, sir, as you wish. What is the nature of your inquiry?
Geralt|Let's put a pin in this for now. Remembered I have some urgent business to tend to.
Butler|Not the slightest problem, sir. I am here to serve whenever you desire.
Geralt|Feels like by investing a bit of coin, I could make the house more functional.
Butler|I agree, yet I would urge you to hold off on further construction until the ongoing work is done. Juggling can be a challenging art. It's best not to undertake too much at once.
Butler|With the utmost respect, sir, the vineyard has arrived at the pinnacle of perfection. Any further changes could prove a regrettable step down the slope towards the brash. I firmly advise against it.
Butler|I agree thoroughly. With every fiber of my being.
Butler|Indeed, momentum is best maintained once established. Now that we've finished the general renovations, you might begin to consider such things as a new bed or additional armor stands or weapon racks. Also, some new furnishings and a fresh coat of paint on the walls would do much to improve the guest quarters.
Geralt|Got these spacious grounds… Hmmm, but maybe it's time to make them more, umm… useful.
Butler|Oh, yes, we certainly should!
Butler|Hmm… Provided we preserve the grounds' Beauclairois stylings, and on condition you are not considering something like, oh, digging vast holes in which to store monster carcasses or bury cursed treasure, I am very much in favor, sir.
Geralt|My armor needs work from time to time - you know, oil this, reinforce that… Could use a decent work table where I could do all that.
Butler|Admiral Rompally once hired a specialist who made the finest armorer's tables this side of the Yaruga. I will contact him at once.
Geralt|Good. Order me up a table like that.
Butler|Immediately, sir. I expect it will take at most one day to arrive.
Butler|Will you be needing anything else, sir?
Geralt|Hmm… know what? Might not be the best time to lay out that kind of coin. Lemme sleep on it.
Butler|Ponder the notion however long you wish, sir. I am at your disposal always.
Geralt|In my trade, my blades get dull pretty quick. Could use a grindstone, professional-grade .
Butler|Of course. No one will consider that an unnecessary extravagance, I would wager.
Geralt|Then send out for one, please. A high-quality stone to be set up in the yard.
Butler|Of course, I shall send a runner to town at once. I believe you shall be grinding to your heart's content by… tomorrow.
Geralt|You know Roach, my horse… Well, we've been through a lot together. And since I've finally got a decent place to stay, think she deserves one, too.
Butler|Ooh, a sturdy stable testifies to a most honorable owner! Just say the word and I'll have them start working on it at once.
Geralt|My Roach deserves the best. Have them refurbish the stables.
Butler|I shall get to work at once. Yet finding workmen and completing construction takes time, though likely no more than two days…
Geralt|So, sometimes I have to brew a potion, but I can't find the herbs I need growing anywhere nearby…
Butler|Well, you're in luck, sir! The flower garden once kept by Madame Nina, Monsieur Bolius' wife, seems the ideal place to cultivate herbs! In fact, it's roomy enough to plant shrubbery!
Geralt|Good idea, Barnabas-Basil. Herbs there will save me hours of painstaking searching and harvesting.
Butler|The idea is yours, sir, I am but the humble executor of your will. I believe we shall have sewn the first seeds in two days' time.
Butler|But of course, and have you anything specific in mind, sir?
Butler|What a splendidly wise idea! Now that the general refurbishment is done, why not see to the grounds? Perhaps renovate the stables, or return Madame Bolius' garden to its former verdancy?
Butler|The way I see things, given your trade, sir, you would be wise to put in a grindstone and an armorer's table. A good way to start things off, don't you think?
Butler|With the general refurbishment now done, I would advise you consider breathing new life into the stable and the garden.
Geralt|Starting to get into this whole renovating thing. There must be other things we can improve.
Geralt|Know what? Changed my mind. Not in the mood to talk about redecoration today. But I wanted to ask you something else.
Butler|I shall be glad to answer your every question, sir.
Geralt|That's all for now, B.B. Thanks.
Geralt|Starting to really like this place. Maybe we should keep going, refurbish some more? What do you think, B.B.?
Butler|As you wish, sir. Shall we see to the house or the grounds this time?
Geralt|Been thinking about the, uh, renovations we could do…
Butler|In light of the current situation in Beauclair, I fear we must postpone any additional work you might wish to initiate…
Geralt|Right, got vampires in town to tend to. Thanks for reminding me.
Geralt|Vineyard comes across as a place with a rich history. Know who owned it before me?
Butler|Baron Rossell, who went bankrupt, forcing him to sell the estate to the duchess. The baron, in turn, had purchased it from Monsieur Bolius of the Headsmen… A truly colorful man, of Kaedweni origin.
Geralt|He was actually a headsman?
Butler|No, not him, but his great-great-great-great-grandfather? Indeed. Apparently, he was a common cutpurse who somehow secured for himself the post of ducal headsman in Beauclair. Went about his work with an exceptional penchant. They say he chopped off more heads than there are grapevines in the ducal vineyards.
Butler|He never hesitated, not once, never sliced unevenly, never botched a job. For his exemplary service, the duke granted him a title and this estate.
Butler|Monsieur Bolius, on the other hand, was an engineer in his younger years. Once retired, he settled here and took to producing wine.
Butler|Sadly, misfortune struck and he lost his sense first of smell, then of taste. Additionally, he could not drink alcohol - his medic forbade it.
Geralt|Shame, that. He give up making wine?
Butler|Not at all! He made even more of it! Began throwing wild balls to which he'd invite friends from far and wide, in order to treat them to his wine and delight in the fact that at least someone could enjoy it. It's the sort of man he was, Monsieur Bolius.
Geralt|Mind giving me a little tour de Corvo Bianco?
Butler|Not in the least. Follow me, please. I think it would be practical to begin on the hill.
Geralt|Ever play gwent, B. B.?
Butler|Funny you should ask, sir. I was quite adept in my younger years. But that was so long ago… I fear I've limited my interest to collecting, now. Managed to assemble quite the set of decks.
Geralt|Huh. Sounds interesting. Mind showing me what you got?
Butler|Not at all, sir, but only in action. A round or two, perhaps?
Geralt|May the best man win.
Butler|Do you wish to play against any particular faction, sir?
Geralt|Play as the Northern Realms, will you?
Butler|As you wish. Would you prefer I use my strongest deck or a weaker one?
Geralt|Feeling lucky today. Use your strongest.
Butler|At your service, sir. Well then - let us play.
Geralt|Hmm… maybe a… moderately strong deck? That should be fair.
Geralt|Weakest. You mind?.
Geralt|Yeah. You be Nilfgaard.
Geralt|Scoia'tael. Sound all right?
Geralt|I'm a witcher, so Monsters.
Geralt|Skellige seems most appropriate for you.
Geralt|Not really. You choose.
Geralt|Maybe later. Got something I need to do right now.
Butler|As you wish, sir.
Geralt|Up for a few rounds of gwent, B.B.?
Butler|Oh, with great pleasure, sir. Ready?
Geralt|Asked about our guest earlier. Sorry, I was busy with my hunt, didn't have time to answer…
Butler|When one gazes at that unfortunate creature, the question "what ever happened here" asks itself…
Geralt|It's all over, that's what matters. Let's now focus on taking care of Marlene.
Butler|Naturally. I shall see to it.
Geralt|Thanks. Gotta get back to my business now. See you soon.
Butler|No worries, sir. I shall see to everything. She is safe here and in good hands. She'll soon be back on her feet.
Geralt|So I took her by the hand and led her here. Seemed the only sensible place for her.
Butler|You did the right thing, sir. She should recover quickly here.
Butler|I'm deeply pleased finally to make your acquaintance, sir, though I do regret the specific circumstances. In all the commotion I fear I neglected to introduce myself. I'm Barnabas-Basil Foulty and by order of the duchess, I am to serve you as majordomo at Corvo Bianco.
Geralt|Nice to meet you, Barnabas-Basil. Love to talk more, but got urgent matters to attend to. While I'm gone, please make sure she gets everything she needs.
Butler|I previously served with distinction at the Kniebihly family manor and in Nazair with Admiral Rompally, who, as you are certain to know, is an extraordinary demanding gentleman…
Geralt|Whoa, Barnabas-Basil. One thing you oughta know - I'm not your typical landed gentleman. Truth be told, this is the first real property I've ever owned…
Butler|Ooh, in that case, you must leave it all to me! I shall organize, see to everything and whip the house into order. I daresay this place will soon be the most prosperous vineyard around!
Geralt|Great, can already see I'm in good hands.
Butler|Prior to undertaking anything in that regard, sir, I feel I should inform you that someone has been awaiting you arrival.
Geralt|Who might that be?
Butler|You must forgive me. I do not know, alas. Your guest failed to give a name.
Butler|One last request before you go in to see them - please come and find me afterwards. I have yet to give you a tour of the estate.
Butler|How might I be of service, sir?
Butler|Wonderfully! The furnishings you last had me order have arrived.
Butler|Very well indeed, sir. At this rate Corvo Bianco will soon be restored to its former glory.
Butler|You ought to be the final judge of that, sir. Yet in my humble opinion, they are progressing splendidly. The laborers have completed all the general renovations. Also, the furnishings you had me order have arrived.
Butler|I am delighted to inform you we have completed our labors. You can now devote yourself to enjoying the vineyard's delights to the fullest.
Butler|You must forgive me my temerity, sir, but I thought, with all the work on Corvo Bianco completed, and with the estate looking more beautiful than ever, it might be appropriate to commemorate the moment…
Geralt|Sure, why not.
Butler|During the tidying that preceded the renovations, I came across a bottle of Sepremento, the 1250 vintage. I cannot say by what miracle it survived, but it is here. And we've cause to open it today.
Butler|… and then he ran straight into the crowd, burning bouquet in hand. All thought it a part of the performance, so they only laughed - even when the décor began to catch fire.
Butler|It was not until the flames engulfed Baron Marhevkin's beard that folk began to realize something was amiss and went to put out the fires.
Geralt|Hahaha, sounds like Monsieur Bolius and Madame Nina threw some first-rate balls here…
Butler|It was so. In this regard, Baron Rossell was decidedly more reserved.
Geralt|So tell me, Barnabas-Basil, what's the wine situation like here? Am I gonna produce any this year?
Butler|This year is out, I fear, sir. Last autumn a fungus destroyed all the vines. Baron Rossell had new ones planted, but it will be some time before they start bearing fruit. Assuming, that is, the fungus does not reappear.
Geralt|Mhh, that'd be bad. This Sepremento got me dreaming - it's amazing…
Butler|Isn't it, though? Allow me to top you off, sir… There…
Geralt|Thanks.
Geralt|Thanks, B.B., but I'm afraid duty calls. Won't mind if you wanna have a drink, though.
Butler|Why no, sir, I wouldn't dare…
Geralt|Wouldn't worry about it. I'm not really one for celebrations, but I'm serious - go ahead, knock one back. You've earned it.
Butler|Very well, sir. If you insist. I thank you.
Geralt|Renovations coming along all right?
Geralt|Renovations coming along all right, Barnabas-Basil?
Butler|Superbly, sir! General refurbishment has been completed, and I took the liberty of adding two racks each upon which you might hang weapons and armor, if you've some pieces you'd like to display. Likewise, I have prepared a few spots in which new paintings might be hung.
Butler|In other news, the laborers dusting out the cellar have made a most unusual discovery… I believe it's something you'll wish to see.
Geralt|If you say I should see it, I'll go see it right now, B.B.
Geralt|Fine, but maybe later. Something I'd like to ask you right now.
Butler|I am all ears.
Geralt|You mean the lab in the cellar? Saw it. So, one of the previous owners interested in alchemy?
Butler|A laboratory? Alchemy? I know nothing of it. But I understand that to a witcher this must be a very intriguing find.
Geralt|It is. It was walled up. Equipment's pretty ancient, too, so it must've belonged to someone who lived at Corvo Bianco before you started working here.
Geralt|Whoever it was sure knew their stuff, though. Got dragon glass vials and flasks, stills, sublimators, vengerometers…
Butler|Forgive me, sir, but I fear I don't follow.
Geralt|Just saying it's top-notch equipment, true masterpieces of craftsmanship for use in alchemy. Brewing a concoction with this stuff versus doing it over an open fire - well, there's no comparison.
Butler|Then I am all the more delighted you discovered it, sir.
Butler|Behold, sir, your estate, in all its splendor.
Geralt|Pretty vast…
Butler|Indeed. And now, sir, allow me to show you a handful of interesting details. Follow me, please.
Butler|A pleasure to welcome you once again to the as yet humble confines of Corvo Bianco. When last we met, I did not get the opportunity to present my credentials. With your permission, I shall do so now.
Butler|Welcome home, sir. I am Barnabas-Basil Foulty. By order of the duchess, I shall serve you as majordomo of Corvo Bianco.
Geralt|B. B., know anything about the laboratory in the cellar? One of the previous owners take an interest in alchemy?
Butler|On the left is the master bedroom. On the right, the dining hall and kitchen. Upstairs you shall find the guest room, currently used for storage.
Geralt|Not a bad idea.
Butler|At the moment, the house is only minimally furnished, yet I believe we will, together, devise some innovative arrangements. A few paintings, for instance, would breathe new life into the abode immediately.
Butler|With that, sir, you've seen the full lay of the land… Corvo Bianco is a beautiful estate, though one must admit time has taken its toll.
Butler|If… forgive me for being forward, but if you were to choose to invest a small sum towards its beautification, consider me at your service on the matter.
Geralt|Think I'll take you up on that. Be sure to come and see you if I decide to do any remodeling.
Butler|This time I won. Would you be interested in a rematch, sir?
Butler|I congratulate you on your victory. Shall we continue playing?
Butler|Greetings, sir. I am Barnabas-Basil Foulty. By order of our dearly departed duchess, I shall serve you as majordomo of Corvo Bianco.
Butler|Sir, we received a shipment of wine. From the Belgaard Vineyard, I believe, with kind regards from Madame Matilda and Monsieur Liam.
Butler|I had the barrels unloaded and stored in the cellar, to the right of the entrance.
Geralt|Thanks. Take a look when I have a moment.
Butler|Splendid. I was told to expect a subsequent delivery five days hence.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Fine. I'll look into it. Might be a botched portal, but I doubt it.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Lebioda reward you with progeny aplenty. I shall keep an eye out for your return.
Geralt|They vanished? What's that mean?
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Just that, along with ample supplies. I had placed an order. More than a dozen wagons reached the building site, yet five were lost along the way.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Tools, food, building materials and, first and foremost, the specailists we need, the chief architect included.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|I wrote to the architect to say the quarry awaits, he should send new plans. But the foreman said the architect was here, at Ardaiso. And this means…
Geralt|He's missing too. Got it. I'll look around, see what I can learn.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Master, I know not how to thank you. But I beg you to hurry. We shall simply not finish without those five wagons.
Geralt|Need to know more about this accident. Anyone actually see what happened?
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|No, but sounds there were. Austerve had just gone to see how Emil was getting along when suddenly we heard an ear-botching boom. Moments later, something smashed into one of the cranes.
Geralt|Doubt it was the cow that hit the crane.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Probably true. At any rate, come morn we ventured out to see, but the vermin drove us off. With that, all work came to a halt, has remained so since.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Master, tarry no longer, please. Will you take on the matter?
Geralt|What exactly's going on here?
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Construction of a statue of the Prophet Lebioda. We're carving it. Not all at once, that is, but piece by piece. A pious investor's revived the project after years of neglect. He's engaged all nearby quarries in its completion.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|And we would be on schedule were it not for the incident! Please, master… will you look into it?
Geralt|Need to talk about my reward before I decide.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Ahh, time for a good haggle. So, how much would you take?
Geralt|Yeah. You can get back to work. And it wasn't a plague of falling cows.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Did I not say so from the start? A weight off my chest! So what was behind the animal's plummet?
Geralt|Young slyzard flying over the quarry dropped it. Was trying to get it back to its nest - food for its mother and siblings.
Geralt|Beasts shouldn't cause you any more trouble.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Why, that is grand news!
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Here, take this. And I thank you, master!
Geralt|Probably heard the last of the beasts. Burned the nest, eggs, everything.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|A praiseworthy precaution, but as I said, I can only pay you what we agreed. I simply haven't any more.
Geralt|Talk some other time, maybe. So long.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Yes, an unfortunate matter, indeed, to be crushed by a cow… A true shame, Emil - he was a good worker.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|I told them at once there had to be a simple explanation. But that lot, no - right away they started in screaming "plague," demanding higher wages for "hardship," "poor working conditions," you see…? They'll ruin me, the blotters.
Geralt|Mh. My job… is to figure out why a cow fell from the sky? That it?
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|That, too. The thing is, since none bothered to clear the cow corpse, some filth's overrun the other pit. We fear to venture there.
Geralt|Not surprised. Cow - where'd it come from, what kind was it?
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Why, the ordinary spotted kind. Nothing unusual. Its corpse rots in the other pit, sends out its stench. And Emil lies right beneath it. Will you tend to the matter, take on the contract?
Geralt|Necrophages, I know. Already tended to them. Saw the cow and Emil, too, but I need to take a closer look.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Yes, master, that you must. This riddle needs unraveling.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Zoot, we must get back to work soon, immediately, or our plan's worth a dog's runny turd.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Well? Have you learned how that cow came to fly?
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|You're back? Here to clear up the mystery of the cow after all?
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|What? You jest! We mine stone here, not gold!
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Hm, you must go lower for it to make any sense to me.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Fine. But that is the sum total - no bonuses or gratuities on top, understood?
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|No chance! You shall have what I offer or get out of my sight.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|We're to miss yet another milestone…? How am I to tell the investor?
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Master, what would I have done without you? Countless throngs of Lebioda's followers will praise in prayer.
Geralt|And you'll pay me, right?
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|But of course, your reward. The investor is a serious man of enterprise. Our plan foresee mass conversions. With the donations that will follow, we aim to recoup the costs of production in three to five years. Everything has been calculated, you see, down to the last decimal.
Geralt|Hm, good luck, then. Farewell.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Ah, master, the matter of the statue…? How fare things?
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|So, master, the workers who vanished - how goes the search?
Geralt|Helped you finish the statue like you asked.
<|endoftext|>
Regis|Geralt… I'd never wish to give the impression I do not enjoy your company - the truth is quite the opposite, in fact - however…
Geralt|Yeah, I know. Dettlaff's not likely to show up long as I'm here. But five minutes won't save us, will it?
Regis|I suppose not. I was wrong to press you to go. You wished to ask something…?
Geralt|Been meaning to ask you… how'd you and Dettlaff meet?
Regis|Hm, hm. A somewhat… uncomfortable subject.
Geralt|I'm all ears and I got time.
Regis|As you well know, during my teething years I had a… spell… during which I abused blood. Among vampiric youth I was, all false modesty aside, rather popular. I ran with the plasma crowd. I made a great many acquaintances… one of whom was Dettlaff.
Regis|But… our paths soon diverged. You see, our band had an appetite for chasing youthful capers. Blood-guzzling contests, that sort of thing - "let's turn into bats and terrify the ladies." Dettlaff thought it all foolish. He was right, of course… though I only came to understand this later.
Geralt|Sorry… just can't imagine you as a young vampire rabble-rouser, renegade, punk.
Regis|You know of our exceedingly long lifespans… They allow us plenty of time to change. I, for one, thank the gods for that.
Geralt|Just wondering… what if Dettlaff doesn't show?
Regis|He'll show.
Geralt|Ugh… Tell me, how's this work? When I need a short answer, concise, quick, you're likely to give me a scholarly lecture. But when I could use some details, elaboration, all's I get is a few grunts. What's that about?
Regis|Allow me to explain. When speaking of facts, tangible matters, I do indeed strive to express myself precisely and at length.
Regis|However, when our discussions center on affairs of the intuition or things vampiric, my utterances are indeed towards the taciturn. For even the longest discourse would not allow me to explain to my interlocutor any issue of this purview satisfactorily.
Regis|Therefore, I repeat - Dettlaff will show. Sooner or later.
Regis|But while we're at it, be so good and explain to me how it was you acquired that startling scar on your face. Forgive me for being direct, but it's tormented me for some time, now.
Geralt|Ugh, long story, actually. Let's just say I struck up with some unsavory folk. No worries, though. I'll get out of it.
Geralt|Take care, Regis.
Regis|Yes, Geralt?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Managed to find five sets in all.
Slavko Atimstein|Incredible! Simply absurd! Five sets?! I beg you, do tell me what you've learned.
Geralt|Scraps, for the most part, but fine - tell me what you know. I'll fill in any blanks I can.
Geralt|All these diagrams somehow wound up in Toussaint. How was that even possible?
Slavko Atimstein|Toussaint was once home to Tyen'sail, a legendary and now deceased elven master armorer. Witchers from all corners of the world came to him to forge their plate, their mail.
Geralt|Heard about him - supposed to have been the best.
Slavko Atimstein|And thus he charged a king's ransom for his work. Witchers would take difficult, dangerous work to earn the coin to pay him. Some, alas, met with misfortune, and the diagrams they carried were left to rot with their earthly remains.
Geralt|Got it - find them, find the diagrams. But how can I know where to look for their remains?
Slavko Atimstein|As it happens, I learned my trade at Tyen'sail's side. So I heard the stories of the missing witchers first-hand.
Slavko Atimstein|What he told me… well, that is what discouraged me from seeking the diagrams out myself.
Slavko Atimstein|We must strike a deal. I shall tell you all I know. In return, once you've found the diagrams, you will let me draft a copy.
Slavko Atimstein|We must strike a deal. I shall tell you all I know of the remaining diagrams. In return, once you've found them, you will let me draft a copy.
Geralt|Where do I look for these diagrams?
Slavko Atimstein|I know of five likely fallen witchers, each from a different school - of the Wolf, Griffin, Cat, Bear and Manticore. Which should I start with?
Geralt|Tell me about my brother, the Wolf.
Slavko Atimstein|His name was Adon. I remember him well. My master liked him, helped him find a safe yet well-paid contract.
Slavko Atimstein|A few years ago, an archaeological expedition arrived in Toussaint from Castel Graupian. They questioned my master about the elven ruins at Termes. He warned them of the danger there and recommended they take Adon as an escort.
Geralt|What kind of danger did he mean? Any idea?
Slavko Atimstein|Legend claims wraiths haunt the chambers beneath Termes. I cannot say if there is any truth to this, but both the scholars and the witcher disappeared without a trace.
Slavko Atimstein|I do not know how to thank you.
Slavko Atimstein|At last, I stand a chance of producing something exceptional, a chance of proving I am no worse than my master. Your reward, witcher - and I await your order.
Geralt|I'll probably learn what happened by the time I find the rest of the diagrams.
Geralt|Guess I got lucky. Managed to find all the diagrams.
Geralt|The Griffin - what can you tell me about him?
Slavko Atimstein|He came some two hundred years ago, but my master remembered him well. This witcher was not stripped of emotions, you see, as his colleagues were. He had taken on a contract at Fort Ussar and required better gear.
Slavko Atimstein|He showed my master his diagrams, paid a deposit - and was never seen again. Apparently he rode off one night from the fort, never to return.
Geralt|Any idea where he went?
Slavko Atimstein|No, it's said he left in a rush, so he may have left something behind. Only ruins remain of Fort Ussar, but you may wish to search them.
Geralt|Started looking for those diagrams, but don't have them all yet.
Geralt|Interesting story. Fits right in with what I learned on my own. Found all the School of the Griffin diagrams, in any case.
Geralt|At heart, a sad story, that. Tragic, even.
Geralt|Let's talk about the Cat.
Slavko Atimstein|A year ago, Bartolomé de Launay, the ducal armorer, asked me to confirm the authenticity of a witcher diagram he had received by messenger.
Slavko Atimstein|You see, at the time he was working on new armor for the Ducal Guard. A witcher from the School of the Cat offered to sell him diagrams for a full set of gear. The diagrams would have been helpful indeed.
Geralt|The diagram you saw, was it really a witcher diagram?
Slavko Atimstein|Beyond any doubt. It's a shame de Launay didn't let me draft a copy. He was quite shaken up, afraid the witcher might simply kill him and take his coin.
Slavko Atimstein|Possibly a well-founded fear. Soon after, de Launay disappeared without a trace. I would have searched his former home for clues, but it has fallen into disrepair and it is simply too dangerous there.
Geralt|Found something. Not enough for a full set of gear, though.
Geralt|Found all the School of the Cat diagrams already.
Geralt|Tell me more about the Bear, can you?
Slavko Atimstein|He appeared shortly after master Tyen'sail took me on as his apprentice. I remember the bear head medallion that hung from his neck, I remember a towering witcher who haggled like a fishwife.
Geralt|Witchers never have too much coin.
Slavko Atimstein|True, this one clearly was not wealthy. But he pledged to bring us coin after he completed a contract at the Tufo Vineyard, where a building had just collapsed.
Slavko Atimstein|Time passed, the Bear never showed, and my master sent me to the Tufo estate. As it turned out the witcher had indeed accepted a job. Yet that was all they heard of him, and that is all I know.
Geralt|Interesting. Don't think I've found the complete set of School of the Bear diagrams, but I'll keep looking.
Geralt|Seems I found the full set of School of the Bear diagrams.
Geralt|School of the Manticore - probably know the least about it. Though once, long ago, wore some armor forged there.
Slavko Atimstein|My master said the Manticores have their fortress in the far east. A century past one of their number came to him, a witcher named Merten.
Slavko Atimstein|He made a poor impression on my master. He stank like a dwarven still and quarreled fiercely, all the time.
Slavko Atimstein|Tyen'sail slammed the door in his face and told him to return when he sobered up. He would conduct no business with a drunk.
Slavko Atimstein|The witcher, however, failed to return. Folk say he got into a booze-fueled brawl with the Ducal Guard. He was arrested and sentenced.
Slavko Atimstein|Bastoy Prison, where he was held, well, it's been a ruin for years. Still, you may want to start your search there?
Geralt|School of the Manticore gear's really rare. All the more reason to search for the remaining diagrams.
Geralt|Took quite the effort, but it was worth it. Got all the School of the Manticore diagrams.
Geralt|Like to ask you about something else.
Geralt|These diagrams - where do I look for them? Let's talk about the other witchers.
Slavko Atimstein|Of course. Where should I begin?
Geralt|Managed to find something already.
Slavko Atimstein|Wonderful! I shall draft a copy. This is good, this at last will earn me the title of grandmaster!
Slavko Atimstein|I thank you, witcher!
Geralt|This elven master, how'd he end up taking a human for an apprentice?
Slavko Atimstein|My father forged armor. As a youngster I helped him, then began forging my own pieces. Master Tyen'sail saw my work and offered to take me on as his apprentice.
Slavko Atimstein|Only now, years on, do I realize the honor that was.
Slavko Atimstein|Alas, my master perished in a massacre later, slain by racists. Though he taught me everything he knew, I did not manage to complete the guild's requirements for grandmaster while he lived.
Slavko Atimstein|I know I have no equal in the trade. Yet until I complete witcher armor of grandmaster quality, I shall never be certain I've become my teacher's equal.
Geralt|What do you have on offer?
Geralt|Would you craft something for me?
Slavko Atimstein|Of course.
Geralt|Farewell.
Slavko Atimstein|Good luck on the Path!
Geralt|Greetings.
Slavko Atimstein|A witcher! From the School of the Wolf! Here in Toussaint! Greetings! I'm Lazare Lafargue!
Geralt|Geralt of Rivia. Seem pretty enthused. Got a job for me?
Slavko Atimstein|Rather! Mind you, it's no monster hunt, but I'm sure you'll be interested all the same. I'm an armorer, see, and I've for years sought diagrams for witcher armor of exceptional quality, grandmaster level.
Geralt|Heard of 'em. Never seen any, though. Thought they were lost…
Slavko Atimstein|Not quite! For I've been lucky enough to learn that their holders came to Toussaint. Alas, they then perished, but I know where! I just need a partner to help me retrieve them.
Geralt|If you know where to look, why not get 'em yourself?
Slavko Atimstein|No offense, but do I look like a rough-hewn adventurer…? Besides, who would serve my clients while I romped about seeking them?
Slavko Atimstein|No… I rather leave it to someone familiar with such matters. Bring me the diagrams, and from them I'll forge for you whatever you fancy.
Geralt|Just so happens that's why I'm here. Look what I found.
Slavko Atimstein|This is quite the coincidence! It's exactly one of the diagrams I meant!
Geralt|Any idea how to find the others?
Slavko Atimstein|Of course, I just need a partner who will help me retrieve them. For a fitting reward, of course.
Geralt|I'll be honest - already found the others.
Slavko Atimstein|Without any hints as to their whereabouts? That's incredible!
Slavko Atimstein|You're back! So, how shall it be? Will you help hunt down the grandmaster diagrams? Those for witcher armor?
Slavko Atimstein|Greetings! I hope your search goes well.
Geralt|Hey, Lafargue.
Slavko Atimstein|Ah, good to see you!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Old Woman 01|I do not know how I will ever repay you, witcher.
Geralt|Don't expect to be paid. Hope you're feeling better, that's all.
Toussaint Old Woman 01|Oh, yes. I feel my strength returning, thanks chiefly to Barnabas-Basil's care.
Geralt|Horrible ordeal you endured. Glad I cut it short.
Toussaint Old Woman 01|Yes… years of suffering. Do you know what was worse than the hunger? Watching my loved ones… my children, grow old and die.
Toussaint Old Woman 01|All my family's long gone, now. The last of my kin perished decades past. I fear I've nowhere to go.
Geralt|Don't fear life, don't fear the world, don't fear others. Won't be easy after all these years, I know, but believe me… you belong among them.
Toussaint Old Woman 01|But… I've no one out there.
Geralt|Your family's gone - doesn't mean you won't meet someone new, grow to love them.
Toussaint Old Woman 01|You really think so?
Geralt|I'm sure of it.
Toussaint Old Woman 01|In that case, I thank you once more for your hospitality, for everything… Live well and prosper.
Geralt|Everything'll work out, you'll see. Farewell.
Geralt|This is a big house, big estate. You can stay here.
Toussaint Old Woman 01|Truly? I could never infringe so on your hospitality. Yet…
Geralt|Yeah?
Toussaint Old Woman 01|After all I've suffered, the years of starvation, I've but one dream - at last to prepare food that fortifies, nourishes, to delight in the tastes and smells of spices, to sit at one table with others and eat…
Geralt|Hmm… Don't see a problem if that's your dream. You could help Barnabas-Basil in the kitchen. Eaten his meals, you know he's not a culinary virtuoso.
Toussaint Old Woman 01|Nothing would make me happier. Thank you!
Geralt|No, thank you. House could use a woman's touch.
Toussaint Old Woman 01|I've one other thing I'd like to tell you. Many years ago my father assembled valuables for my dowry. I never wed, so they remained unclaimed. These baubles are no use to me now, but to you… Well, perhaps let them be a token of my gratitude.
Toussaint Old Woman 01|If you wish to find them, you must go to my old home, to Trastamara. The dowry lies hidden in a barrel in the cellar. There are several barrels, you must give each a knock until you find the right one.
Geralt|Do just that. Thanks.
Geralt|I'd never expect someone with your past to feel drawn to the kitchen…
Toussaint Old Woman 01|Do you fear I will cook in your home as I brewed as a wight?
Geralt|Heheh, counting on you having slightly better taste as a human.
Toussaint Old Woman 01|Of that you can be sure. I loved cooking, even as a child. My gran was a true master in the kitchen. Her spit-roasted ox was famed throughout the land.
Geralt|Thought you were a lady, owned an estate.
Toussaint Old Woman 01|Do you mean to say a woman of my rank should have had a cook? You're right, of course. And I had the best of cooks. But I devised the dishes myself. They only prepared them.
Geralt|You sure you don't feel lonely out here?
Toussaint Old Woman 01|I cannot say, yet. Too little time has passed since you freed me of my thrall. But somehow… for now, at least, I do not feel drawn to the city, to others.
Geralt|Visited others' homes as a wight.
Toussaint Old Woman 01|Yes, but ever at night, when all were asleep. I went in search of spoons…
Geralt|Remember, you can always change your mind. Decide you've lived here long enough, just say the word.
Toussaint Old Woman 01|I'd never wish to seem ungrateful.
Geralt|And I'd never want you to stay against your will.
Geralt|See you later.
Toussaint Old Woman 01|Take care, witcher. And remember, you always have warm food awaiting your return.
Toussaint Old Woman 01|I thank you for letting me stay. I cannot remember when last I was this happy.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|You in contact with Radovid?
Dijkstra|Hahahaha. See you're witty as ever. No, I'm not in contact with him and I'd prefer it remained that way.
Geralt|Never quite forgave you for conspiring with Philippa Eilhart?
Dijkstra|Radovid doesn't forgive. Not anything. Not anyone. And especially not the sorceress of the Lodge.
Geralt|Philippa Eilhart - had any news?
Dijkstra|Just good.
Geralt|Meaning?
Dijkstra|After Radovid popped her eyes out, she disappeared without a trace. If I've any luck, she's finally eating dirt.
Geralt|Thought you two were close…
Dijkstra|We were. Until Philippa sent assassins after me.
Geralt|Surprised to see you still dabbling in politics.
Dijkstra|It's quite simple, Geralt. I cannot be indifferent to Redania's fate. Call it… patriotic concern.
Geralt|Huh, so it's concern that compels you to bump off Radovid?
Dijkstra|I think often of the country and its future. And the more I think, the clearer it becomes that as long as Radovid sits on the throne, Redania has no future.
Geralt|From master spy to master criminal… Interesting progression.
Dijkstra|Why? Truth be told they're awfully similar. Both about maintaining a net of informers, being tough in negotiations, bribing officials… the occasional assassination. Same old shit.
Geralt|Yeah… Except you used to do that in the name of some ideal. And now?
Dijkstra|Now I've decided I've slaved enough for ideals. It's time I worked for myself. And thus far, it's been going rather well.
Geralt|Time I was on my way.
Dijkstra|Got things to do myself. So long!
Geralt|Got a minute?
Dijkstra|I do. What do you want?
Dijkstra|Right mess that was… Never thought I'd be glad to see the man responsible for my taking frequent baths.
Geralt|If you're any cleaner for it, gotta say it was worth breaking your ankle.
Dijkstra|It healed poorly - can you believe it?
Dijkstra|I must soak it in hot water at least six times a day now… Failing that, it bloody pounds like the bells of Beauclair at dawn.
Geralt|Sorry to hear that.
Dijkstra|You're sorry? Well, consider it resolved, then. Now, mind showing some added compassion? Could mean a miraculous recovery to me.
Geralt|Listen, Reuven… No, Dijkstra - just not in the mood for your code names, passwords and other bullshit.
Geralt|I'm here on specific business. If you wanna listen, listen, if not - I'd rather you spared me your wit and threw me out now.
Dijkstra|Ah, what's the harm? Talk.
Geralt|Think Cleaver'll find Whoreson?
Dijkstra|He might, he might not. But he'll burn down half the city trying. What waste. Leave him to it, I say, work alone.
Geralt|Any ideas?
Dijkstra|Junior's got areas of the city where he's strong. Penetrate them, look around. But be discrete - none of this speed and fury and swinging your steel cock about.
Geralt|Hmm, makes sense to ask around, I guess… Junior might be in hiding, but he's gotta be collecting income, couldn't afford to cut himself off.
Dijkstra|Gambling - that's his big earner. Junior controls the largest casino in town. I'll never forget - Hierarch Hemmelfart raised all kinds of hallowed hell there once. Bugger bet and lost his ruby ring.
Dijkstra|Then there's the arena in the city's bowels. Betting scheme generates near as much as the casino. They're always looking for hired muscle there.
Dijkstra|Suppose you could always search Whoreson's house, though I doubt you'll find him there. Maybe some clue, though.
Geralt|See if I can't find Whoreson at the casino or the arena. Might talk to Cleaver as well, though.
Dijkstra|Do what you will, just be cautious. Whoreson's expecting payback, I've no doubt.
Geralt|Thanks for your help, Dijkstra.
Dijkstra|Just go, witcher.
Dijkstra|And if you can't find the slimy bastard, come and see me. I know him well, might figure something out.
Geralt|Where's Junior's casino?
Dijkstra|Near the Temple Watch towers…
Dijkstra|Whoreson's got nowt to do with the casino officially, so careful what you say, try not to arouse any suspicions.
Geralt|Arena sounds promising. Where's that?
Dijkstra|Sewers beneath Gildorf, but you'll have to enter through the Bits, endure the stench of poverty on the way.
Dijkstra|Now, Junior loves a good fight. Wager he'd give a lot to see a real witcher in action.
Geralt|Mentioned Whoreson's got a house. Where is it?
Dijkstra|Solid townhouse on Temple Isle, just on the other side of the bridge. Wouldn't wager me knickers on finding him there. Junior's not that stupid.
Geralt|Pretty clear you and Bedlam don't want a war with Junior. Why?
Dijkstra|Let me tell you what I told King Vizimir time and time again: war doesn't solve any problems. It breeds trouble, trouble you then have to solve by other means.
Dijkstra|Make no mistake - someone's behind Whoreson's actions. I'll not end him until I know who.
Geralt|Your partners aware of your past? They know you're Sigismund Dijkstra, former head of Redanian intelligence?
Dijkstra|Heheh. Cleaver, Bedlam and Junior, well, I'd call them my partners if we'd built a mill to grind flour for the folk of nearby hamlets.
Dijkstra|But we just need to stay out of each others' ways, agree from time to time. That doesn't make us partners.
Dijkstra|Do they know who I am, was? Bedlam - sure. The others most likely suspect. But we just don't talk about it. No need to.
Geralt|I had my reasons. Your leg'd be fine if you hadn't gotten in my way.
Dijkstra|I see. Well, I promise you that if I could go back in time, I'd do things quite differently on Thanedd.
Dijkstra|For example, I'd have my men kill you instead of just tying you up.
<|endoftext|>
Dijkstra|Over here.
Dijkstra|Geralt, take a gander.
Dijkstra|Queen Hedvig fought harder than that!
Dijkstra|Aaargh!
Dijkstra|Gets you nothin', that!
Dijkstra|Enough of this foolery, Geralt!
Dijkstra|Fuck, Geralt. And I always liked you!
Dijkstra|You'll regret that provocation!
Dijkstra|Argh, show a little sense, will you?
Dijkstra|White Wolf?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Listen, need to broach a difficult topic… A young man from your clan - Skjall.
Donar An Hindar|Craven, you meant to say.
Geralt|That's just it. It was unjust of you to strip him of his name. He didn't run away, flee out of fear, he--
Donar An Hindar|Only blood can clear one of shame. Words change nothin'. Not his, not yours.
Geralt|With Bran gone, by my count that makes you the eldest of the jarls.
Donar An Hindar|Aye, it does. But I trust it'll not be for long.
Geralt|Uh, not like any of the others stand to out-age you.
Donar An Hindar|Nay. But I'll gladly pass the honor to the next in line.
Donar An Hindar|I've lived my fill: steeped my hand in the blood of foes, felt the warmth of the southern sun and the bite of northern winds, the touch of women of the east and west. Now, I wish to die a death worthy of song.
Geralt|What's new on Hindersfjall?
Donar An Hindar|New? Lofoten lies in ruins, the garden has been devastated…
Donar An Hindar|And now we must deal with an ulfhedin. In short, everything's grand.
Donar An Hindar|At least Morkvarg's a problem no more, thanks to you. Now if you could send the king of the Wild Hunt the same way…
Geralt|All in good time.
Geralt|Farewell.
Donar An Hindar|Greetings, Geralt.
Geralt|Donar an Hindar - did I get it right?
Donar An Hindar|You did. And you're that witcher they call the White Wolf. What do you want?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|How are things, Dudu?
Dudu Biberveldt|So-so, I suppose. Might've been days in the past when I'd 'ave said "wonderful," but I can't complain. I'm in one piece, not bound to a stake atop a pyre.
Geralt|Ever considered leaving, forgetting Novigrad altogether?
Dudu Biberveldt|What for - to pass from the frying pan into the fire? The war's not yet crept here, famine's not kicked at our door. Not that the future's looking rosy…
Geralt|But you don't have to be human. Maybe you could try something else?
Dudu Biberveldt|I've assumed many forms over the years, and in spite of all, life as a human has proven most interesting. After all, you humans rule the world.
Geralt|Gotta admit, your Menge - it's a brilliant impersonation.
Dudu Biberveldt|Don't remind me. I'm rather disgusted.
Geralt|Come on, he wasn't all out terrible.
Dudu Biberveldt|You understand nothing. A doppler assumes more than a man's external appearance. I've learnt what a scoundrel had knocking about in his head.
Dudu Biberveldt|Once I became him, not an hour passed before I felt the urge to break a sorceress' fingers. After two I caught myself lusting to impale someone, and immediately after that it hit me - the paranoic fear of a doppler conspiracy.
Geralt|Dudu, tell me - the halfling Biberveldt goes from being a properous merchant to being a pauper. How?
Dudu Biberveldt|Prefer the long version or the short?
Geralt|Short, please.
Dudu Biberveldt|The war.
Geralt|I was under the impression merchants grow fat on wars.
Dudu Biberveldt|Some do, but I've a serious personality flaw - I'm honest. I could not reap profits from the suffering of others, I paid taxes, I never cooked my books.
Dudu Biberveldt|And then a ship full of my goods sank. I pulled through somehow, but then a second fell prey to Skelligan raiders, rendering me insolvent.
Dudu Biberveldt|When inflation hit, and interest rates rose, I, at long last, fell.
Geralt|Take care of yourself, Dudu.
Dudu Biberveldt|Oh, those bigots haven't the cunning to strip me of this mask.
Dudu Biberveldt|Greetings.
Geralt|You've been Menge, now you're Whoreson Junior.
Dudu Biberveldt|Apparently, you must be a rogue to survive in this city.

<|endoftext|>
Dandelion|Radovid had many faults. He was cruel, impetuous and pathologically ambitious.
Dandelion|But he was a tactical genius - that's undeniable. Commanding forces far outnumbered by his foe's, he handily defeated the invader from the south.
Dandelion|The Redanian Eagle spread its wings, taking all the North, including Novigrad, beneath them.
Dandelion|The 3rd Northern War was a clash between two great strategists: Radovid V, known as "The Stern," and Emhyr var Emreis.
Dandelion|Both seemed invincible, yet both were defeated. Nilfgaard, invading from the south, was repelled in the field, while the North's "supreme leader" fell victim to assassins.
Dandelion|Yet Redania stood victorious, and a man who had thus far operated in shadow took up the reins of power. That man was Sigismund Dijkstra.
Dandelion|The 3rd Northern War had ended - the invader from the south had achieved complete victory.
Dandelion|Robbed of Radovid's tactical genius, the Northern Realms could not withstand Emhyr's countless legions.
Dandelion|Black banners appeared over Novigrad and all Redania.
Dandelion|With victory in the war against Nilfgaard secured, Radovid proceeded to complete his witch hunt.
Dandelion|As they had in Novigrad, pyres burned in Temeria and Aedirn, lands now "liberated" by the Redanian monarch. In the drive for moral renewal, simple herbalists, pellars, healers and nonhumans - all supposed heretics - were murdered in droves.
Dandelion|For many, freedom beneath Radovid's scepter proved more tragic than servitude to another.
Dandelion|Once firmly in the chancellor's seat, Dijkstra ruled the victorious North in his patently cynical and ruthless manner.
Dandelion|He knew that to preserve peace he would have to prepare for war. Following Nilfgaard's example, he consolidated his rule over vast lands through a broad program of settlement and industrialization.
Dandelion|All for the good of his subjects - though often contrary to their will.
Dandelion|Weary of rebel raids, Emhyr var Emreis conceded, restoring Temeria as a realm in liege to the empire.
Dandelion|When the guerillas laid down their arms, the emperor shifted his forces to other fronts.
Dandelion|Thus, through Nilfgaard's victory, Temerians got their country back, while history once again proved a consummate trickster.
Dandelion|Having dealt with Radovid, Emhyr var Emreis did the same with enemies domestic.
Dandelion|The emperor's loyal spies named all who had conspired against him - traders, soldiers and aristocrats alike.
Dandelion|Though their mutiny had only been a murky plan, the emperor showed no mercy. As was his wont.
Dandelion|As long as his armies went from one victory to the next, Emhyr's subjects remained boundlessly obedient.
Dandelion|When a string of humiliating defeats proved var Emreis fallible, the opposition - thus far secret - attacked.
Dandelion|The subjects of the emperor who had danced on the graves of his foes laid him to rest in a tomb of his own.
Dandelion|While the Continent bled engulfed by war, Skellige bloomed under Cerys' enlightened rule.
Dandelion|Unlike those who had come before her, the young queen did not raid foreign shores, looking instead to her people, tending to her land.
Dandelion|The island bound nation prospered, though its fangs of yore were dulled.
Dandelion|Though the war on the Continent had ended, Hjalmar refused to lay down his arms.
Dandelion|The young king pledged to raid and burn the shores of the Empire of Nilfgaard each spring. He meant to keep his word, even at the cost of drowning his people in their own blood.
Dandelion|Many islanders believed Svanrige would be no more than his ambitious mother's puppet. The young king proved them wrong, ignoring her whims and ruling with an iron hand all his own.
Dandelion|Tired of the jarls and their endless feuds, he resolved to turn the Isles into an absolute monarchy modeled after those of the Continent.
Dandelion|What he resolved, he achieved, but only by shedding his countrymen's blood.
Dandelion|Cirilla Fiona Ellen Riannon, heir to Nilfgaard's throne, chose the life of a witcher, on the Path.
Dandelion|Geralt taught her all he knew, every skill he possessed, then each set off on their own.
Dandelion|It wasn't long before word of the ashen-haired witcheress had spread throughout the North, from the Yaruga to the mountains of Kovir…
Dandelion|After years in exile, Ciri returned to Nilfgaard, her paternal home, where Emhyr prepared to name her his successor.
Dandelion|The woman had the necessary qualities. From her father she'd inherited an empress' political instincts. From Geralt she had gained a sense of simple, human decency.
Dandelion|Few monarchs boast both traits - which is quite a shame…
Dandelion|As for Ciri? That's hard to say. Since the events on Undvik, she has yet to be seen.
Dandelion|Which does not mean she is never to return.
Dandelion|Hard as it may be to believe, Geralt planted roots - in faraway Kovir.
Dandelion|He and Triss settled down, their home warm and smelling of freshly baked cakes. Guests were always welcome, no matter the day or the hour.
Dandelion|The witcher would take jobs at times, more from habit than need. For Triss earned a true fortune as the mage advisor to Kovir's king.
Dandelion|"And what of Geralt?"- you might ask. Well…
Dandelion|He continued on as before, living hand to mouth, job to job, on the road, ever coinless.
Dandelion|We would meet at times over a glass of strong drink  to talk about the old days and speculate what could have, would have, might have been…
Dandelion|While monarchs moved borders and populations, Geralt and Yennefer lived a calm, quiet life far from all things political.
Dandelion|They breakfasted well after noon, more often than not in bed, and passed the days on lazy strolls and long conversations.
Dandelion|Boring, you say? Perhaps. But both had sought this more than anything else.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Got the reward I promised you… Mahakaman spirit.
Eskel|Hah! Lambert claimed you'd forget. Thanks, brother.
Geralt|Did everything to deserve it. Well, Scorpion did. But I'm not about to ply your horse with vodka.
Geralt|Happen on any interesting contracts lately?
Eskel|Er, not lately. But about half a year back I slew a manticore in Creyden, in a forest. Quick son of a bitch, that one.
Eskel|Jumped out of the undergrowth so fast my medallion didn't have time to give me so much as one twitch. Won't show you the scar – too big a boy for that.
Geralt|Get a nice sum at least?
Eskel|Huh, not one copper. Showed the beast's head to the elder in the nearest village. He swore on all the gods it was the first he'd heard of the monster.
Eskel|What about you?
Geralt|Besides the griffin, same ol', same ol' – nekkers, ghouls, drowners… Haven't seen a manticore in… must be a year, now.
Geralt|See you.
Geralt|Eskel.
Eskel|Hm?

Baron Bandit Strong 02|What do they call you? Know how to fight?
Geralt|Geralt. And yes.
Baron Bandit Strong 02|Hah. Then enter the lists, my friend!
Geralt|I'm ready. Let's fight.
Baron Bandit Strong 02|Good folk! Fishgulper's finally found a foe! Right here, right now, on the field of honor, he'll face none other than Geralt of Rivia, the, uh… Hammer!
Verden Peasant 05|Spare me a minute 'fore the fight, master? Please…
Verden Peasant 05|Cut o' your mug's plain as day. What'm I beside ye? I just wanna live… These days streams're bereft, no fish for me to gulp… and they's givin' a sack o' flour to the winner.
Verden Peasant 05|Show some pity. Take a fall for me.
Geralt|All right. So be it.
Geralt|Not about to lose on purpose. If you wanna win, you gotta beat me.
Geralt|Let's do this, let's fight.
Baron Bandit Strong 02|Geralt the Hammer versus Fishgulper! The rematch!
Geralt|Thanks, some other time, maybe.
Baron Bandit Strong 02|So, will you try again?
<|endoftext|>
Baron Bandit Strong 02|We all saw it! Geralt tanned Fishgulper's hide!
Verden Peasant 05|Ye tricked me. 'Tis true what they say - witchers don't got human hearts.
Baron Bandit Strong 02|Don't know how it happened, but Fishgulper swallowed the Hammer!
Verden Peasant 05|Thanks, witcher.
Baron Bandit Strong 02|Fishgulper wins! Remains local champion!
Baron Bandit Strong 02|Yes, we might've known! The witcher took Fishgulper and fist-ploughed his gob! Near warmed my heart to see him renovate his head!
Baron Bandit Strong 02|I hereby declare Geralt the champion! If he wants, he can try his strength against Jonah or Smithy.
Baron Bandit Strong 02|You get the urge to fight Stan again, come back any time.
Baron Bandit Strong 02|Time to face the sergeant, champion of these lands. You'll find him at Crow's Perch.
Baron Bandit Strong 02|Not bad, not bad. Time to try your luck against Jonah… And then there's Smithy at the Inn at the Crossroads. Go to it, friend.
Baron Bandit Strong 02|You've still Smithy to defeat. No reason to wait.
Baron Bandit Strong 02|There's Jonah still. You can arrange to fight him if you want.
<|endoftext|>
Baron Bandit Strong 03|Will you join the tournament? Eh? A bit of honest fist fightin' to clear the lungs and bowels.
Baron Bandit Strong 03|Though I warn you, Jonah can be fierce. Likes to bite, get me? So, what'll it be?
Geralt|All right, let's see just how fierce Jonah is.
Baron Bandit Strong 03|Feast your eyes on an epic clash between Jonah and the drifter!
Geralt|Let's do this.
Baron Bandit Strong 03|Another showdown - Jonah and the drifter! Fight!
Geralt|What're the rules?
Baron Bandit Strong 03|We mostly use fists, but no one looks askance at the stray kick to the stones.
Baron Bandit Strong 03|Defeat Jonah, then Smithy and Stan Fishgulper, and you'll earn the right to face the sergeant - Velen's champion.
Geralt|Some other time.
Geralt|Wanna fight again.
Baron Bandit Strong 03|No problem at all!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|I'm ready.
Baron Bandit Weak 01|Hah! Look who we have here!
Geralt|Let's start.
Sergeant|All right, come to daddy.
Geralt|The baron know this is how his men amuse themselves?
Baron Bandit Weak 01|Baron knows all about it. Even bets on the fights sometimes.
Sergeant|Bets like a dumb fuck. Always loses.
Geralt|Baron's gone, but seems business is booming.
Baron Bandit Weak 01|Folk're more eager than ever to see the men go at it.
Geralt|Business seems good, even with the baron gone.
Baron Bandit Weak 01|Life's short, but art's eternal.
Geralt|Don't feel like fighting right now.
Baron Bandit Weak 01|The witcher defeated Olaf - champion of all Skellige for years! No one could best him, 'cause the whoreson feeds on man flesh!
Baron Bandit Weak 01|This here witcher defeated the Novigrad champion, the terrible elf known as the Tailor!
Baron Bandit Weak 01|The witcher is champion of Novigrad and Skellige! Will our sergeant break his winning streak?
Baron Bandit Weak 01|It's not the time for brawls, now. Come back another day.
Baron Bandit Weak 01|See the flames? What're you thinkin'? There's no fightin' now!.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Greetings.
Skellige Warrior 03|Heard of you. People! Look who's come to fight!
Skellige Warrior 03|That is why you're here, right?
Geralt|Ready to fight anytime, even now.
Skellige Warrior 05|Like to have some words with the outlander, first.
Skellige Warrior 05|It's about my Eryka. See her? I… I gotta win today. She's watchin'.
Skellige Warrior 05|I don't stand a chance against ye, I know it well. But I was thinkin' - maybe you'd let me win?
Geralt|All right. We'll do it like this: first fight, I'll take a dive. But then we'll go at it again… best man wins.
Skellige Warrior 03|Enough of this chatter! Fight!
Geralt|Listen, if I lose on purpose, we'll both regret it, believe me.
Skellige Warrior 05|But it's Eryka we're talkin' about! You don't understand a thing.
Geralt|Ready to fight right now.
Skellige Warrior 03|Done well so far. Hope your luck continues against Olaf.
Geralt|Let's start.
Skellige Warrior 03|Well, then! Fight!
Geralt|Tournament rules, what are they?
Skellige Warrior 03|The fighters are both upstarts seekin' to prove their grit and brawn and courage, and old hands just lookin' to keep the rust at bay.
Skellige Warrior 03|Ye get similar bouts in Novigrad and Velen, but those're glorified tavern brawls, ye ask me. This here's a minor festival.
Geralt|Might fight some other time. See you.
Geralt|I wanna fight.
Skellige Warrior 03|Grand! Tell me when you're ready.
Geralt|Thinking of trying my hand…
Skellige Warrior 03|Soon as you're ready, come forth and speak up.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Warrior 03|Our winner is the outlander!
Skellige Warrior 05|You promised!
Skellige Woman 05|Pansy.
Geralt|She wasn't worth it.
Skellige Warrior 03|You've two bouts more 'fore you can challenge for the title of best in Skellige. You've got to defeat Einar, to be found on Faroe, and one Grim of Helmstein, a village on Ard Skellig. Good luck to ye.
Skellige Warrior 03|You've Einar still to fight.
Skellige Warrior 03|You've still Grim to face. A worthy foe.
Skellige Warrior 03|The outlander's proven himself worthy o' facin' Olaf! Your opponent, Skellige's champion, awaits on An Skellig.
Skellige Warrior 03|Valgard wins!
Skellige Warrior 05|Thanks!
Skellige Woman 05|You're good with your hands.
Skellige Warrior 05|Aye, I am.
Skellige Warrior 03|The outlander's won!
Skellige Warrior 05|Eryka, wait!
Geralt|Let her go.
Skellige Warrior 03|Valgard's won!
Skellige Warrior 05|Hah!
Skellige Woman 05|You're good, real good.
Skellige Warrior 05|Didn't even break a sweat.
Skellige Warrior 03|Outlander's won! Honor and glory are his!
Skellige Warrior 03|Our winner is Valgard!
Skellige Warrior 03|You can come back anytime, challenge 'im again. Them's the rules.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Looking for more challengers?
Skellige Warrior 02|Welcome to our tournament, witcher. Einar awaits an opponent - do you wish to face him?
Geralt|Let's not keep Einar waiting.
Skellige Warrior 02|May it be a clean and beautiful fight.
Skellige Warrior 02|If you win, you're entitled to fight our champion.
Skellige Warrior 02|Fight!
Geralt|Einar looks like quite the fighter.
Skellige Warrior 02|He's Madman Lugos' bastard. Takes after his da.
Skellige Warrior 04|So we gonna fight or chatter?
Geralt|I'll try another time.
Geralt|Einar still want to fight?
Skellige Warrior 02|That's all he's good for. You wish to face him?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Greetings. You know me?
Skellige Bandit 02|Aye, I've heard of you.
Skellige Bandit 02|Don't recall exactly why - but I'm sure it was unsavory.
Geralt|Heard you, uh, hold fights here…
Skellige Bandit 02|Ye, uh, heard right. Try your luck if ye like.
Geralt|I'm ready.
Skellige Bandit 02|Fight mercilessly, but do it with honor!
Skellige Bandit 02|And save some strength for your next bout, haha!
Geralt|I'm ready.
Skellige Bandit 02|That's grand! In that case, fight!
Geralt|Who's my opponent?
Skellige Bandit 02|Haha, curiosity's bit ye, eh? His name's Grim - whooo… He's a lumberjack - spends winters brawlin' in taverns. Tried to win the championship this season, but… twaddle, nothin' came of it.
Geralt|I'll try another time.
Skellige Bandit 02|You're the one saved Jarl Udalryk!
Skellige Bandit 02|You joined Hjalmar's crew, went and killed the giant of Undvik!
Skellige Bandit 02|Folan's been me mate since we were tykes - and you done saved his life!
Geralt|Wanna fight again.
Skellige Bandit 02|Soon as you're ready, just say the word.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Guard 01|You've come to fight Olaf… He's long awaited a worthy opponent.
Geralt|I wanna face Olaf.
Skellige Guard 01|Fist fightin's a Skellige tradition. And here on An Skellig, that tradition's damn near hallowed.
Geralt|I'll fight as though my life depended on it.
Skellige Guard 01|What do they call ye?
Geralt|Geralt of Rivia.
Skellige Guard 01|Geralt of Rivia - enter the arena.
Skellige Guard 01|Geralt of Rivia - enter the arena.
Skellige Guard 01|Emerge victorious, and you'll have the honor to face the Champion of Champions.
Geralt|What makes your tradition special?
Skellige Guard 01|Warrior by the name of Duns Ursus once lived on An Skellig. Fought monsters with his bare hands. Tourney's held in his honor.
Geralt|Changed my mind. I'm not gonna fight Olaf.
Skellige Guard 01|Change your mind again - be sure to come back.
Geralt|Hm, these tourneys are usually held on street corners, in taverns at best… Got a real arena here.
Skellige Guard 01|Built thanks to another's generosity - Birna Bran donated her jewels.
Geralt|All right - where's Olaf?
Skellige Guard 01|He'll show, soon as he's got an opponent.
Geralt|Not gonna fight now. Not in the mood.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Guard 01|You defeated Olaf, 'twas a fair fight.
Geralt|Anyone else out there I could fight?
Skellige Guard 01|Once you're all done, sail to Spikeroog. It's there you'll fight to be Champion of Champions.
Skellige Guard 01|You've defeated everyone there was to defeat in Skellige. Makes you Champion of the Isles. Take pride, friend.
Geralt|Fought enough today. See you.
Skellige Guard 01|If you've been named champion of Velen already, try your luck in Novigrad.
Skellige Guard 01|If you've bested all in Novigrad, try your luck in Velen.
Skellige Guard 01|Greetings.
Skellige Guard 01|Isles're home to many a brave lad you'd find it hard to best. If you've not defeated 'em all, seek 'em out and challenge 'em.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Hey there.
Skellige Warrior 05|Oh, the mutant, eh? Don't make a face. It's good y'are one. Ordinary bloke'd never stand a chance against the Champion of Champions. You have come to challenge him, haven't ye?
Geralt|I wanna fight the Champion of Champions.
Skellige Warrior 05|What do they call ye?
Geralt|Geralt of Rivia.
Geralt|I'm ready to fight.
Skellige Warrior 05|Geralt of Rivia - time to begin.
Geralt|Current champion's a troll. Everybody all right with that, no one's got a problem?
Skellige Warrior 05|Why would they? He's an honorable troll. Came and said he wanted to fight and the previous champion agreed. That'd be Zama, known also as Sandylocks. And he got the name even 'fore the troll planted 'im in the dirt head first.
Geralt|Troll have a name?
Skellige Warrior 05|We wager he does, but he’ll not reveal it till he's defeated. He's a troll errant, see?
Geralt|Won't say much if he doesn't survive that fight.
Skellige Warrior 05|Aye, fair enough. But I wager he don't imagine he'll lose… And maybe, as he's a troll, he don't imagine much at all. Doubt logic's his strong suit.
Geralt|Anything I should know about my opponent? Had to fight a bear earlier. Bit surprised…
Skellige Warrior 05|Go with him. He'll lead you where you need to go.
Skellige Warrior 01|Behold, the Champion of Champions.
Geralt|A rock troll. A very well-developed rock troll.
Geralt|This supposed to be a fistfight?
Skellige Warrior 05|Aye, fists.
Skellige Warrior 05|Err… 'course, we provide a dignified funeral, observin' the rituals o' the challenger's creed.
Geralt|I'll be back. See you.
Skellige Warrior 05|Greetin's!
Skellige Warrior 05|Ye here to fight for the title o' champion?
Geralt|Mhm.
Skellige Warrior 05|I'm afeared you'll have to wait. Arena's closed on account of a certain, uh, incident. An incident to be examined, conclusions to be drawn, so it don't happen again.
Skellige Warrior 05|Fights're still suspended, Awful sorry.
Geralt|Nobody mentioned I'd be fighting a troll. Supposed to be a surprise?
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Master Claytop heartily greets the challenger!
Geralt|Greetings to Master Claytop from Geralt.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Will you take up the challenge? Will you face our tavern's champion?
Geralt|Yeah, I'll fight this Gregorio fellow.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Your attention, please! This fine witcher has agreed to join in battle with our tavern's champion - Georgius Georg!
Novigrad Rich Man 01|While our champion prepares, you and I should have a chat.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Let us talk coin. I shall be blunt - you stand to earn a great deal… provided you follow a few recommendations.
Geralt|You asking me to cheat?
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Not to cheat - to engage in an enterprise, that is all. What say you?
Geralt|A bucket of coin for taking some hits to the face? Tempting offer. I'm in. What do I do?
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Nothing much. Throw some punches, not too many, mind, and then let him drop you.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|A warm welcome to our competitors as they enter the ring! Geralt versus Georgius Georg, the Piledriver. May the better man win!
Geralt|Kiss my ass, Master Claytop.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|You'll regret that.
Geralt|How much'll you give me to throw the fight?
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Considerably more than if you win.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|The rules are childishly simple. Defeat Georg, you get a bulging purse.
Geralt|Anything else I should know?
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Put on a good show, and the crowd will love you.
Geralt|Maybe later.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Welcome back! Prepared to fight?
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Rich Man 01|I trust you'll remember this lesson for the rest of your life. You stood to make a killing, but had scruples, instead.
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|Not too shabby, witcher.
Geralt|Good fight. Congratulations.
Geralt|You're bothering me, Master Claytop.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Congratulations! A beautiful fight. Your reward, as promised.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|I made you a lucrative offer, did I not?!
Geralt|Yeah, but there's nothing quite like robbing a thief or cheating a cheat.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|I shall remember this. Master Claytop never forgets a slight.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Archibald O'Neill is another brawler you can fight. You'll find him near the entrance to the slums.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|There's also Mortimer, captain of the Guard. He can usually be found near the Oxenfurt Gate.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|The witcher has fulfilled all conditions required to challenge Novigrad's reigning champion - Durden the Tailor!
Novigrad Rich Man 01|The bout is to take place beyond the city walls after dusk.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Our winner and the tavern's new champion is… the witcher called Geralt! Here is your prize.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|The witcher Geralt has been defeated. It follows logically that Georgius Georg, known also as Piledriver, remains unbeaten!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Name's Geralt.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Patty Gruber. I'm a bookie. I trust you're here to fight.
Geralt|I'm ready.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Hear that?! A fight at last! Our champion, Archibald O'Neill, to face Geralt!
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Fight!
Geralt|I'm ready.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Fight!
Geralt|What can you tell me about these fights?
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Bouts are held in Novigrad, the Skellige Isles, and in Velen. Each region has its champion. But to face the said champion, you must first defeat three other contenders in that region.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Defeat the champions of Velen, Skellige and Novigrad, and you'll win the prestigious title of Champion of Champions.
Geralt|Think I'll fight some other time.
Geralt|I wanna face O'Neill again.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Excellent.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|I'm Geralt of Rivia.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|It matters not what you're called, it matters not where you're from. What matters is if you're prepared to fight Captain Mortimer!
Geralt|I'm ready. Let 's do this.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Fight!
Geralt|Let's go.
Redanian Officer 01|Put 'em up.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Fight!
Geralt|Who organizes these fights?
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Tournaments like this have been held in Skellige, Velen and Novigrad for ages. Each region has its own champion.
Redanian Officer 01|Novigrad's is the Tailor. Defeat Mortimer and you'll gain the right to challenge him.
Geralt|I'll be back.
Geralt|Already met the captain once.
Redanian Officer 01|I remember you, mutant.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|The air grows thick with hostility! Place your bets quick, I shan't be able to hold them back much longer!
Geralt|Wanna fight Mortimer again.
Redanian Officer 01|Be delighted to pummel the sot one more time.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Rich Man 11|We've been expecting you. We're already taking bets.
Elf Man 01|You've been weighed, you've been measured, and you've been found scrawny. In what world could you possibly defeat me?
Geralt|Came here to fight the Tailor, so let's do this.
Novigrad Rich Man 11|Novigraders one and all! A momentous occurrence! Before us, in just minutes, Geralt of Rivia will face the Tailor!
Elf Man 01|Come here, bitch… Uncle Durden wants to sew you a new face.
Geralt|I'm ready.
Novigrad Rich Man 11|Fight!
Geralt|This elf's a dick. That been the case with all champions of Novigrad?
Elf Man 01|No. I am the first. Do you know why they call me the Tailor? It began after I'd gutted some men. With these very hands.
Geralt|Hrr, knew that was gonna be a shitty story.
Geralt|Sorry, your elf's an idiot. Not about to touch him, let alone fight him.
Novigrad Rich Man 11|Don't rule out the stranger - he's defeated the illustrious Olaf of Skellige!
Novigrad Rich Man 11|The newcomer may seem all skin and bones, but remember, he defeated the sergeant to the Bloody Baron of Velen!
Novigrad Rich Man 11|And Olaf of Skellige as well!
Geralt|I wanna fight the Tailor… again.
Novigrad Rich Man 11|Hehehe, be my guest.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Scribe 01|I've had my eye on you. Tremendous potential!
Skellige Scribe 01|Would you consider dropping these amateur hayseed thumps? Fighting professionally, perhaps?
Geralt|I can sure as hell try.
Skellige Scribe 01|Excellent! There's an arena on the isle of Spikeroog - that's where the current Champion of Champions fights.
Skellige Scribe 01|I shall warn them you're on your way to issue a challenge. Farewell.
Geralt|Not sure I know what you mean.
Skellige Scribe 01|I seek someone who has what it takes to dethrone the Champion of Champions.
Skellige Scribe 01|A certain Skelliger now holds the title. I believe you alone stand to beat him.
Skellige Scribe 01|Ask yourself: am I man enough to sail to Skellige and throw down the gauntlet to the Champion of Champions?
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Shall you face off against Still Waters? Shall you? Shall you?
Geralt|I challenge you to a duel.
Toussaint Bard Woman 02|Mhm.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Noble lords and virtuous ladies! Another fight is soon to begin!
Geralt|Like to know who I'm punching. This knight won't reveal his name or face? Won't say anything at all, not a word?
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Rein in your curiosity, sir. A knightly vow is no idle promise! Still Waters shall conceal both face and crest until such time as one defeats him.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|So, will you fight or not?
Geralt|Think I might come back some other time.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|The famed witcher! Now here's a man who looks primed to try his strength against Still Waters! Shall you thrown down the gauntlet?
Geralt|Don't know the rules yet. Nor what I'll be fighting for.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Fighters use their fists, and the last combatant left standing wins. Glory is the stake! The title of best pugilist in Beauclair the prize! Oh, and honor!
Geralt|Honor. How could I forget.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Defeat all three lesser contestants and you shall gain the right to face the Maestro himself.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Witcher! Welcome back. A duel with Still Waters - wouldn't that be something? Care to challenge?
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Oh, now you look to be a man in search of exertion! Hey! Whitelocks! Will you dare to fight Colossus?
Geralt|Fine. Let's fight.
Toussaint Bandit Strong 03|Bleh, boooring. I'm not interested. Quick I am, too quick for you. It'll be knick-knack paddy whack, here's your arm bone. Where's the sport in it?
Geralt|Don't wanna fight? Why bother looking for challengers, then? Wasting my time.
Toussaint Bandit Strong 03|Whoa, a bit testy, are we? A witcher, right? Let's do it like this - you parry three blows I throw your way, you win. But you can't swing at me. Not once.
Toussaint Bandit Strong 03|Just deflect my blows, got it? Catch three of them, and I'll toss you double your wager.
Geralt|Feeling that generous?
Toussaint Bandit Strong 03|No. I just know you can't do it. No one's ever done it. Too fast, see? So, willing to try for three blocks?
Geralt|Fine. Doubt I'll have any trouble deflecting a few blows.
Toussaint Bandit Strong 03|That I get. At long last, one with a sportsman's soul. Now listen, the rules say you're not to start your parry until I've cocked my fist. Standing with your guard up's not allowed!
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Ladies and gentlemen! Witness a most peculiar fight! How shall I say this? The witcher has accepted a colossal challenge!
Geralt|Prefer to slap you around the ordinary way.
Toussaint Bandit Strong 03|Ehh, disappointing. This witcher's no fun at all. Oh well, I suppose it makes little difference.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Ladies and gentlemen! A fight, a fight, a fight, at last! Standard regulations! Witcher versus Colossus!
Geralt|Colossus? Interesting as monickers go. Or is that what his mother called him out of the womb, too?
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Why would she not have? Colossus - it rings out with pride and passion! So, will you fight?
Geralt|Not in the mood for a scrap just now. Maybe later.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|A witcher? Would you stand against Colossus, sir?
Geralt|Nature of the contest?
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Pounding, punching, regulation pugilism. The first to swoon, loses. Simple, is it not?
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Defeat the three lesser champions to face the Maestro himself. Pure diversion. So, are you in?
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Witcher. Colossus awaits. Ready to test your strength?
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Do you wish to jump in?
Geralt|Considering it.
Toussaint Dockworker 03|So you're not surprised, consider this as well - here intellect counts as much as strength.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|You see, Mancomb is no ordinary fighter.
Geralt|Fine. Let's start.
Toussaint Dockworker 03|Oooh! My knees quake like a carnival rattle!
Geralt|Let's get on with this ridiculous battle.
Toussaint Dockworker 03|I'm a top taunter, the best around - not one to be beaten by some inbred hound!
Geralt|Your taunts? I've heard dogs retch things more profound. Hear how pathetic and stupid you sound?
Toussaint Dockworker 03|Well, how then is this for a clever tongue-twister - you're a bumbotching, blackened bile-filled blister!
Geralt|Your mother must've walked many a wood alone. Got those nekker eyes, that nekker nose…
Toussaint Dockworker 03|My mother loved me, at the least. That's nothing any witcher can claim.
Geralt|See why'd you say that, you dim flapdoodle. Too dumb to grasp insults this brutal.
Toussaint Dockworker 03|Ehh, I've got to admit - you know how to roast a man. You win.
Geralt|Mean we're not gonna fight?
Toussaint Dockworker 03|Why? I told you, you've won.
Geralt|Done with this. You're weak - just trying to avoid a fight.
Toussaint Dockworker 03|Let's end this pitiful farce. You, witcher, are the dullest man alive.
Toussaint Dockworker 03|Put up your guard!
Geralt|Finally…
Geralt|Fancy insults - not my thing. Know other more effective means.
Geralt|Think you're confused, that sounds more like your sister. I'm immune to disease, but even I'd die if I kissed her.
Toussaint Dockworker 03|You aren't worthy to empty my sister's bedpan! You mange-ridden mutant! Not even a man!
Geralt|Should've quit before we began - gonna make you wish you'd turned tail and ran.
Toussaint Dockworker 03|Why, you… bad, uh…
Geralt|Now I know how you do it. Just annoy your opponents to death.
Geralt|Guess you'd know - since your mom's a bitch.
Toussaint Dockworker 03|Ugh, pathetic. This'll be easy. What's wrong? Afraid? Gut feeling queasy?
Geralt|Yeah. You stink something vicious. It's making me sick.
Toussaint Dockworker 03|Pfff… Give it up, go home, your efforts are futile. Your wit's as flaccid as a wet noodle.
Geralt|Your bones look thin, your breathing's wheezy.
Geralt|Afraid one punch might kill you - it's got me uneasy.
Geralt|Mancomb? First I've ever encountered that name.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|One should never judge an opponent by his name. Master Mancomb is a saddler, though a valiant one at that. His blows are as fierce as his ripostes are sharp.
Geralt|Don't want to fight just now.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Should you change your mind, look in on us again.
Geralt|Wanna fight.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|The rules governing the Beauclair fist fighting circuit - are you familiar with them?
Geralt|Hmm, you fight… with fists… There much to add beyond that…?
Toussaint Noble Man 03|You must make a wager to join the contest. There are three champions. Challenge them all, defeat them honorably, and you may try your luck against the Maestro.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Ready to fight?
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Inconceivable! An unprecedented contest! Though walloped in the battle of wits, the witcher still managed to beat Mancomb! Literally! We've never seen this before!
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Two more champions to defeat before you can challenge the Maestro. Still Waters is to be found in Hauteville, not far from Mountebank Alley. While Colossus fights in the largest courtyard in Saint Sebastian.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|You've one opponent left, but what a foe he is - Colossus. The fastest fighter around. Find him in Saint Sebastian, look for the largest courtyard in the district. Beat him and you may face the Maestro.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|You've but one foe left before you can challenge the Maestro. The mysterious knight, Still Waters, famed throughout the duchy, his true face and name unknown. You'll find him in Hauteville, near Mountebank Alley.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Thus you've gained the right to challenge the Maestro. Look for him at the docks. And congratulations - I'm impressed.
Geralt|Thanks.
Toussaint Dockworker 03|You out-tongued me… But only because I'm under the weather today. I'd have lashed you raw, otherwise.
Geralt|Right. Sure.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|The witcher has lost. Refusing in a battle of wits to engage, he thoroughly Master Mancomb enraged. Who has no patience for purse-lipped pugilists stripped of panache.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|The witcher tastes defeat, while Mancomb proves victorious at his own game! Perhaps next time, monster slayer.
Toussaint Dockworker 03|None's ever out-bantered me. I'm a good… talker… fellow. And that's that.
Toussaint Dockworker 03|You throw hard punches… but your taunts need attention.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Mancomb tosses taunts sharp as daggers!
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Though a man of few words and even fewer jests, the witcher is ever a fighter! Geralt has vanquished Mancomb!
Toussaint Noble Man 03|The witcher wins! Beating Mancomb at his own game!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Ladies and gentlemen! The witcher defeats the previously invincible Still Waters! And what a bout it was!
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Freed of his vow, the knight can now show his face!
Toussaint Bard Woman 02|Your blows are strong and true. My congratulations.
Geralt|Thanks.
Toussaint Bard Woman 02|Have you naught to add? I'm a woman - no wry remarks?
Geralt|What for? It's the thirteenth century. Nothing peculiar about it. Women own taverns, run farms and… fight.
Toussaint Bard Woman 02|Will you not claim there was no honor in fighting a wench?
Geralt|No. I'd expect to hear that from someone who was afraid to lose to a woman.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|You've Colossus and Mancomb left to face. With that duo defeated, you can seek out the Maestro.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Look for Colossus in the largest courtyard you can find in San Sebastian. While Mancomb you will find wandering about the docks south of Hauteville.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Now only Colossus stands between you and a chance at the Maestro. Saint Sebastian - that's where you should go. Look for the largest courtyard.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Only Mancomb remains. You should look for him by the docks south of Hauteville. Once you've bested him, you can try your strength against the Maestro.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|A good fight, a sound fight. One that's earned you the right to challenge the Maestro. You've only dishonor to gain should you back out now.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|You'll find the Maestro by the docks.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Still Waters handily defeats the witcher! The titan remains undefeated, his vow of silence still very much in force!
Toussaint Bard Woman 02|You fight with honor. I must give you that.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|A robust fight with a most surprising finish…! A lady-knight! Who's ever heard of such a thing?
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Incredible! The witcher has parried Colossus' blows! No one's ever managed that feat!
Toussaint Bandit Strong 03|Here's your due.
Geralt|Thanks.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Now to face the Maestro, all you've left are rumbles with Mancomb and the knight known as Still Waters.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Seek out the knight in the heart of Hauteville, near Mountebank Alley. Whereas Mancomb loiters about the docks south of that district.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Only Mancomb now stands between you and your duel with the Maestro. Look for him by the docks south of Hauteville.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Only one combatant remains - the knight known as Still Waters. Defeat him, and you will gain the right to challenge the Maestro. Look for the knight in Hauteville, near Mountebank Alley.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|You've earned my esteem, sir. We've not seen such a feat in years. And thus you've secured the right to challenge the Maestro himself. You'll find him by the docks.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|The witcher defeats Colossus in a regulation bout. A captivating clash to say the least!
Toussaint Bandit Strong 03|You thump hard, you thump well, master witcher.
Geralt|Thanks.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|The witcher proved unable to deflect Colossus' blows.
Toussaint Bandit Strong 03|As was easy to predict. If you're ever in the mood for another clobbering, stop by.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|The witcher withered beneath Colossus' stature.
Toussaint Bandit Strong 03|You should've agreed just to parry. Better luck next time, maybe. Though I doubt it will help much.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Whoa! Bad form! You were solely to deflect his blows - you agreed! Yet here you come a-pummeling! The fight is over!
Toussaint Bandit Strong 03|Well, well. You're quick. Gray tufts and all.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|I would not have stacked my coin in your favor, witcher… You simply lack the look of a pugilist.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|This where I find the boxer they call the Maestro?
Toussaint Noble Man 11|Maestro, Champ, The Undefeated - folk call him many things. You are the witcher who dropped the three lesser champions?
Geralt|I am. Come to fight the Maestro, but seems to me he's… indisposed.
Toussaint Noble Man 11|Alcohol is the Maestro's remedy for his crippling shyness. He's a delicate man, you see? He'd never so much as hit a pillow while sober.
Drunken Master|Fighting sober's like dancing to silence.
Geralt|Let's go. I challenge you.
Drunken Master|Hold on! Whoooooa! I'm a man of principle, I keep to a code. I don't tinkle where I eat, and I don't fight folk who don't drink.
Geralt|Meaning?
Drunken Master|Meaning you're to drink - or hey-diddle-diddle out of here.
Geralt|Sheesh. Fine.
Toussaint Noble Man 11|Mesdames! Messieurs! The Maestro will perform! At last!
Geralt|Let's do this.
Geralt|Not in the mood right now. So long.
Geralt|Forget fighting. Sure you can stand? You're blind drunk.
Drunken Master|Not your bumbopping business! Ugh! You chit, you chat, while my vodka's gone flat. Will you fight - yea or nay?
Drunken Master|So? Ready to rattle? You know the rules. Drink or get the feck out.
<|endoftext|>
Drunken Master|You fought well. Not near as well as I did, of course. My advice? Drink. Then drink more. Inadequate intoxication - that is clearly your problem.
Geralt|Mhm. We'll see next time.
Drunken Master|Oh, you scamp! You beat me. It's not happened in years! Your fists, they're… glorious.
Geralt|Thanks.
Drunken Master|I'm gob smacked, I am, I've to drink it off. Ooff! Good fight! To speak true, I'm pleased you stripped me of the title. I shall have more time to pursue my chief interest, now.
Toussaint Noble Man 11|Witcher Geralt of Rivia is hereby crowned Fisticuffs Champion of Beauclair! Bravo!
Toussaint Noble Man 11|Behold, your trophy.
Drunken Master|A life without liquor's like loving without licking.
Drunken Master|One thing I've learned - a man thumps like he drinks!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|So long.
Geralt|Cantarella - who is she, really? She mentioned you knew each other.
Fringilla Vigo|You ran into her? Her real name is Carthia van Canten, Assire's former collaborator. She's very… talented.
Geralt|Spied for you?
Fringilla Vigo|Not just for us, probably. I doubt she wishes any harm upon me or other sorceresses, but one must be very careful what one says in her presence.
Geralt|Seemed like you'd told her quite a lot about me.
Fringilla Vigo|You ought to feel flattered, then. That makes you famous on both banks of the Yaruga.
Geralt|You look good.
Fringilla Vigo|For a captive of Emhyr - is that what you mean?
Geralt|Seems like he's shown you surprising… leniency. No interrogations, no torture. Or did you just tell him everything he wanted to know?
Fringilla Vigo|If I'd told him everything, he'd hardly still need me alive, wouldn't you say?
Fringilla Vigo|Anyway, we shan't speak of it. I and what concerns me have not been a concern of yours for some time now.
Fringilla Vigo|Yes, Geralt?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Someone placed an illusion here.
Geralt|Nehaleni's Eye - oughta use it.
Geralt|Hm… Something here. Where's that artifact Keira gave me?
Geralt|There's something here. Need to use the Eye.
Geralt|An illusion.
Geralt|Calm down, Roach.
Geralt|There, there.
Geralt|Eeeasy.
Geralt|Everything's all right.
Geralt|Now, now.
Geralt|Go! Go!
Geralt|Hey-yah!
Geralt|Run, Roach!
Geralt|Giddy-up!
Geralt|Faster!
Geralt|Whoaa!
Geralt|Whoa there, Roach.
Geralt|Slow, now.
Geralt|Take it easy.
Geralt|Prrrrrr.
Geralt|Slower.
Geralt|Come on, now…
Geralt|Not so fast, Roach.
Geralt|Slow now, whoa.
Geralt|Hey there.
Geralt|C'mon, Roach!
Geralt|C'mon!
Geralt|Let's go!
Geralt|Move it!
Geralt|That's it, Roach!
Geralt|Good size. Wonder if this piece of rot'll get me anything.
Geralt|Might be a bounty for bringing in the trophy.
Geralt|Maybe there's a bounty? Need a trophy.
Geralt|Someone'll pay for this trophy. No doubt about it.
Geralt|Trail's fresh…
Geralt|Hm… Definitely came through here.
Geralt|Went this way.
Geralt|Another track.
Geralt|Blood hasn't even dried.
Geralt|Hm. Might wanna look around some.
Geralt|This is someone's home. Or something's.
Geralt|Another victim.
Geralt|Wasn't a fair fight. Didn't stand a chance.
Geralt|Ground's splattered with blood for a few feet around. A lot of it.
Geralt|Can't go this way. Gotta find another route.
Geralt|Hm… Strange.
Geralt|Interesting.
Geralt|Wonder what this means…
Geralt|Bad idea.
Geralt|C'mon, come closer.
Geralt|Argh!
Geralt|Ugh!
Geralt|Well, c'mon!
Geralt|You'll never learn.
Geralt|Shit!
Geralt|Not your lucky day.
Geralt|Mistake.
Geralt|Let's end this.
Geralt|It's clearing up.
Geralt|Looks like rain.
Geralt|A storm, dammit.
Geralt|Wind's howling.
Geralt|Ugh. Now snow.
Geralt|Gotten cold.
Geralt|Pretty damn hot.
Geralt|Storm's coming.
Geralt|Raining again…
Geralt|Medallion's humming. Place of Power, it's gotta be.
Geralt|Place of Power. Should draw from it.
Geralt|Hm, magic… A Place of Power.
Geralt|Shit.
Geralt|Dammit.
Geralt|Dammit.
Geralt|Just wonderful.
Geralt|Great.
Geralt|Strange place. Keira's lamp worth a try?
Geralt|Hm… Magic lamp's worth a try here.
Geralt|Let’s try Keira's lamp.
Geralt|Clear magic lamp situation. I'll have to remember to thank Keira.
Geralt|Magic lamp - that's what I need to use.
Geralt|Damn, you're ugly.
Geralt|Come on.
Geralt|Dammit!
Geralt|Not bad.
Geralt|What now, you piece of filth?
Geralt|Die.
Geralt|Time to end this.
Geralt|Ugh!
Geralt|Ehh!
Geralt|Argh!
Geralt|Gotta blow this up if I want to get rid of the endregas.
Geralt|Harpies got their nest here.
Geralt|Ghoul nest. Oughta just destroy it.
Geralt|Draconid nest. Need to destroy it.
Geralt|Drowners're coming out of there. Best blow it up.
Geralt|Dead. Just dead.
Geralt|Nekkers surface here. Dig their way out.
Geralt|Rotfiend nest. Needs to be destroyed.
Geralt|Siren den. Gotta ruin it for them.
Geralt|Wyverns lay their eggs here. Gotta be destroyed.
Geralt|Monster nest. Best destroyed with a Dancing Star or Grapeshot.
Geralt|A letter.
Geralt|Nothing interesting.
Geralt|Nothing here.
Geralt|Perfect weather for a voyage.
Geralt|Hmm… Turn back or go forth?
Geralt|Time to move on.
Geralt|Argh, could use a portal about now.
Geralt|Hm. Long way…
Geralt|I'm too old for treks that long.
Geralt|Any shortcuts?
Geralt|Long trek…
Geralt|Miles and miles and miles…
Geralt|A long trek requires a fellowship. Oughta cobble one together.
Geralt|Damn. Got a feeling I'm forgetting about something.
Geralt|Should glance at the map…
Geralt|Maybe oughta turn around?
Geralt|Argh, could use Triss with one of her portals.
Geralt|Let's go.
Geralt|Hm. Might wanna look at the map…
Geralt|Ugh, I'm too old to wander the world.
Geralt|That's a chunk of distance.
Geralt|Too far afield, this…
Geralt|The women'll be restless.
Geralt|Argh, could use Yennefer and one of her portals.
Geralt|Hm. Nothing interesting here.
Geralt|Akh kha akh…
Geralt|Easy. Easy!
Geralt|Stop. Enough.
Geralt|You oughta be spooking them. C'mon!
Geralt|All over now.
Geralt|Hey… It's nothing, it's fine.
Geralt|Whooaaa, devil's spawn.
Geralt|Slow it down.
Geralt|What the hell's gotten into you? Slower.
Geralt|Take a rest, now.
Geralt|Whoooaaaa! Slow down!
Geralt|Where's the fire? Ease up.
Geralt|Nice and slow, now.
Geralt|Whoaa…!
Geralt|Now run! Fast!
Geralt|Show me whatcha got!
Geralt|Yaa, yaa! Faster, faster!
Geralt|Giddy-up! Haa!
Geralt|Come on!
Geralt|Full speed ahead!
Geralt|Rraa! Go on!
Geralt|Yee-haah!
Geralt|Get going!
Geralt|Gimme it all!
Geralt|Let's dance.
Geralt|Any last words?
Geralt|Givin' me no choice.
Geralt|Not too late to surrender.
Geralt|Pathetic.
Geralt|Shut up and fight.
Geralt|That's enough of that.
Geralt|Time to end this.
Geralt|Ugh… that stench.
Geralt|How you like that silver?
Geralt|Show me what you got.
Geralt|Ugly bastard…
Geralt|Damn…
Geralt|Not good.
Geralt|What? Lost your nerve?
Geralt|Well, how long you gonna make me wait?
Geralt|Arachnomorph nest. Should destroy it. Bomb oughta do.
Geralt|Dammit, arachnomorph nest. Need to destroy it.
Geralt|Gonna hang your head from my saddle.
Geralt|Ever fight a witcher?
Geralt|Archespores'll sprout again. Should destroy the area if I wanna get rid of them for good.
Geralt|Kikimore breeding ground. Gotta destroy it if they're to disappear for good.
Geralt|Giant centipede spawning ground. Should destroy it.
Geralt|Hasta la vista!
Geralt|That's better.
Geralt|A bit more light could be useful.
Geralt|Can finally see something.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Could use a few potion ingredients. Show me what you got.
Geralt|Folk from the village come here often?
Guslar|Oooh, when help they need, the pellar they seek.
Geralt|Help with what?
Guslar|With the dead that come a-haunting, peace must be made. But they must then wait for Forefathers' Eve.
Guslar|Or when an evil spirit runs wild in a homestead. Drive the spirit off, the pellar can.
Geralt|And if I needed, say, a love potion?
Guslar|Then to the witch you would be sent. Not a matter for the pellar, that.
Geralt|So long.
Guslar|White Wolf, wise wolf. What is it the wolf needs?
Guslar|After what you have done, witcher, you dare to the pellar come?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What do you have on offer?
Hattori|Redanian dumplings, speciality of the house! Heartily recommended!
Hattori|Blimey! A vatt'ghern in my establishment? It can't be!
Geralt|How do you know I'm a witcher?
Hattori|Are you joking? Silver blades - who else uses them? Crafted in Mahakam, am I right? Must be about forty inches long?
Geralt|Forty and a half. Still impressed. You're something of an expert, evidently.
Hattori|I'm Éibhear Hattori, former master swordsmith, currently a master of dumplings.
Geralt|Geralt of Rivia.
Hattori|A pleasure, Geralt. How might I help you? Care to try a dumpling?
Geralt|Mmm. Tasty.
Hattori|Hm, glad to hear it. Anything else I can do for you?
Geralt|Thanks, not really hungry.
Hattori|The customer is king.
Geralt|So long.
Geralt|An elven sword expert. You must be Éibhear Hattori.
Hattori|Ah, indeed. I am.
Geralt|Geralt of Rivia. Heard a lot of good things about you.
Geralt|Greetings. How's business?
Hattori|Welcome back. And thank you… not bad. How may I be of help? Care for a dumpling?
Geralt|Greetings, Éibhear.
Hattori|Geralt! You return safe and sound!
Geralt|I do. You doing all right?
Hattori|Never better! Once van Hoorn had finally left, Cleaver lost interest in swordsmiths. I can forge swords again without fear of my workshop going up in flames.
Geralt|Glad to hear it.
Hattori|You've no notion how glad I am! I've no need of Sukrus anymore and can devote myself to what I truly love. I thank you, witcher.
Geralt|My sword ready yet?
Hattori|Not quite. Come back later?
Hattori|It is. Behold and admire. A sword to outshine all others!
Geralt|Well, this was worth the wait. Thank you, Éibhear.
Hattori|It is I who thank you. For everything.
Geralt|So, now can you craft me something extraordinary?
Hattori|Naturally. It is what we agreed. Give me a few days, then come by for your new sword.
Geralt|Listen, would you craft something for me?
Geralt|What do you have on offer?
Geralt|Greetings, Éibhear.
Hattori|Greetings, Geralt. How might I be of help?

Geralt|Got another voyage in mind?
Hjalmar|Course. Ice Giant was just the beginnin'. 'Sides, got all kinds of whoresons already sayin' he wasn't that big.
Geralt|What about the folk of Undvik? You and your men were gonna help them return to their isle and rebuild Urskar.
Hjalmar|Cerys'll take care of that.
Geralt|Figured out who brought the berserkers to Kaer Trolde?
Hjalmar|Nay. If I'm to be honest, I was kinda countin' on Cerys findin' some lead… but she's had no luck.
Hjalmar|But we tracked them down, took care of 'em - and that's most important. Any foes o' Clan an Craite will think twice now afore they pick a fight.
Geralt|You and Cerys getting along?
Hjalmar|Argh, as ever - daggers drawn and at loggerheads. Must look somethin' nasty from the side, but all in all, I love my sis.
Geralt|So her becoming queen of all Skellige - it's changed nothing?
Hjalmar|Tried to give me one or two orders, but I do believe she's done with that now.
Geralt|So, you becoming ruler of all Skellige - it's changed nothing?
Hjalmar|That is no argument to me sis.
Geralt|You and Ciri - as I remember, you two grew up together, at least for a while…
Hjalmar|Aye, spent half her childhood in the Isles. Always at my heels, she was. Scrawny wee thing…
Hjalmar|But her leaps on ice skates - why, none of us could rival them. Tried to outdo her once, smashed me mouth on a rock.
Geralt|And then you went to Crach and announced you'd agreed to wed.
Hjalmar|You hear of that? Aye, we had twelve winters on us, both. Any thought of continuin' that romance - me da whipped it out of me head. Hahahah.
Hjalmar|Wonder what it'd be like to see her now.
Geralt|Farewell, an Craite.
Hjalmar|Ah, Geralt, how're things?
<|endoftext|>
Baron Bandit Weak 03|Ah. Finally here. Rules are simple. Choose who you're gonna run against, make your wager, then ride to Blackbough and back. First's the winner, second's a bleedin' cunt. Got it?
Baron Bandit Weak 03|So who you gonna race? Stutterin' M-m-matko? Iron-Arse Hans? Or Black Bogdan?
Geralt|I'll take Stuttering Matt.
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Y-y-y-y-you'll s-s-s-see I-i-i-i-i'll b-b-b-b-b-b-b… ehhh, fuck it.
Baron Bandit Weak 03|C'mon, let's set the wager… and get racin'.
Geralt|Let's see how that iron arse holds up. C'mon, Hans.
Baron Bandit Strong 02|Spent half my life on horseback. Other half on the backs of ponies. You can't beat me.
Geralt|Ride against Black Bogdan this time.
Baron Bandit Strong 03|Take you for a ride, all right.
Geralt|Changed my mind, don't really wanna race. Have fun without me, gents.
Baron Bandit Weak 03|Good day, Gray One.
<|endoftext|>
Baron Bandit Strong 01|C-c-c-c-came t-t-t-o r-r-r-race, not ch-ch-ch-atter.
Baron Bandit Strong 02|I'm not much for talkin'. But put me on a horse… whoo, watch me run!
Baron Bandit Strong 03|Talk to Radko. He's the one sets the races.
Baron Bandit Weak 03|All right, who else is racin'?
Baron Bandit Weak 03|Mount up!
Baron Bandit Weak 03|Goooo!
Baron Bandit Strong 01|G-g-g-gee u-u-up!
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Ou-ou-outta the w-w-way, m-m-maggots! M-m-matko's c-c-comin'!
Baron Bandit Strong 02|Faster, Beecher, faster! Got a ripe apple for you when we're through!
Baron Bandit Strong 02|Yeeeeh-haaah!
Baron Bandit Strong 03|Oi, witcher! Your mum not want you?
Baron Bandit Strong 03|I'll be first, if I have to skewer my mare with my spurs!
Geralt|Dammit!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Can I have a word?
Skellige Priestess 03|I serve the goddess and her flock. What can I help you with?
Geralt|You Svana? Here about the Heroes' Pursuits.
Geralt|Can outsiders sign up, or is this a closed event?
Skellige Priestess 03|Freya sees no insiders, no outsiders. Any man can pay her tribute by risking his life in the Pursuits.
Skellige Priestess 03|Our races differ from those on the Continent. We are beholden to one rule alone - first across the line wins. Sometimes he's the swiftest. Other times, it is the one who knocks his opponents off their mounts.
Geralt|Explains the name… There an entry fee?
Skellige Priestess 03|Courage. If you do not lack it, hang a horseshoe.
Geralt|Bit of exercise never killed anyone… So, where're the races held?
Skellige Priestess 03|The first three on Ard Skellig. Whoever wins each at least once returns here to Hindarsfjall to face last year's best rider in a final pursuit.
Geralt|Gotcha. What's his name?
Skellige Priestess 03|You mean, hers. Astrid of Spikeroog, known as the Vipress.
Geralt|Lovely as monickers go.
Skellige Priestess 03|And completely deserved… Good luck, witcher. May your deeds bring the goddess pleasure.
Geralt|Winner get a reward of any kind?
Skellige Priestess 03|He covers himself in glory, basks in proof of his valor.
Geralt|Mhm. Was hoping for something a little more… tangible.
Skellige Priestess 03|To us such things matter least… But yes, the winner receives something to remind him of his feat. At times it is a sword, at others a helmet or a shield.
Geralt|How about that. See, you can be practical if you want to.
Geralt|Don't lack courage. Time, though, that's another matter… Still might come back. Take care.
Geralt|What's with the horseshoes?
Skellige Priestess 03|Those who wish to race in the Heroes' Pursuits hang them there.
Geralt|That a series of races? Hmm…
Geralt|Nothing at the moment. Farewell.
Skellige Priestess 03|How might I serve you?
Skellige Priestess 03|So, witcher? Will you dare take part in the Heroes' Pursuits?
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Warrior 02|Who else will race? Who will ride for the glory of the goddess?
Skellige Villager 01|A foreigner in the Heroes' Pursuits… Don't know that I like that.
Skellige Villager 02|Then save your whingin' till you figure it out.
Skellige Warrior 02|The goddess watch over you. Or grant you a beautiful death!
Skellige Villager 01|Go on, Rikka! Show 'em!
Skellige Woman 05|You ride like a woman!
Skellige Warrior 01|Won't let you win, vagrant! Can't!
Skellige Woman 05|Yeeeehaaaaa!
Skellige Warrior 01|Haaaaah! First!
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Warrior 01|Who dares join Bald Sigge and Aegir Fishbreath in the Heroes' Pursuit?
Skellige Villager 01|Ye can do it, Aegir! Bolt off the mark and never look back!
Skellige Woman 01|Cut your horse's hide, that'll get its hooves movin'!
Skellige Warrior 01|Horses're antsy… All of you ready?
Skellige Villager 01|They're off! Faster, faster!
Skellige Fisherman 04|Hahaha!
Skellige Warrior 02|That all you got?! Can't ye go any faster?!
Skellige Fisherman 04|I won! I won!
Skellige Warrior 02|Who won?! Huh?! Who?! Bald Sigge, that's who!
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Warrior 03|No other willin'? What, are you all afraid? Nothin' to fear! Bones heal and skin scars over!
Skellige Villager 01|Remember last year - Yove and his horse flyin' right off that cliff?
Skellige Woman 05|Aye, aye… Lad died young. 'Twere somethin' beautiful, though.
Skellige Warrior 03|Grab your bridles and hang on to your saddles!
Skellige Villager 01|Ride on! For Freya!
Skellige Warrior 02|Keep your distance, vagrant!
Skellige Villager 06|No one can outrace Speedy Osvald!
Skellige Warrior 02|Hahaha! I won!
Skellige Villager 06|Hahaaaa! First again!
Geralt|Damn!
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Priestess 03|Geralt of Rivia… I've been awaiting you.
Skellige Villager 01|Show 'im, Astrid! We believe in ye, lass!
Skellige Woman 05|The vipress'll swallow the wolf!
Skellige Priestess 03|Go on! Ride swifter than the wind and the goddess' own chariot!
Skellige Villager 01|They're off! They're off!
Skellige Woman 01|Out of the way! Or I'll kill ye!
Skellige Woman 01|Grrr!
Skellige Woman 03|Hahahahaha! I won! Second year in a row!
Skellige Woman 01|Keep your distance, drifter!
Skellige Woman 01|Hahahaha! I won!

Geralt|Gotta say I like the place.
Jonas|I should hope so. Found it a ruin when I came here from Undvik. Gulls shittin' into the tankards through the gaps in the thatch. I bought the hut, rolled up my sleeves and made a proper alehouse out of it.
Geralt|Why'd you call it "The New Port"?
Jonas|Continuity. Owned "The Old Port" on Undvik. A few of my former customers come here evenin's to reminisce about the old times.
Geralt|What smells so delicious?
Geralt|Actually, kinda in the mood for cards. Care for a round of gwent?
Jonas|I'm always in the mood for gwent.
Geralt|Thanks for sparing a moment.
Geralt|Greetings, I'm Geralt.
Jonas|The witcher known as the White Wolf, I know. They tell stories about you every day 'round here. Lookin' for an open seat at the table?
Geralt|I'll be fine. Just wanted to talk.
Jonas|Greetings, welcome.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|I don't often raise such a hubbub. You must rarely get guests from the Continent.
Jorund|Aye, true. When a Redanian or a Temerian grows the stones to come to Skellige, they usually go ashore at Kaer Trolde.
Jorund|Port's good there, merchants aplenty… and the jarl's right merciful to Continentals.
Geralt|Those two boys, the pesky ones… who were they?
Jorund|Kori and Kraki. Only ever troublesome. As is their father, Leif.
Geralt|He… interesting in some way?
Jorund|Depends… If it's liars and cowards that interest you, then very much so.
Geralt|So long.
Jorund|Aye, Geralt?
Jorund|If you're lookin' for a drinkin' companion, you've chosen well. If it's work you want - likewise. There's a monster needs slayin'.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Keira Metz deep in the heart of Velen… Thought you hated the countryside.
Keira Metz|I can assure you I do, now more than ever.
Geralt|Heard a witch lived out here. Never would've guessed it was King Foltest's former advisor.
Keira Metz|I'm so pleased the world's still able to astound you, Geralt. I actually envy you that sense of wonder - common in children, knights errant, and morons.
Geralt|Hm, someone's grown irritable. Is that any way to greet an old friend?
Keira Metz|I believe I "greeted you" with a pleasant view. Now tell me what brings you here.
Geralt|I'm looking for a certain young woman.
Keira Metz|Oh really. Who?
Geralt|I'm looking for Ciri. That Ciri. And no one can know. Understand?
Keira Metz|Cirilla is here? The girl once sought by the Lodge of Sorceresses and practically every ruler on the Continent has landed here, in Velen, and I know nothing of it? What is she doing here?
Geralt|Indications are she's hiding from someone. I heard she quarreled with a witch, but if you don't know anything…
Geralt|Sure you haven't seen her?
Keira Metz|I'm certain I haven't. But recently someone asked me about an ashen-haired woman. He claimed she would stand out from the peasant crowd.
Geralt|Who was it?
Keira Metz|Not so fast, Geralt. No humble plea? No offering for the witch?
Geralt|What's your rate these days? A couple dozen eggs? Three hens, maybe?
Keira Metz|My rate rises with every word you speak. I'm not sure you can afford the information anymore.
Geralt|Hm, you're pricklier than I remembered. Isn't living in nature's lap supposed to be cleansing, calming…?
Keira Metz|Nature stinks.
Keira Metz|Oh, sod it, don't give me that look. I know it's Ciri we're talking about.
Keira Metz|It was an elf - this individual who asked about Cirilla. No flea-bitten Scoia'tael slob, either, but an elven mage.
Geralt|He leave any message for her?
Keira Metz|No, but he asked that were I to meet her, I should lead her to him.
Geralt|So you know where to find him?
Keira Metz|Yes, he said he'd found a hideout in some elven ruins near the village of Midcopse. I'll go there with you.
Geralt|Why? Think I'll have trouble finding this place?
Keira Metz|I've unfinished business with this elf. He promised me something, but he never delivered it.
Keira Metz|Besides, I know you think as I do - that she might be there. And I'd like to see Cirilla, too.
Geralt|Let's go, then.
Keira Metz|Yes, let's.
Geralt|Can't go just yet.
Keira Metz|In that case we'll meet there. I'll await you near the cave entrance.
Geralt|He say what his name was?
Keira Metz|He didn't. And he wore a mask. Very secretive all around, but… I liked him. He was intelligent and composed.
Geralt|He say what he wanted with Ciri?
Keira Metz|Only that they were to meet in Velen. He wished to know if she'd arrived before he did.
Geralt|Ciri visited Skellige earlier. She was travelling with a mage… This elf, most probably.
Keira Metz|The girl crossed half the world to get here… Care to tell me what this is about?
Geralt|Wish I knew.
Geralt|What was an elven mage doing in Velen?
Keira Metz|Well, I tried to ask him, of course, about everything…
Geralt|Of course.
Keira Metz|But you know how elves are - he asked many more questions than he answered.
Geralt|My undying gratitude. Good enough?
Keira Metz|It's nothing to sneeze at, but you've a knack for getting into trouble. I should probably ask for something more immediately deliverable.
Geralt|He say anything else about her?
Geralt|Apparently, she quarreled with the local witch.
Keira Metz|Pff. Someone's been feeding you horseshit. The girls around here are too stupid to quarrel with me.
Geralt|She's not from here.
Keira Metz|You're up to something, Geralt. If I'm to help you, you must tell me what's going on. Who are you looking for?
Geralt|Ciri.
Keira Metz|Ciri? Well… now I understand the secrecy, not to mention the brooding, the furled brow. And you say she had some sort of problem with a witch?
Geralt|So you haven't seen her.
Geralt|So, betcha saw this question coming: what are you doing here?
Keira Metz|Let me think… Enjoying the country air? Admiring the unspoilt scenery? Or is it furthering the age-old alliance between the city and its breadbasket. No.
Keira Metz|I'm in hiding, Geralt. Blind to the state of the world? Don't you see what's happening?
Geralt|Mean the persecution mages now face?
Keira Metz|Yes, that's exactly what I mean - Radovid's new pastime, pursuing anyone with a whiff of magic about them.
Keira Metz|Witch hunters - sound familiar? Murderers scouring the North from end to end. Burning books, hanging soothsayers, torturing herbalists…
Geralt|Changing the subject…
Geralt|Picked a strange place to hide.
Keira Metz|I didn't pick anything. In the North, Radovid's men hunt sorceresses like fish in a barrel. Nilfgaard controls the south. Where was I to flee?
Geralt|Emperor does keep mages on a short leash, but he lets them live and ply their trade.
Keira Metz|Radovid and Emhyr differ in every respect except one: They share a deep hatred of the Lodge of Sorceresses. And I was a member.
Geralt|So how's it feel to be the village witch?
Keira Metz|Huh. Horrid.
Geralt|No joy in having the boundless respect and trust of the local peasantry?
Keira Metz|They'd respect anyone who could produce hemorrhoid cream.
Geralt|Been here a while, haven't you?
Keira Metz|Long enough for rot to set in. You cannot possibly imagine how much I detest this place.
Geralt|Any news of your sisters from the Lodge?
Keira Metz|None. We can't know too much about one another these days. It's safer that way.
Geralt|Even tried to contact one another?
Keira Metz|I've wanted to many times. But I've no way of knowing who would answer - or who might be listening.
Geralt|See you, Keira.
Geralt|Missed a spot.
Keira Metz|Where?
Keira Metz|Hope you didn't come to gawk.
Geralt|No. To talk.
Keira Metz|Turn around and wait.
Keira Metz|Geralt! Just when I was starting to miss you!
Geralt|Why'd you want the lamp?
Keira Metz|You just witnessed why. To communicate with lost souls.
Geralt|Didn't know you were interested in that kind of magic.
Keira Metz|There's nothing wrong with it.
Geralt|Mhm. Why'd the elf promise you the lamp?
Keira Metz|We traded for it. He needed powerful magic and sensed I was no common wart charmer.
Keira Metz|I brewed him a potion. To delay nervous tissue degeneration, stave off memory loss, or some such.
Geralt|Who'd he want to use it on?
Keira Metz|He didn't say…
Geralt|Tell me more about this mage from the isle. Were you two… close?
Keira Metz|Never expected you'd take such an interest in my private life.
Geralt|More interested to know if you bonded, as fellow magic practitioners.
Keira Metz|Well, we had little in common in that arena. Alexander was one of those anxious experimenters, forever short on sleep. The kind that thinks perfect happiness is an isolated tower and a full set of vials and alembics.
Geralt|Bet the old witch who lived here left you a bunch of interesting sundries.
Keira Metz|She did indeed. I gather you'd like a look?
Geralt|Very much so.
Geralt|Keira?
Keira Metz|What are you doing here?
Verden Ghost Peasant 03|…but nay, the mage, he says, "Bring me rats! An' healthy ones! Not somethin' the cat dragged in."
Geralt|What's this? What's he saying about rats?
Keira Metz|It's no concern of yours.
Geralt|Manage to find the lamp?
Keira Metz|Yes. And you? Come to ask my help again?
Geralt|No. But if there's anything I could do for you…
Keira Metz|Hmm…
Geralt|So there is something.
Keira Metz|Hmm… indeed. I do have this small favor to ask of you.
Geralt|Hope you're not mad at me…
Keira Metz|Oh, of course not. I understand perfectly well that you had valid, important reasons for leaving me in an underground cavern all by myself.
Geralt|Keira? What're you doing?
Keira Metz|Geralt! You gave me quite a start!
Verden Ghost Peasant 03|…but nay, the mage, he says, "Bring me rats! An' healthy ones! Not somethin' the cat dragged in."
Geralt|This the lamp from the elf's hideout? And what's this about rats?
Keira Metz|Nothing important, I'll explain later. Now tell me - to what do I owe the pleasure?
Geralt|Are you and Lambert…?
Keira Metz|Did you think yourself the only witcher a sorceress could possibly take an interest in?
Geralt|You know, you two are actually a great match.
Keira Metz|You think so? Thank you.
<|endoftext|>
Keira Metz|Forgive me, but I'm not at all impressed.
Keira Metz|Hahahaha! Don't make me laugh!
Keira Metz|Have a taste!
Keira Metz|And now, something special!
Keira Metz|You were foolish to cross me!
Keira Metz|You'll regret that!
Keira Metz|Geralt, look.
Keira Metz|Here's something.
Keira Metz|Well?
Keira Metz|Argh!
Keira Metz|Perish!
Keira Metz|Ann Gal Scam'Hanach!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Can we talk?
Lambert|What about?
Geralt|Nice to be together again, wouldn't you say?
Lambert|Mhm. Just missing Ciri.
Geralt|Thanks for reminding me.
Lambert|I had to change the subject. Heard a sentimental sob making its way up from your gut. Any idea why she's returned?
Geralt|Hhh, shortest version… she's running from the Wild Hunt.
Lambert|Woo. Damn.
Lambert|Going gets tough and you need help, you can count on me.
Geralt|Try not to get into any arguments, can you? They've all come here to help.
Lambert|Gonna tell me how to behave, now?
Geralt|No. Just asking you nicely.
Lambert|How's this for a nice answer: kiss my ass. Sheesh.
Geralt|Holding up all right?
Lambert|Love questions like that. Am I holding up? What? My dick? This is shit, Geralt, and you know it.
Lambert|Knew the old man couldn't live forever. Huh, even told Eskel that when it came time, I'd get his sword. Fits my hand perfectly, you know.
Lambert|But… Vesemir deserved a better death. Whereas he died like a louse - crushed.
Geralt|We'll avenge him.
Lambert|Doesn't look that rosy to me.
Geralt|You haven't changed a lick.
Lambert|That disappointment I hear?
Geralt|No. Surprise, maybe. Most grow gentler with age. Seems you're growing pricklier.
Lambert|Mom always said I was different.
Geralt|Had some other adjectives in mind, but… different'll do.
Geralt|See you later.
Lambert|Yeah, take care.
<|endoftext|>
Lambert|Aaaargh!
Lambert|You're slow. Too slow.
Lambert|Had enough?
Lambert|Geralt?
Lambert|Give it a rest, Wolf.
Lambert|Pwhooaa!
Lambert|Come on.
Lambert|Not bad.
Lambert|Not now.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Got a minute?
Letho|What is it?
Geralt|How much did you pay the arbalist? You know, the one who "killed you"?
Letho|Not one crown. I found out there was a Ben of Kovir in Vester's band of merry men.
Letho|See, a while ago I met Ben's father, saved his life. He was a master archer from Kovir. And I'd heard Ben took after his father in that respect.
Letho|So I contacted him. We decided that if Vester ever tracked me down, Ben'd shoot me before any real fightin' broke out.
Geralt|Risky as plans go.
Letho|Is it? Only thing I feared was someone besides Ben wanting to check if I was really dead. Or make sure I was by bashin' my skull in. But a bit of fear's a small price to pay for freedom.
Geralt|See you.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Can we talk? I'm…
Lugos The Mad|I know who you are, Geralt of Rivia. I'm Lugos. Madman's what many call me. Jarl of Clan Drummond's what I am.
Geralt|Your son did well in the Cave of Dreams.
Lugos The Mad|Why even tell me this?
Geralt|Well, got reason to believe you underestimate him.
Lugos The Mad|What? Did he whine to you? Oh, the shame! When I see him I'll--
Geralt|He didn't say anything. It's just… well, it's plain obvious.
Geralt|Two clans on one island… tough to be neighbors, so near each other?
Lugos The Mad|A neighbor is one who lives nearby, not one who stole half your home. The an Craite seized our lands.
Geralt|In the days of Harald the Cripple. That was three centuries ago.
Lugos The Mad|Doesn't change the fact they had no right. I'll rid Ard Skellig of Crach and his brood yet.
Geralt|Just out of curiosity, why do they call you "Madman"?
Lugos The Mad|WAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!!
Lugos The Mad|That's why.
Geralt|Farewell, Lugos.
Lugos The Mad|Well? What is it?
Lugos The Mad|Go see your friend Crach if you wanna talk.
<|endoftext|>
Liam|For four generations! That is how long my family has been producing wine.
Mathilda|Producing plonk unfit to drink, you mean. Which is exactly why you should sell Belgaard to me, not him.
Beauclair Clerk 01|Ahem, as a ducal clerk, I must look after the duchy's best interests. Belgaard currently belongs to the treasury.
Beauclair Clerk 01|The minister of the treasury has clearly expressed his desire that Belgaard be handed over to a responsible steward. Yet diverse troubles beset both your present holdings. Until you resolve them and thus prove yourselves competent, selling Belgaard to either of you is out of the question.
Mathilda|Well? Happy? This is your fault!
Liam|Mine? You're deranged, woman!
Liam|Hark! Good folk! Be it known Matilda de Vermentino is a cursed, spiteful lunatic!
Geralt|Doesn't look cursed to me. Just really, really angry. Ticked her off quite a bit, you have…
Liam|Truly? How would you know? A shrew-tamer, are you?
Geralt|A witcher. So no expert, I guess, but it doesn't take an expert to see when a woman's angry.
Liam|Heheh, I suppose you speak the truth, brother. Wait, did you say witcher?
Liam|Not seeking work, are you? You see, I wish to buy a vineyard - Belgaard. Yet that bloody bureaucrat's not likely to sell it to me until I settle my troubles at home, at Coronata.
Geralt|What kind of troubles we talking about?
Liam|Ehh, it's botched, in more ways than one. The herbarium - infested with monsters. My steward - gone missing, with an entire transport of wine. And someone's abducted my herbalist…
Geralt|Lotta bad luck for one little vineyard.
Liam|If you ask me, it's that… Matilda. Her handiwork. A sugar-sweet face, a temper sharp as horseradish. So, will you help?
Geralt|Sure sounds like work for a witcher. Yeah, I'll help.
Liam|I am really, truly grateful. Thank you.
Liam|My vineyard lies east of here. You're sure to find it. Now forgive me, I must talk to that quill-pusher. I might win him over yet.
Mathilda|Pssst! You're a witcher, yes? I heard you talking to that oafish ogre Liam. Disgusting man, the worst sort. First seduces with the dashing gaze, the fair face, then reveals a coal-black heart.
Mathilda|But that's all beside the point. I stopped you because I want to buy Belgaard, too. Alas, things are rotten at my own vineyard, Vermentino.
Geralt|Hm. Strange coincidence…
Mathilda|No coincidence - I am certain Liam's thrown a stick in my spokes. Several sticks.
Mathilda|My cooper and blacksmith - both have mysteriously vanished. Man-eating plants have sprouted on my paths. And strange things are afoot on Pheasant Hill…
Mathilda|Ahh, the list goes on, but the crux is one - I must solve my problems at Vermentino if I'm to stand any chance of acquiring Belgaard. Would you help me - before you help Liam? I'm willing to pay more than he's offered you.
Geralt|I can help. Least try.
Mathilda|Wonderful! You've no idea how much that means to me. My vineyard lies due west.
Mathilda|I shall stay here for a time - I must make certain Liam does not pull some stunt while my back is turned.
Geralt|Gotcha. Farewell.
Geralt|Mhh, dunno. Guess I can look around if I'm in the area. Rather not promise anything, though..
Mathilda|I cannot force your hand, of course, but I do hope you'll not refuse a damsel in distress. If you decide to help, my vineyard lies westward.
Geralt|Could look into it, but not for free.
Liam|That goes without saying. What is your rate?
Geralt|Listen, might look in on you if I'm in the area. No promises, though.
Liam|Naturally, I ask for nothing more.
Geralt|Better - a connoisseur.
Liam|Whoa-ho-ho, I see we speak the same tongue. So tell me, the swords - you merely wear them to intimidate, or do you actually use them?
Geralt|Tools of my trade. I'm a witcher.
Geralt|This vineyard, Belgaard - why's it so valuable?
Beauclair Clerk 01|Ehh, you are not from here, it certainly shows… Before Count Crespi fell prey to the Beast, Belgaard belonged to him.
Beauclair Clerk 01|As a man of wealth and influence, he guided it to immense success, brought in rare grape varieties, hired skilled workers…
Beauclair Clerk 01|I shan't trouble you with unnecessary details. Suffice to say that merging Belgaard with another vineyard is a sure recipe for success.
Geralt|Vermentino can go back to operating normally.
Liam|Wait. What about me? What about Coronata?
Beauclair Clerk 01|Ahem, if I might interject… Under the circumstances, oversight of Belgaard shall pass to Maid Matilda. Provided she still wishes to assume it, of course…
Mathilda|Of course I do! Why wouldn't I?
Beauclair Clerk 01|I shall explain everything shortly. Come with me - it's time we toured Belgaard.
Mathilda|Come with us, witcher. I rather dislike this bureaucrat's tone. I might have work for you yet…
Liam|Wait. I beg you, help me. If you don't I shall go out of business for good. You must look to Coronata, you must.
Geralt|Fine. I'll see what I can do.
Mathilda|Witcher, are you coming? We should see what's afoot at Belgaard.
Geralt|All right. Let's go.
Geralt|Join you later. Need to tend to something else, first.
Geralt|Shouldn't have any more problems with the vineyard. You can start operating normally again.
Beauclair Clerk 01|Splendid. And thus, officially, by the power vested in me, I grant you title to the Belgaard Vineyard and trust that you shall restore it to its former glory, mademoiselle.
Mathilda|I shall do everything in my power.
Mathilda|Thank you. You're truly worth your weight in gold! Ah, if my mother could see this… She always wanted a better future for me, and now, thanks to you, I might actually have one.
Mathilda|Here. Your reward as agreed.
Geralt|Thanks. And good luck.
Geralt|Solved the problems at Coronata. Vineyard can go back to operating normally.
Mathilda|Wait. What about Vermentino? You helped him, but not me?
Beauclair Clerk 01|Ahem, if I might interject… Under the circumstances, oversight of Belgaard shall pass to Master Liam. Provided he still wishes to assume it, of course…
Liam|Pish-posh! I've already drawn up a harvest schedule!
Beauclair Clerk 01|Ahem, you… you may be forced to adjust it, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. Time to visit Belgaard. Please follow me.
Liam|He's up to something and I don't like it. Come with me, witcher. There could be another contract for you in this…
Mathilda|Witcher, wait. You must help me, please. Else my vineyard will fall into ruin.
Geralt|See what I can do.
Liam|Are you coming, witcher? We ought at least to see what he wants to show us.
Geralt|Tended to Belgaard's problems. Think you can start producing wine.
Beauclair Clerk 01|Splendid. And thus, officially, by the power vested in me, I grant you title to the Belgaard Vineyard and trust that you shall prove a wise, interested, resolute steward.
Liam|Thank you!
Liam|You've saved my derriere! Ah, fortune's smiled on me since you showed up. While you were out there, I found a case with my father's notes in the cellar.
Liam|He left a whole tome's-worth, discussing which vines do best in this climate. Now that the vineyard can operate normally at last, for the first time in a long while I feel everything is falling into place. This is for you.
Geralt|Thanks. And good luck.
Geralt|Solved your problems. Coronata and Vermentino can both go back to operating normally.
Beauclair Clerk 01|What's this? Both vineyards? Why… that puts me in quite a bind.
Mathilda|Then let me release you - sell Belgaard to me.
Liam|Oh, out of the question!
Beauclair Clerk 01|Quiet! Do not dare to start that again, or I'll not sell to either of you!
Beauclair Clerk 01|In light of the situation, I would advise the parties to form a partnership.
Liam|What?!
Beauclair Clerk 01|You heard me - a partnership. That is my final decision. Now please come with me - I shall show you your new property.
Geralt|Hang on. What about my pay?
Mathilda|Just a minute. You got us into this bind, so now you must come and see it through. I've a strong sense we'll soon have more work for you. Me and my dog-diddled new partner.
Geralt|Tended to Belgaard's problems. Vineyard should be in as good a shape as ever.
Beauclair Clerk 01|Splendid. And thus, officially, by the power vested in me, I grant you title to the Belgaard Vineyard and trust that you shall make good use of its grounds and resources.
Liam|Excellent! Ah, I can already smell the grapes ripening in the sun…
Mathilda|We shan't forget what you did for us. Here, your pay.
Liam|But that's not all. You must come back and see us shortly. We've a surprise in store for you.
Geralt|I'll do that. Farewell.
Geralt|All's well at Belgaard. Took care of the problems.
Beauclair Clerk 01|Splendid. And thus, officially, by the power vested in me, I grant you title to the Belgaard Vineyard and trust that you shall make good use of its grounds and resources.
Liam|Thank you! Ah, I can already taste this vineyard's first young wines… Scrumptious.
Mathilda|Don't let the vapors go to your head…
Liam|Ehh, I fear this will not be an easy partnership… I just hope we don't end up killing one another. All the same, I thank you for your help.
Geralt|Good luck. So long.
Beauclair Clerk 01|Under the circumstances, it is my pleasure to announce that title to the Belgaard Vineyard will officially be signed over to the new consortium the two of you shall form.
Liam|Truly? I cannot believe it! We've done it!
Mathilda|Thank you, witcher! I've no idea how to repay you!
Geralt|Could start with my reward…
Liam|Yeees, well deserved, I daresay. Here.
Beauclair Clerk 01|Ahem, far be it from me to insist, but I've a feeling a professional's aid might yet be useful to you. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Come with me, it is high time you saw Belgaard.
Liam|I'm not sure I liked his tone… Come with us, witcher. Something tells me we shall have work for you yet…
Geralt|One and the same man caused Coronata's and Vermentino's problems. Got proof. A certain Count Crespi - he's at the root of it all.
Beauclair Clerk 01|What? Crespi?! Belgaard's erstwhile owner?! Why, that's impossible!
Geralt|Got it all here, in writing.
Beauclair Clerk 01|He did, indeed, have motive… He knew well his own vineyard could not survive if Vermentino and Coronata were to join forces.
Geralt|Probably why he incited the feud. Pulled it off, too, mostly. Just failed to bring his plan to completion when the Beast got him.
Mathilda|Incredible… You mean to say it… it wasn't Liam?
Liam|And I was certain my troubles were Matilda's doing…!
Beauclair Clerk 01|Ahem, in light of new evidence, the most just resolution would be for both injured parties to share oversight of Belgaard.
Liam|Wait just a minute. Do you mean to suggest we're to… cooperate?
Beauclair Clerk 01|It's the optimal solution, yes. In terms of the health of the enterprise, as well.
Mathilda|Hmm. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I do believe he's right. Perhaps it is time to bury the hatchet.
Liam|Three vineyards are more than one… There's much to be gained. So be it.
Beauclair Clerk 01|I'm glad we've come to an agreement. One question remains - what's to become of Coronata and Vermentino?
Geralt|Got caught up in the investigation. Still got problems there. But I'll clear them up.
Beauclair Clerk 01|Excellent. Then we shall await news in that matter. Preferably good news.
Geralt|That's not all. The troubles at your vineyards - solved them. You can go back to operating normally, now.
Beauclair Clerk 01|Splendid news. I'm relieved to see you hired a professional, especially one who's aid might still prove invaluable. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Follow me. It is high time you saw Belgaard.
Mathilda|Witcher, come with us, please. Something tells me we'll have tasks for you yet…
Liam|I simply cannot afford that much.
Liam|Could you not reduce it a shave?
Liam|That sounds fair.
Liam|I am in dire need, but I shall not let you pick my pockets!
Mathilda|I'm sorry. That's not an amount I can afford.
Mathilda|I sense we're close, very close…
Mathilda|Fine. Settled.
Mathilda|Would you take advantage of my misfortune?! I did not think your help would come with dirty hooks attached…
Liam|I placed the first bid!
Mathilda|But I made the best offer!
Beauclair Clerk 01|Mademoiselle, monsieur, we must remain calm…
<|endoftext|>
Beauclair Clerk 01|Master witcher! Have you any news?
Mathilda|Truly?! Wonderful! I'm but a step from taking over Belgaard! I really don't know how to thank you. Your reward.
Liam|Hah! I can't remember the last time something tickled me so! Thank you, witcher! Your pay.
Liam|A word once given… The job is done, the pay is due. Take it.
Beauclair Clerk 01|Ahem, under the circumstances, hints will have to do. And I fear they cast a decidedly unfavorable light upon Master Liam, who seems to have sought deliberately to bring harm to the Vermentino vineyard.
Beauclair Clerk 01|And in turn disqualifies him as a potential buyer. Thus, by the power vested in me as executor of this office, I do hereby sell the Belgaard vineyard to Maid Matilda.
Mathilda|Yes! Wonderful!
Liam|I cannot believe this! It defies reason! I'm innocent! Do you hear?!
Liam|You were in cahoots with her from the start, weren't you? You can forget your reward, you vile witchery… witchery… Ah, blast you!
Mathilda|How sad to see a sore loser… You must come to my new vineyard, witcher. You'll see what I've gained thanks to you. Your reward I'll pay there.
Beauclair Clerk 01|Ahem, under the circumstances, hints will have to do. And I fear they cast a decidedly unfavorable light upon Maid Matilda, who seems to have sought deliberately to bring harm to the Coronata vineyard.
Beauclair Clerk 01|And in turn disqualifies her as a potential buyer. Thus, by the power vested in me as executor of this office, I do hereby sell the Belgaard vineyard to Master Liam.
Liam|Hah! We've won, witcher! Thank you!
Mathilda|What's this? Is that it? Without proof, without a trial?
Beauclair Clerk 01|Apologies, but we've no time for that. The ducal minister strongly desires the matter be resolved quickly. Especially as there's a great deal to do yet in Belgaard… as you shall soon see. Come.
Mathilda|Devils damn you all!
Liam|I'm not sure I like that tome-jockey's tone… Come with me, witcher, you must. I shall pay you once we're there. Though something tells me you'll get another contract out of this before we're through…
Geralt|You were right - Vermentino's problems didn't come out of nowhere. Someone was behind them.
Mathilda|What do you mean, "someone"?! Liam did this!
Liam|Oooh, no, no, no! I will not listen to this slander!
Beauclair Clerk 01|Wait, wait! A third party is responsible for Vermentino's problems? Have you any proof?
Geralt|Found evidence of sabotage on Coronata lands. Someone's been causing trouble, with an aim in mind.
Liam|Mhm. I daresay I even know who.
Mathilda|What are you staring at?! I had nothing to do with this!
Beauclair Clerk 01|Wait, wait! A third party is responsible for Coronata's problems? Have you any proof?
Geralt|Coronata's and Vermentino's troubles didn't come out of nowhere. Found evidence someone was behind them.
Geralt|Specifically, someone planted archespore bulbs around the properties. That's in these letters. As for who it was…
Mathilda|What do you mean, who?! Him! And only him!
Liam|You're mad, woman! Surely you hatched this plot and now seek to stick me with the blame!
Geralt|Calm down! Both of you!
Geralt|I'll find the place the letters mention. We'll clear this up.
Geralt|Take care, now.
Mathilda|Ah, witcher. Greetings.
Geralt|Solved the troubles at your vineyard.
Mathilda|A shame it's too late… Liam's bought Belgaard. I'm left to be but a minor supplier. Such is life sometimes.
Mathilda|Still, thank you. The amount we agreed, here.
Liam|Greetings, witcher. Any news about Coronata?
Geralt|Yeah, you can go back to operating normally. Tended to all your troubles there.
Liam|I thank you. At least now I've some small chance of evading bankruptcy. Though, now that Matilda's bought Belgaard, I shall be far from the biggest player on the market…
Liam|Ah well, one ought not cry over spilt wine. I must get to work. Thank you, witcher - the pay we agreed.
Geralt|No.
Beauclair Clerk 01|Then you must find some. These are weighty accusations, they will not stand on hearsay.
Geralt|Right. I'll come by once I've got something solid.
Beauclair Clerk 01|Splendid, but do we know who was behind the vineyards' woes? Have you any proof?
Geralt|Not much, just some hints.
<|endoftext|>
Mathilda|Too much. Definitely too much.
Mathilda|A bit less? Is that out of the question?
Mathilda|Fine. We have a deal.
Geralt|More or less already agreed, I guess…
Liam|Phew, that's a weight off my chest, I must say. Your reward shall be fair, I promise.
Geralt|I'll get to work.
Geralt|I can help, sure, but I won't work for free.
Geralt|I'll look into it if I pass by. All I can promise.
Liam|It's something, thank you.
Mathilda|No, too much. Take what we offer, please, we can afford no more.
Mathilda|Decidedly too dear, that.
Mathilda|Could you shave a whisker off?
Mathilda|A fair price.
Geralt|More or less agreed already…
Mathilda|Excellent! You truly are a boon from the heavens.
Beauclair Clerk 01|Miss, come with me, please? We've formalities to attend to.
Mathilda|Of course.
Geralt|Can do it, but not for free.
Geralt|Got some other things on my plate. Need to think this through. Might look in on you if I'm in the area.
Mathilda|I will be very grateful if you do.
Mathilda|Oh, sorry, I can't possibly afford that. I hope you'll help me all the same.
Liam|That's much too much.
Liam|A bit less, could you? I'm no millionaire.
Liam|That certainly sounds reasonable. Agreed.
Geralt|Ah, in for a copper, in for a crown… Yeah, I'll help.
Liam|Thank you.
Beauclair Clerk 01|Come with me, please. We've formalities to see to.
Liam|I am right behind you.
Geralt|Need to talk about my fee, first.
Geralt|Don't know that I wanna get any more involved. One thing I can promise - if I come across anything dangerous, I'll definitely react.
Liam|Naturally, I wouldn't ask for anything more.
Liam|I've a dire need, and you seek to take advantage. Take what I offer, for truly I can afford no more.
Beauclair Clerk 01|Ahem, my desire for Belgaard to pass into capable hands was no idle whim. For the vineyard's fallen upon hard times since its previous owner's demise.
Beauclair Clerk 01|I have been told of workers dying on their rounds, monsters prowling about… Before anyone can call this home, they will have to deal with these… inconveniences. That is the minister's wish.
Geralt|More work for me, I guess…
Mathilda|If you're willing, we'll gladly accept your help.
Mathilda|It certainly seems so. But if we're to make anything of this partnership, in itself a difficult notion, we must be able to work, without hindrance or threat.
Liam|So? Will you help our fragile consortium?
Mathilda|If you're willing, I'd gladly accept your help.
Liam|Really? You'd help? Agree and I shall pay you exceedingly well.
Liam|Witcher, you're here! Any news?
Geralt|Come from a long line of vintners, don't you.
Liam|Yes, my great-grandpapa planted the first seeds at Coronata. Yet my father made the vineyard bloom.
Liam|He had hoped one of my elder brothers would take up the hoe and grape knife. Alas, he proved a tyrant. All eight fled, wanting nothing to do with winemaking.
Liam|I graduated Oxenfurt Academy and returned home to find myself up to my ears in work. I set my own plans aside, then abandoned them. But I regret nothing. I've grown to love the trade.
Geralt|Farewell.
Mathilda|Witcher! How good of you to come! Any news?
Geralt|Doing a great job here…
Mathilda|For a woman, you mean?
Geralt|For anyone. Learned long ago not to judge men and women by different standards.
Mathilda|That's nice to hear. I'd dreamt of running this vineyard since I was a child. My mother was a wash maid, found a position here. She would bring me along and while she laundered the linens I would play with the cats.
Mathilda|Lady Vermentino always fed me sweet grapes. And for a few brief moments I would imagine she was my mother, even wish it so.
Mathilda|When my real mother passed away, the Vermentinos took me in. They had no children of their own.
Mathilda|Thus I became Matilda de Vermentino. In the end I got my dream, though at times I'm still tortured by the thought that my secret wish might've brought about my birth mother's death.
Mathilda|Witcher - your pay. The amount we agreed. Now forgive me, I must get to work, look over the suppliers' bids. Liam was to do it, but he's busy, as you can see…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What's the surprise? Some new monster I need to kill?
Mathilda|No, something far more pleasant.
Liam|We've produced a wine. According to the best sommeliers, it might just dethrone Est Est.
Mathilda|We owe this success to you, so if you'd agree…
Liam|We'd like to name it after you.
Mathilda|What shall we call it?
Geralt|Call it… Geralt of Rivia.
Liam|Geralt de Rivia! Perfect!
Mathilda|If you wouldn't mind, we'd like to send a few bottles to your home every so often.
Geralt|I'd be honored, thanks.
Mathilda|No, we thank you. Take care, witcher.
Geralt|Maybe… Butcher of Blaviken?
Liam|A strong name. I like it!
Geralt|Why not… White Wolf.
Liam|Wild, with character! It fits perfectly!
Geralt|Hm. You two seem to be getting along.
Mathilda|We are. There came a point we realized we had no grounds to quarrel. Things became altogether… pleasant.
Liam|And a bit spicy.
Mathilda|Romantic. Quite.
Geralt|Got it. Needn't say more. Glad things're going well for you.
Liam|Oh, witcher, greetings! Kind of you to come. Matilda and I, we've a surprise for you.
Mathilda|Witcher! A word! We've got something for you! It will only take a moment, I promise.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Place mentioned in the note. Archespore saplings are somewhere around here.
Beauclair Clerk 01|Please don't bother me. I'm busy.
Geralt|Hm, a letter and a key. In a place like this? Oughta be interesting.
Geralt|Interesting… This note plus what I found earlier - some third party's causing problems at the vineyards.
Geralt|Need to find the spot the letter mentions. Bet I'll find something mighty interesting behind whatever door this key opens.
Geralt|Hm. What've we got here? No chance this letter wound up here by accident.
Geralt|Note's clear - someone's out to sabotage Coronata. Shame I don't know who… though I could still find out if I keep looking.
Mathilda|You will help me, won't you?
Geralt|Letter proves Count Crespi's behind the sabotage at both vineyards. Gotta tell Matilda and Liam.
Liam|I'm counting on you, witcher.
Beauclair Clerk 01|Come now, madame, monsieur. We shall never get anywhere in this manner…
Liam|I care about one thing only - acquiring Belgaard. I will make an infinitely better steward than she will. A pretty face is hardly enough if the head it adorns is empty.
Mathilda|Says the most foppish philanderer of the southern reaches! You'd do better to tend to your vineyard and look less to the grape-stomping lasses.
Liam|Until you solve all Coronata's problems, I am deep in the cesspool.
Mathilda|Clear my vineyard, please. It's very important.
Mathilda|I thank you again. And hope the wine's to your liking.
Liam|We shall never forget what you did for us. Our grandchildren will drink your health!
Beauclair Clerk 01|Please, sir. Do not disturb.
Geralt|Apparently someone's sabotaging operations at Vermentino. But the letter doesn't say who. Hm. Need to keep looking. Could still find out.
Geralt|Letter suggests a third party's behind the troubles at Liam's and Matilda's vineyards. Still don't know who, though. And I'm no longer likely to find out. Dammit.
Geralt|Ducal clerk's looking for help. Could be good coin to be made.
Mathilda|The steward told me you dispatched those belly-aching suppliers handily… Good work.
Liam|Thank you. I never thought I'd hear praise from your lips… Usually you find fault in everything I do.
Mathilda|I don't find fault, I am merely honest. As I am now - you did well.
Geralt|Hmm… Looks like an archespore killed him. Should search the body.
Geralt|Archespore saplings? Takes a degenerate to cultivate something like this.
Geralt|Need to incinerate them. Before they spew spores and spread.
Geralt|Problems Liam de Coronata mentioned - must've been talking about this…
Geralt|Matilda Vermentino must've meant this when she mentioned troubles…
Geralt|Well, well. Seems the saboteur came around here, too.
Geralt|Hmm… Looks like an archespore killed him.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|So you're Gretka…
Verden Girl 02|I am. And you're Geralt.
Geralt|How'd you know?
Verden Girl 02|Because you've white hair and a medallion shaped like a wolf. Ciri told me about you.
Geralt|You and Ciri talked a bit, didn't you?
Verden Girl 02|We did.
Geralt|Did she say where she was going? Or what she came here to look for?
Verden Girl 02|She said she was looking for you and a sorceress. But you're here, so I guess she didn't find you.
Verden Girl 02|I wonder if she helped that friend of hers…
Geralt|Ciri wanted to help a friend? Any idea who it was?
Verden Girl 02|What do you mean who? Her friend. She said he was in trouble and that she had to save him.
Geralt|Look familiar?
Verden Girl 02|My top! Where'd you find it?
Geralt|Ciri's room.
Verden Girl 02|We'd play in her room sometimes. I was sad one day, and Ciri carved it for me. Such a shame she had to leave.
Geralt|Do you know where Ciri is?
Verden Girl 02|No. One day I brought her breakfast, and she was already gone. The baron told me she'd left.
Geralt|Didn't ask where she'd gone?
Verden Girl 02|I did, but he said I was too little and I wouldn't understand.
Verden Girl 02|But Ciri left me a gift.
Geralt|A gift?
Verden Girl 02|Yes, this. A green stone.
Geralt|Beautiful as gifts go. Hide it well, don't show it to anyone. It's worth a lot.
Geralt|Thanks, Gretka. Have fun.
Verden Girl 02|But I'm not playin'. I'm helpin'.
Verden Girl 02|Geralt!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|How're you feeling?
Margarita Laux Antille|Better, I thank you. If you'd not arrived in time, things might have ended considerably worse. I am your debtor.
Geralt|Thank Yennefer. It was her idea, her plan.
Geralt|Thought Margarita Laux-Antille'd be among the last to get nabbed by witch hunters.
Margarita Laux Antille|Were it dependent solely on me, of course I would have. But you forget I had my students to consider.
Margarita Laux Antille|I knew the hunters would eventually reach Aretuza - it was but a matter of time. So when I heard Triss was organizing escapes to Kovir, I saw no reason to hesitate.
Margarita Laux Antille|I gathered my novices and we rode here to Novigrad. Sadly, we were caught and thrown in Deireadh before I could contact Triss.
Geralt|Didn't see any other sorceresses in there with you…
Margarita Laux Antille|Because they'd already been executed. Burned… alive… one after the other. The most talented girls in the North. Radovid was saving me for last.
Geralt|If you're here, what's become of Aretuza?
Margarita Laux Antille|The day I arrived in Novigrad, I received a message from Biruta Icarti. A short, curt note - "School overrun by Redanians. The libraries burn. Handful of pupils fled with Nina Vivero, the rest are dead. It is over."
Margarita Laux Antille|Later I learned priests of the Eternal Fire stood amidst the academy's ruins, promising the rabble that such a punishment awaited all mages and traitors.
Geralt|No reaction from the Council, the Conclave?
Margarita Laux Antille|Do you jest? They asked Radovid to "intervene." Just after he'd appointed them.
Geralt|Farewell, Rita.
Margarita Laux Antille|Geralt. What can I do for you?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|It's wounded… won't attack. Gotta knock it off that ledge somehow.
Geralt|Muzzle's caked in blood. Didn't give up without a fight.
Geralt|Tracks're irregular here. Monster must've started staggering. Was wounded, most likely.
Geralt|Blood stains. And scales.
Geralt|Blood… Monster blood.
Geralt|Feathers? Narrows down the list of suspects.
Geralt|Tracks lead to the cave.
Geralt|A cockatrice…
Geralt|Sound's coming from above…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Here about the cockatrice you folk called a shrieker. Won't be a problem anymore.
Verden Old Man 03|What did you call it? A cockatrice?
Geralt|Yes. Some also call it a skoffin.
Verden Old Man 03|Well, whatever ye or they call it, you've earned your reward. Here, all yours.
Geralt|Heard you have a problem - a monster you call a shrieker?
Verden Old Man 03|Aye, prowls about, it does. Snatches cows and goats, mostly, but it won't scorn a man if it runs into one. Borzoy, huntsman under the old lord, well, he said enough's enough, claimed he'd put a stop to it, drive the beast away.
Geralt|Mhm.
Verden Old Man 03|Took a hatchet, laid in ambush for the shrieker beyond the moat, where the fields start. It's where we found 'im, guts stretched o'er the crown of a tree like gossamer. Took half a day to collect the parts, put 'em in a grave.
Geralt|High time a professional took a look at this shrieker. Anyone around here know more about the beast?
Verden Old Man 03|Borzoy's son Symko does. Saw the horror with his own eyes. But… ye might find the lad hard to chat with. Still mourns his father, methinks.
Geralt|I see… Where'll I find him?
Verden Old Man 03|At me homestead. I took the tyke in when he lost his dad. The mother passed long ago.
Geralt|I know times are tough but… I'll need you to cough up a bit more coin.
Geralt|Sorry. Don't have time to help you just now.
Geralt|Let's talk about this contract…
Geralt|Shrieker won't trouble you anymore.
Verden Old Man 03|Thank ye, master witcher. Your reward… 'Tain't much but as they say, "take care of the pennies…"
Geralt|Keep the coin. You took in an orphan, need it more than I do.
Verden Old Man 03|And they call witchers unfeelin', inhuman… Well, I thank ye - from the bottom of me heart.
Geralt|Thank you… Any problems in the future, you keep me in mind.
Geralt|Farewell.
Geralt|Greetings.
Verden Old Man 03|Yeah?
Verden Old Man 03|What's that? Master! I've not seen that much coin in my life!
Verden Old Man 03|Ye seek a lot… A few crowns too dear.
Verden Old Man 03|I suppose I can add that. Ye are riskin' your neck for us.
Verden Old Man 03|Oh, you're as irritatin' as a gadfly 'fore a storm. Willin' to pay that much there and not a crown more.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Can we talk?
Verden Boy 01|Lemme be.
Geralt|Calm down. I just wanna…
Verden Boy 01|Go, I said!
Geralt|I wanna avenge your father. But to do that, I gotta know what killed him.
Verden Boy 01|Shrieker killed him! Don't you know?!
Geralt|That name doesn't mean much to me. Describe the beast, tell me what it looked like.
Verden Boy 01|Somethin' like a rooster… but huge… with a lizard's tail.
Verden Boy 01|I-I-I heard Ruffler barkin' in the woods. Ran to see what he were on about. There were dad… in the bushes, a hole through his belly! And he were… moanin'! Screamin'! I wanted to help! But how could I?! How?!
Geralt|Nothing you could do for him, kid. Beast has to die, that's all… Leave it to me.
Geralt|Shush, now. Calm…
Verden Boy 01|Caaa-aalm. Calm.
Verden Boy 01|Lemme alone.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Ugh… Smells worse than it looks.
Geralt|Blood looks fresh, but where're the bodies? Hm…
Geralt|Takes strength to do something like this.
Geralt|Insect excretions…
Geralt|Monster tracks.
Geralt|Blood, flesh, digestive juices… Food for its young.
Geralt|Eggs'll hatch soon. Gotta destroy them.
Geralt|A shoe… bearing Master Clogs' mark. All that's left of the body.
Geralt|Something just woke up.
Geralt|Young specimen. Mother can't be far.
Geralt|Arachas… a venomous one.
Geralt|Calfskin ankle boot… All that's left of Mikkel.
Geralt|Putting yourself to the sword? All the better.
Geralt|Need a trophy for Mikkel's brother. Proof of what happened.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|I have bad news. An arachas killed your brother. If it's any comfort, I avenged him.
Verden Peasant 05|Comfort, hah, 'course it's no comfort… And I told Mikkel, "Why ye so eager to help strangers, sit your arse down or there'll be misfortune!"
Verden Peasant 05|Well? Why you still standin' there? Can't get your fill of others' misfortune?
Geralt|No. I prefer porridge and gravy, like everybody else. Pay me and I'll go buy some.
Verden Peasant 05|I'd 'ave paid ye if you'd brought Mikkel back alive.
Geralt|Risked my life. Think I deserve something for that.
Verden Peasant 05|Here… now piss off.
Geralt|I'm due a reward. Give me some coin.
Verden Peasant 05|A reward, aye… Your due… Here.
Geralt|Your brother was a better man… So long.
Geralt|Understand you have a contract for me?
Verden Peasant 05|Aye. It's me brother, Mikkel. Been a week now since he took the women of Bellows into the hills.
Geralt|The women of Bellows?
Verden Peasant 05|Bellows were a rich village… till the war passed through. Huts were burned down, larders cleared out, all the men folk conscripted. Women were left to fend for themselves, without food nor shelter.
Verden Peasant 05|No one wanted 'em. Redanians wouldn't let 'em into Novigrad, so Mikkel took them to the old mines, get 'em out of the rain, at least. And I've not had word from him since.
Geralt|All right, I'll look for your brother. How will I recognize him?
Verden Peasant 05|Shouldn't be hard. He were the only lad in a group o' women.
Geralt|Corpses aren't always in a condition where I can determine the sex.
Verden Peasant 05|Corpses?! Take it back! They got lost, is all. But if worst comes to worst… well, he had calfskin ankle boots, work of Master Clogs. Told him not to wear 'em into the hills, he'd only ruin them. But he was so proud of 'em…
Geralt|Think I know enough… Thanks.
Geralt|Could look into it… if you paid me more.
Geralt|Sorry, can't take this on right now.
Verden Peasant 05|A witcher? And not a second too soon!
Geralt|Given your offer some thought…
Geralt|So long.
Verden Peasant 05|Greetin's.
Verden Peasant 05|What?! Ye fall on your head today?!
Verden Peasant 05|Just a smidgen too high, that…
Verden Peasant 05|All right… Me brother's life's at stake, so I can't skimp. It's a deal!
Verden Peasant 05|Here we is, chatterin' on and on, while Mikkel might be coming to harm. Take the offer, or I'll find me another to do the job.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Greetings.
Verden Old Man 02|What do ye want?
Geralt|So the notice about Jenny o' the Woods… you posted it, right?
Verden Old Man 02|Ooh aye, 'twas me. You'd do it? You's a witcher, is you not? Straight off a picture in me granny's book.
Verden Old Man 02|"Monstrum, or a Portrayal of Witchers" - remember like it were today. We be afeared of her, but Jenny o' the Woods - what's she to you?
Geralt|I'm on it. Know if anyone's seen Jenny o' the Woods, could tell me more about her?
Verden Old Man 02|Ol' Willem must've. But he won't tell you naught. He were weak of heart. We found him in the fields this mornin'.
Verden Old Man 02|Other folk are afeared to go out nights. But you might try Agneta - lives at the end of the village. Word is she saw the wraith.
Geralt|And nothing happened to her? She wasn't hurt?
Verden Old Man 02|Agneta? Outlived three husbands, that one. Jenny o' the Woods won't do naught to that wench.
Geralt|Let's talk rewards.
Verden Old Man 02|Hm, aye… So, how much would ye wish?
Geralt|Sorry, don't have the time for this.
Geralt|Zula and Bokhai - did you know them? They must've lived in this village.
Verden Old Man 02|Good gods, ye knows? 'Tis witchery. They disappeared - both of them - into thin air. We've not seen 'em a week, now.
Geralt|I found the girl's grave and a letter. It's clear she rejected Bokhai because she loved another…
Verden Old Man 02|Zula and Ontan, aye. We thought they'd fled north to seek happiness there. Bokhai departed round the same time.
Verden Old Man 02|So, that's to mean our Zula's the wraith. Can't be. Such a good lass, and so pretty.
Geralt|Any idea where they used to meet?
Verden Old Man 02|Hm, well, can't say for sure. But the young 'uns, they go to the clearin', mostly, west of the village, past the fields. Zula… Good gods…
Geralt|About that contract…
Verden Old Man 02|Changed your mind, have ye?
Geralt|Jenny o' the Woods is gone. Got rid of her.
Verden Old Man 02|Phew… She'll not be back?
Geralt|No. I know how to dispatch nightwraiths for good.
Verden Old Man 02|Aye, of course. Your reward, as agreed. Many thanks to ye, master witcher.
Geralt|Farewell.
Verden Old Man 02|Oh no, ye don't. That's far too dear.
Verden Old Man 02|Well, sounds right for Jenny o'the Woods, but we're just short. Will ye drop it a bit?
Verden Old Man 02|Oh, have it your way!
Verden Old Man 02|Is that what ye want? To benefit off 'uman misery? Ye'll take what's offered, or I'll find me another witchman!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|A piece of fabric… possibly from a dress. Got snagged on the undergrowth.
Geralt|Prints… Too small to be a man's, too large for a child.
Geralt|Stride indicates she was running… probably why she tore her dress.
Geralt|Somebody chase her?
Geralt|Avoids confrontation… Gotta learn more about her, no hope of defeating her otherwise.
Geralt|Couldn't outrun her pursuer. He stabbed her or slit her throat. Strange - left the knife behind.
Geralt|Dried blood on it. Could come in handy.
Geralt|Dragged the body through here. Clear trail…
Geralt|Lugged the body all the way to the woods, buried it here. Shallow grave - murderer must've been pressed for time.
Geralt|Something's sticking out… A letter?
Geralt|No way I can hope to lift this curse.
Geralt|Gotta drive the wraith away. Stand a chance if I can bind it to one spot for a while.
Geralt|A nightwraith won't appear in daylight.
Geralt|A scorned lover killed the woman, seems to me.
Geralt|Still need some mistletoe…
Geralt|They gotta know about the wraith in the village. I'll have to ask…
Geralt|Ealdorman probably knew the girl. I oughta ask him.
Geralt|A nightwraith…
<|endoftext|>
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|The missing patrol - have you any news?
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|What brings you here?
Geralt|Saw your notice. Can anyone tell me about the monster?
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|I can. A patrol has been lost, somewhere along the south shore of Lake Wyndamer. We must know why.
Geralt|What makes this witchers' work?
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|Some brick makers live south of here - they call their village Byways. Almost empty now, many have run away. They speak of a monster which kills.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|Redanians do not patrol there, that would be foolish. And robbers do not attack imperials - that would be even more foolish. This leaves one option - a monster.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|You must learn what happened to this patrol. The empire places great value on the lives of its soldiers. Do this, learn well what happened. The reward will be proper.
Geralt|Deal. I'll see what happened to your patrol, whether there really is a monster in Byways.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|Good, good.
Geralt|Need more coin. Offer's not nearly enough.
Geralt|Not sure it's a monster, and I don't take sides in the war.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|Ah, the famed witcher neutrality. Should you change your mind or learn anything about the missing men - you know where to find me.
Geralt|Just so happens I've been to Byways. Your patrol went there, too.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|Yes, what of them?
Geralt|They're dead. Lots of ghouls there, now, drawn by the stench of corpses. Wouldn't advise going there.
Geralt|Been to Byways. A vampire was terrorizing the village.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|This is why they did not return.
Geralt|Ekimmarae are tough, even for a group of soldiers.
Geralt|Here about the missing patrol.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|You have changed your mind? Or have you tidings?
Geralt|Farewell.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|We will bury them with honors, as heroes. Your reward - well deserved.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|You are mad, monster slayer. The imperial army is not the society for the protection and well-being of mutants.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|This is close to reasonable. We might yet agree.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|This much we can pay.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|You know what I will tell you? You will take this job at the rate offered or try your luck somewhere else. That is my last word.
<|endoftext|>
Verden Old Man 03|Ah, a witcher.
Geralt|What happened?
Verden Peasant 01|Nilfgaardians came plunderin'… Lookin' for valuables - as if we was rich.
Geralt|Who killed them? Couldn't 'ave been you.
Verden Old Man 03|I dunno. Must've been those beasts you slaughtered.
Geralt|This'd be the first time ghouls came to help out a village in trouble. At this rate, they'll be taking jobs off the notice boards before long.
Verden Peasant 01|It was how it was. Why dwell on it?
Geralt|Someone's paid me to dwell.
Verden Old Man 03|And who might that be?
Geralt|That's for me to know. Gonna look around . Best stay out of my way.
Geralt|You're hiding something. Gonna find out what it is.
Verden Peasant 01|There's naught here. Black Ones didn't even find anythin'.
Geralt|Outta my way.
Geralt|Your choice. Not about to stay where I'm not wanted.
Verden Old Man 03|Always good to hear wise words. Farewell.
Geralt|Something stinks. And I don't mean the corpses.
<|endoftext|>
Verden Old Man 03|There's nothin' there.
Geralt|Tracks lead to this house. What happened here?
Verden Old Man 03|What do you mean, what happened?
Geralt|You're all still in danger. And only I can help. I'm the only one who can rid you of this threat.
Verden Old Man 03|What do I know?
Geralt|Listen, you. If you don't tell me everything you know, you could all die, understand? Is that a burden you can live with?
Verden Old Man 03|There's tunnels beneath the village…
Geralt|Tunnels?
Verden Old Man 03|Elven ruins. We scavenge 'em for trinkets, small treasures, sell them to Novigrad merchants. No one expected anythin' bad to come of it.
Verden Old Man 03|We dug through some rubble, found a chamber. A beast slept inside. We felled the props so the ceiling'd collapse. Didn't bury the monster, though…
Geralt|Gimme the key to the door.
Verden Old Man 03|You'd go in?
Geralt|No, wanna pour wax through its head, tell you your fortune. Now gimme the key.
Geralt|So, correct me if I'm wrong.
Geralt|You dug through to the monster's lair. Then buried the entrance, but the Nilfgaardians opened it again to look for treasure.
Geralt|Beast killed the Black Ones and returned to it's lair. You wanted to bury the corpses, but their stench lured ghouls to the village. Now I'm here. Sound about right?
Verden Old Man 03|Tis as you say, yes.
Geralt|I'm going down there. If I'm gone long - run. Barring the door, nailing it shut - resolves nothing. There're other ways out of the tunnels, gotta be.
Geralt|What'd the monster look like?
Verden Old Man 03|Twere dark down below, couldn't see.
Geralt|So how'd it kill the Nilfgaardians?
Verden Old Man 03|I ran, couldn't watch it happen.
Geralt|Last chance - what happened to the Nilfgaardians? What's behind that door?
<|endoftext|>
Verden Old Man 03|Gods! He lives!
Geralt|Found an ekimmara hibernating underground. It was old - must've been asleep for centuries.
Verden Old Man 03|An ekimmara?
Geralt|Vampire. Won't trouble you again.
Verden Old Man 03|You cut off its head, drive a stake through its heart?
Geralt|Did what I had to. Don't go down into those tunnels anymore. Ekimmarae aren't known to be loners.
Verden Old Man 03|We didn't hire you… Still, seems you deserve a--
Geralt|You bet I do. Pay up.
Verden Old Man 03|You've done well… but others hired you, said so yourself. Theys oughta pay you.
Geralt|Farewell.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Ghouls… And where there's ghouls… there's usually corpses…
Geralt|Anyone there?! You can come out! It's safe now!
Geralt|Thrown to the ground with great force… Internal hemorrhaging.
Geralt|Jaws strong enough to crush armor.
Geralt|Armor pierced, arteries torn open.
Geralt|Scent of blood's still strong. Oughta follow it.
Geralt|Hmm, planks can be lifted.
Geralt|Human blood.
Geralt|Fur shreds.
Geralt|An ekimmara. Hibernated here… till the villagers woke it.
Geralt|Ghouls tore the dog to bits. Soldiers died some other way.
Geralt|Handiwork of ghouls.
Geralt|Scent of blood leads to the hut.
<|endoftext|>
Verden Peasant 02|You goin' north, master?
Geralt|Why do you ask?
Verden Peasant 02|Thought you could see if anythin's happened to our men. They've been gone a while.
Geralt|What do you need?
Verden Peasant 02|Merchant caravan came through not long past. Hired some of our boys to guide 'em to the bridge. They were due back yesterday…
Geralt|Fine. Keep my eyes open.
Verden Peasant 02|Me brother Thomil lead 'em. Talk to him when you find them. Clever man, not like the rest of 'em, eh?
Geralt|I found your friends.
Verden Peasant 02|Aye, I've spoken to 'em. Eh, too damn bad Thomil didn't make it…
Verden Peasant 02|Here, take this.
Geralt|Thanks.
Geralt|Farewell.
Geralt|My reward - how do you wanna figure it?
Verden Peasant 02|Oh, ah, we thought-- But aye, ye… you're owed for your trouble.
Verden Peasant 02|Greetin's.
Verden Peasant 02|Master, ye witcher Geralt of Rivia?
Geralt|Depends.
Verden Peasant 02|Some of our folk claim a witcher, a great hero, dragged 'em from a wyvern's maw. We've a reward…
Geralt|Then I'm definitely Geralt of Rivia.
Verden Peasant 02|Why so dear?! Ye think we've a dwarven vault nestled in the underbrush? That's too much, definitely.
Verden Peasant 02|Dunno, dunno… Could ye drop it a bit more?
Verden Peasant 02|If that suits ye, excellent.
Verden Peasant 02|Would ye strip a man of his breeches o'er his head? For a small favor?! Take what's offered, or I'll find another.
Verden Peasant 02|Master witcher, a word, if ye will. Might have a job for ye. Couple of our folk have gone missin' and--
Geralt|Think I ran into them, cave north of here? A wyvern attacked them, one lost his life, but the others should be here soon.
Verden Peasant 02|Dammit all, we never should've split, let 'em go off on their own. The wyvern… did ye cut it down? All the one of ye?
Geralt|Your friends weren't exactly eager to help. Didn't find the decency to offer a reward, either.
Verden Peasant 02|How am I to know ye speak the truth?
Geralt|Suppose we can wait till they get back. Though I should charge you more, if so.
Verden Peasant 02|Naye, no need. Gods'll judge ye if you've not spoke the truth.
<|endoftext|>
Verden Peasant 03|By Kreve! Your eyes, they shine so in the dark, thought at first it were the lizard comin'!
Geralt|Thing that attacked - how big was it?
Verden Peasant 05|Well, too big to squeeze in here! It were huge. And those teeth, ugh! We barely escaped.
Verden Peasant 03|Wonder if it killed the traders… Whoresons sure had it comin'.
Verden Peasant 05|Important thing now's to get outta here. Will ye help, master witcher?
Geralt|Need to tend to the monster. Doubt I'll have to look far. Wyverns like to herd their prey towards their nests.
Verden Peasant 05|We'll wait here. Wouldn't want to get in your way.
Verden Peasant 05|We'll wait here. Wouldn't want to get in your way.
Geralt|Danger's passed. Beast must be long gone.
Verden Peasant 05|And I expect he's waitin' out there. Ready to spring soon as we come out.
Geralt|Didn't attack me.
Verden Peasant 05|Probably seen you're a witcher. Clever one, that lizard.
Verden Peasant 03|If you're not willin' to help - go. We'll wait here.
Geralt|Which one of you's Thomil?
Verden Peasant 05|That one over there - beast got him. But… how do you know?
Geralt|His brother asked me to come and find you.
Geralt|Tell me what happened.
Verden Peasant 05|Some traders hired us. To protect 'em along the high road, they said. 'Fore we knew it, they'd bound us like calves.
Geralt|Why?
Verden Peasant 05|They were kind enough to explain - and real precise - that we were necessary sacrifice for progress and trade.
Verden Peasant 03|So they left us - tied to the wagon as beast bait. Weren't long 'fore a huge lizard appeared, as if its master had whistled.
Geralt|Monsters must've learned by now that army supplies travel down this road.
Verden Peasant 03|Aye, clever one, the lizard. Cut us off straight away, left us to crawl in here. Poor Thomil didn't make it.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Someone was running - fast, panicked. Prints're deep… end suddenly.
Geralt|Claw marks…
Geralt|Caught one just before he reached the cave.
Geralt|More will spawn. Need to destroy the nests.
Geralt|Royal wyvern. Lucky me.
Geralt|Wonder what happened.
Geralt|Wasn't them that attacked those people. Gotta be a royal wyvern hiding around here somewhere.
Geralt|Someone walked through the spilled wine.
Geralt|A flyer, swooped down… Judging by the claw marks, gotta be a wyvern or a forktail.
Geralt|Shattered the wine barrel, but seems the people managed to escape.
Geralt|Kaedweni. Smell'll linger for hours…
Geralt|Tracks lead to the cave.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Grave's been dug up… recently. Smell of cadaverine's old, though. Overripe. Wonder where the stench'll lead me…
Geralt|Ghouls could've dug up the corpse… definitely couldn't 'uve snatched the kid from the village, though.
Geralt|Still might be worth looking at those graves…
Geralt|Hm, whatever filth lives here sure chose a unusual place for its lair.
Geralt|Creature can use tools… means it's sapient. Or just plain clever.
Geralt|Somebody's doing some cooking. This… it's a human femur… a child's.
Geralt|Gotta be a grave hag.
Geralt|Collected the skulls to draw the Power through them. Confidence grew enough it started prowling the village.
Geralt|Human skulls in a magic circle. Monster's clearly using them, drawing strength from the Place of Power.
Geralt|Need to take the skulls, force it to go back to the cemetery. I'll get it there.
Geralt|That oughta really piss it off. Now to lay low in the cemetery. It's likely to crawl out there after dark.
Geralt|Dug up - no tools used, though.
Geralt|Dug up with a hoe? Nope - claw marks right there.
Geralt|Ghouls dug up the graves, then the stench of decay attracted wild dogs.
Geralt|But neither ghouls nor dogs steal kids.
<|endoftext|>
Verden Peasant 03|Hm?
Geralt|Here about the job.
Geralt|Seems you got a problem. Some graves get dug up?
Verden Peasant 03|If that were only it… Every now and then a vile beast'd come 'round the graveyard, devour what's fresh, then move on…
Verden Peasant 03|Started again not long past. Thought to meself, just don't step out after dark and lock your door tight. But then a young 'un went missin'…
Geralt|From the graveyard?
Verden Peasant 03|Nay, from the village. Little snotter wouldn'ta come here of his own. And I'd heard somethin' like a whimper the night…
Geralt|Didn't bother to come out, see what was happening?
Verden Peasant 03|Think me daft? If you've monsters, ye need a witcher.
Geralt|See if I can learn what's out there.
Geralt|Let's talk about my reward.
Geralt|Sorry, gotta pass on this job for now.
Verden Peasant 03|Figured ye could use that copper after all, eh?
Verden Peasant 03|And?
Geralt|It's taken care of. It was a grave hag that dug up the graves and snatched the child.
Verden Peasant 03|Aye, so… how is the little tyke?
Geralt|Child's dead.
Verden Peasant 03|Oh, 'tis as I thought.
Geralt|What about my reward?
Verden Peasant 03|Oh, I've not forgotten, nay. Here ye go, thanks much for your help.
Geralt|Found him in the grave hag's lair. In her cauldron, to be precise… want me to go on?
Verden Peasant 03|Might've not even said that much…
Verden Peasant 03|Will ye hunt the monster? Though I cannot say what nature o' beast it is.
Verden Peasant 03|Somethin' prowls the graveyard nights. Young 'uns from the village 'ave gone missin'. But what's done it - I've nary a clue.
Geralt|It was a grave hag. Made its lair nearby.
Verden Peasant 03|Was? Mean to say it's dead already? Made quick work o' that, you did.
Geralt|Take care.
Verden Peasant 03|Screech, creak, fiddle string! Me ghostly laddie, dance!
Verden Peasant 03|For all of stolen coppers three,
Verden Peasant 03|a great feast tonight will be.
Verden Peasant 03|Ravens, worms and creepin' rats
Verden Peasant 03|will have a mighty treat of thee.
Verden Peasant 03|Greetings! Since ye killed the hag, been so silent in the graveyard ye can hear the maggots workin'!
Verden Peasant 03|Hoo, well, that's expectin' a lot. Much too much, so to speak.
Verden Peasant 03|Just the tiniest bit dear, but we'll settle soon, I can see that. Hagglin's as much an art as… err, lots of other arts!
Verden Peasant 03|Rate's fair, considerin' the job. I know a bit about these things.
Verden Peasant 03|What?! That much?! Must be drunk on fool's parsley tea! I better figure the price.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Monster wiped out the whole pack.
Geralt|Big, really big…
Geralt|Left a lot of fur when it rubbed against the trunk. Scent's still there.
Geralt|Gotta find another way.
Geralt|Died recently. Wonder what killed it.
Geralt|Paw prints… Fight lasted a while.
Geralt|Second set of tracks. It's either a huge fiend or…
Geralt|Tufts of blood-caked fur… Second beast was a different color.
Geralt|A chort - it's gotta be. Probably competed for territory with the fiend.
Geralt|Hmm, have to lure him here somehow.
Geralt|Too bad the dung's not fresh… but it oughta still work for a lure.
Geralt|Done. Oughta attract the chort's attention.
Geralt|It'll smell this five miles away.
Geralt|Beast's sure to show. Just gotta wait in the cave.
Geralt|Both lost loads of blood.
<|endoftext|>
Verden Peasant 01|Ooh, aye?
Geralt|Fine. I'll take care of it.
Verden Peasant 01|Fortune smiled upon us when it brought you here. Good huntin' to ye!
Geralt|Could tend to the beast for you… but not for free.
Verden Peasant 01|How much d'ye need?
Geralt|Take care now.
Geralt|Here about the contract. Any idea what this monster is?
Verden Peasant 01|Nay, but proper huge it must be. Slaughtered no less than a dozen wolves. Ripped their guts out, but left lots uneaten.
Verden Peasant 01|Means malice rules it, makes it kill. Howls and bellows nights somethin' fierce. Folk're afeard to venture into the woods, though hunger grips the village.
Geralt|A chort was prowling the nearby forest. Found itself competing for territory with a fiend, so it turned aggressive.
Verden Peasant 01|A chort, a fiend - why they be botherin' us? Think more'll come? Think they've done made a pact to take our village?
Geralt|Doubt it. But I'll be sure to keep my eyes open, see if there's anything else out there.
Verden Peasant 01|Cheers then, witcher! Here, take the purse. All the folk of the village chipped in.
Geralt|Thanks. Take care now.
Verden Peasant 01|Huh? Where're we to get a sum like that? Ye been here long? Don't seem it. Have ye seen how folk live?
Verden Peasant 01|It's a lot… But truth be told, job like that… Drop your ask a couple o' crowns and we'll be set.
Verden Peasant 01|That's a sum we can agree to.
Verden Peasant 01|Wha, ye barmy? Whuh. I do beg your pardon, but… well, that's not decent! Tell ye how much we've collected. Ye can take it or be on your way.
<|endoftext|>
Verden Old Man 01|Careful, sir, a monster prowls the bog. Enter the mist and ye'll never see home again!
Geralt|I can help… For a fee.
Verden Old Man 01|Course! Why, even an ox don't pull a plow for free.
Geralt|All right, time I got to work. Where'll I find this monster?
Verden Old Man 01|Start south of here. But beware, bad, poxy air hangs o'er the marsh. Stings your eyes, claws at your throat… claws so hard ye could choke!
Geralt|Afraid I'll need more than an ox needs. How much're you willing to pay, exactly?
Geralt|Take care of yourself.
Geralt|Assume you put up the notice in Downwarren.
Verden Old Man 01|Aye, 'twere me. Good to know someone reads 'em. Paid a scribe a dozen eggs to write it up.
Geralt|Monster's dead. Fog's dispersed.
Verden Old Man 01|Hah! Village folk'll be content! Given 'em cause to celebrate! Well, ye've earned your reward. Take it - and fare ye well!
Geralt|Hang on a minute. This is less than we agreed.
Verden Old Man 01|Master witcher… That beast, it kept me from gatherin' peat. And I'd still me family to feed. But a few crowns left now and I've yet to buy new tools.
Verden Old Man 01|Show some mercy… I'll pay ye, I will. Pay ye twice the fee! But in a week's time, once I've made up some of me losses.
Geralt|This shit never changes - I risk my life for you folk while you try to swindle me outta coin. You'll give me all you've got, old-timer. Now.
Verden Old Man 01|H-here.
Geralt|Good. Now get lost.
Geralt|Fine, so be it. But you remember that I'll remember… You won't get out of paying this.
Verden Old Man 01|Thank ye, witcher, thank ye kindly, m'lord. Melitele bless ye, may ye be fruitful and--
Geralt|Get to work. You've only got a week.
Geralt|This monster - tell me more.
Verden Old Man 01|Only seen it once meself - and that from afar and past dusk. Thought it were a man at first. Then it turned, and I saw eyes burnin' like coals and a jaw full o' fangs, one next to the other.
Geralt|Humanoid, nocturnal. Hmm. First attack - remember when it happened?
Verden Old Man 01|A week past, nearabout. It was then Borin vanished. Merek and Tomil went lookin' for him, didn't come back either, them two. I were afeared.
Verden Old Man 01|Now none dare venture into the bog. Camp stands deserted, and the peat there… master, it's the best sort! Black as pitch and oily - good for fuel and--
Geralt|Fascinating. But staying with the topic at hand…
Verden Old Man 01|Any tidin's?
Verden Old Man 01|Witcher… Greetin's.
Geralt|I want my coin. Where is it?
Verden Old Man 01|Ye've come too early… We said a week!
Geralt|Just making sure you remember.
Geralt|See you soon.
Verden Old Man 01|There, take it. Twice the sum, as agreed. I keep my word!
Geralt|Sure, second time around… Never mind. Thank you - and farewell.
Verden Old Man 01|I mine peat, not gold, master. Could never pay that much in me life!
Verden Old Man 01|That I simply do not have! Would a few crowns less satisfy ye?
Verden Old Man 01|Oh, master, you value your services dear… But so be it, I'll agree to that.
Verden Old Man 01|Seems you'd make a fool of me given the chance. I'm done hagglin'. Here's my final word.
<|endoftext|>
Troll_1|Man? Wham-a-wham go man! So wham go troll, too!
Geralt|Wait. I wanna talk.
Troll_1|Talk…? Talk. But you calm. Or troll you wham-a-wham, like thems.
Geralt|Exactly. Why'd you… wham 'em?
Troll_1|Thems in-walk troll house. Troll say, "Out mans!" But they wham-a-wham troll rocks. So troll wham, too!
Geralt|Sorry, can't let you get away with this.
Geralt|From what you say, they were asking for trouble.. I'll let it slide, this time. But kill any other humans, and I'll come back and cut off your head. Understand?
Troll_1|No. Words-a-words many. Hurt head.
Geralt|Lemme try again… Wham-a-Wham mans again, I'll swish-a-swash-a-swunk you.
Troll_1|Ah. No more troll wham. And this man take. For be good man and no swish-a-swash.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Found your miners. They went in a troll's cave and started mining… while the troll was home.
Skellige Old Man 02|Did any…?
Geralt|No. Troll won't be any more trouble, though.
Skellige Old Man 02|Small comfort…
Geralt|Still earned my reward.
Skellige Old Man 02|Yea, here… Safe journey to ye.
Geralt|Your miners are dead. Not one of you knew a troll lived there?
Skellige Old Man 02|We'd heard mention of it, but…
Geralt|But greed won out over reason.
Skellige Old Man 02|Not your place to judge us. What about the troll?
Geralt|Left him in peace - advise you to do the same.
Skellige Old Man 02|Turned coward, ye mean? What kind o' monster slayer are ye? Outta my sight.
Skellige Old Man 02|Greetings, witcher.
Geralt|Here about the missing miners. Might be able to help… What happened?
Skellige Old Man 02|Well, we'd heard tales o' silver in the northern hills. And seein' as coin's needed to ready longships for raids, we sent a few lads to see how much truth was in the tales… And, well, they've yet to return.
Geralt|Might not be much silver in the hills… but there are monsters, definitely. I'll see if the miners came across any.
Skellige Old Man 02|Thank ye, witcher.
Geralt|Gotta start by searching for them. That'll take time… and drive up costs.
Skellige Old Man 02|Long as they don't soar too high.
Geralt|Sorry… Not interested.
Geralt|Gave your offer some thought.
Skellige Old Man 02|And?
Geralt|Farewell.
Skellige Old Man 02|What am I, a dragon sleepin' on a hoard o' gold?! I won't pay ye that, not on your life!
Skellige Old Man 02|Hrmph! A bit overboard, that. But a deal seems close.
Skellige Old Man 02|I can throw in a few crowns more… For the good of our lads… I'll let it stand. Deal.
Skellige Old Man 02|From the Continent, that's plain to see. Greedy and eager to feed on the misery of others. Enough of the bandyin'! Take what's offered or piss off!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Hit a rich vein… But something went wrong.
Geralt|Miners' camp. Could find some clues.
Geralt|Footprints… human…
Geralt|Wounds caused by a blunt instrument… Rib cage smashed in.
Geralt|Someone crawled through here… with a broken leg.
Geralt|Wind didn't fell these trees… Something else did. Something big.
Geralt|Crushed bones. Human bones.
Geralt|Same injuries as the man in the woods…
Geralt|Extensive bruising and abrasions. Broken bones…
Geralt|Silver vein - what they came for, what they died for.
Geralt|A rock troll, looks like…
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Old Man 02|Knew from the start no ordinary man could handle the beast. But Sverre insisted, mustered a crew and…
Skellige Old Man 02|Only four came back. The rest massacred, east of the village. So, will ye help?
Geralt|I'll tend to the monster.
Skellige Old Man 02|Not your first, that's clear enough. Not like our lads… heads full o' fire but not a morsel o' thought 'tween 'em.
Geralt|The four survivors - where'll I find them?
Skellige Old Man 02|Aim to talk to Sverre? Maybe 'tain't a bad idea. They're sittin' over there, by that hut.
Geralt|Let's talk about my reward.
Skellige Old Man 02|Ye want to bargain? How would ye count it? Height in hands at the withers, or--
Geralt|Mm-mm. By species. Drowner's less than a cockatrice.
Skellige Old Man 02|Ah-hah! But we've no notion what prowls the high road! Whaddaya say ye cut it down, and then we'll talk…?
Geralt|Mm-mm. We pre-agree a price, define a bonus for unforeseen risks.
Skellige Old Man 02|Errr… so, how much?
Geralt|So long.
Geralt|Greetings. Saw your notice.
Skellige Old Man 02|Hah! And they said, "Why you hangin' that? Ain't no one else gonna hunt that beast." But I showed 'em.
Geralt|Any idea what kind of beast this is?
Skellige Old Man 02|Aw, ye hear all sorts o' things. The wenches clean the nets blather about koshcheys and manticores. But I reckon that's hogwash.
Skellige Old Man 02|We'd seek the council o' Freya's priestesses, we would. But how can we when we can't get to the shrine?
Geralt|And nobody's gotten a glimpse of the beast? From a distance, even?
Skellige Old Man 02|Oh, they have, they have - right close, closer'n boot and strap. Soon after their blood spattered the underbrush.
Geralt|Killed the beast that was troubling you.
Skellige Old Man 02|Merciful Freya, Whoreson's finally dead. Ptooey! Now, tell us - was it a tough fight? Got any wounds need dressin'?
Geralt|No, I'll be all right.
Skellige Old Man 02|Ahh, nothin' new to the likes of you. Hard work, witcherin'. Ah right, your reward… This here's for you.
Geralt|Thanks. So long.
Skellige Old Man 02|You - you're a witcher? I seein' right?
Geralt|Yes. Got work for me?
Skellige Old Man 02|If you're willin'… Some manner o' evil prowls about, got us scared to venture outta the village.
Skellige Old Man 02|So will ye help, then?
Skellige Old Man 02|Oh, that 'un would make quick work o' the beast!
Skellige Old Man 02|Hmph! That's what ye'd ask for a golden dragon, maybe! No chance!
Skellige Old Man 02|Ye knows how to bargain, grant you that. Drop it a bit more, we'll have deal.
Skellige Old Man 02|Argh, have it your way. 'Tis your neck on the line.
Skellige Old Man 02|Gods've taken all reason from ye! Ye can take the offer or sod off!
Geralt|Greetings.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Warrior 01|Oh, ask this witcher! He'll tell you monsters don't set traps.
Geralt|What's the issue?
Skellige Warrior 01|Ye or anyone ever heard of a beast settin' a wagon in the road, then waitin' in ambush? They're too ploughin' dumb for that, dammit!
Skellige Warrior 02|Dumb or no, they tore a few of our lads to shreds. And we ran like rats… They deserve to be buried…
Geralt|Willing to talk about it? Tell me what happened?
Skellige Warrior 01|Ask away.
Geralt|Remember what the monster looked like?
Skellige Warrior 02|It were dark. Kaspar thought he saw somethin', but--
Skellige Warrior 01|Cause I did!
Skellige Warrior 01|It was huge, its maw all blood-smeared! Bugger gutted Ungi with one claw, near spliced 'im in two.
Geralt|Hm, interesting. Thanks.
Skellige Warrior 01|Huh? For what?
Geralt|Word is you were ambushed. Tell me where?
Skellige Warrior 02|Short way from here, 'long the road to Lofoten. Saw a wagon cross-wise the road near the woods.
Skellige Warrior 01|We'd barely got to it when somethin' came rushin' through the underbrush and whoosh! Blood spurted in me eyes. I wiped it away, looked, saw Einar lyin' dead.
Geralt|Really thought you could take on this monster? On your own?
Skellige Warrior 02|We had to try. If we didn't, who would?
Skellige Warrior 02|Think Larvik's some kind o' getaway for mutants, witchers stoppin' in every week?
Geralt|Time I was on my way.
Skellige Warrior 01|Still here, witcher? Cut the beast down, have ye?
Geralt|Need to know more, first. Word is you're the only ones who've seen it and lived to tell.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Looks like blood but… Hm, red clay.
Geralt|Tracks - a nekker… A big one.
Geralt|An ambush… average nekker's too dumb to set one… maybe this is no average nekker.
Geralt|Nekker nest. Nothing left of it, but it could be connected to a bigger one.
Geralt|Pops mold. Can't go in without an antidote.
Geralt|Pops mold. Dijkstra's antidote should come in handy.
Geralt|If I follow them, I bet they'll lead me to the nest. Should be able to hear where they run…
Geralt|Found a good place for their nest.
Geralt|Hm, guess I got company.
Geralt|Hm, something really did tear him to pieces…
Geralt|Red clay and the tracks of an exceptionally large nekker. Definitely a warrior.
Geralt|Must be around…
Geralt|Tracks lead into the woods.
Geralt|Hm, nekker warriors use this clay to mark their position in the pack.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Boatbuilder 01|Listen, witcher… Got us some muire d'yaeblen, you know, drowners. Real problem. The kind your silver sword could most certainly solve.
Geralt|Lemme guess… They're tearing your nets, devouring your fish, and attacking the occasional lone boatman or tavern patron who walks home along the shore.
Skellige Boatbuilder 01|Were that the only harm… Terrors in the bay're meaner than on the Continent. They hunt come dusk or dawn. Attack fishermen wieldin' just oars and warriors alike. Sea tosses 'em up after… armor shredded, guts devoured.
Geralt|Strange… Any witnesses?
Skellige Boatbuilder 01|Rurik, my apprentice. He was on a boat the muire d'yaeblen attacked… There's Tove, too - her man was killed. She lives nearby, up a bit. Sorry, none other comes to mind. Those who see the beasts, meet 'em, well, they generally don't come back to dry land alive.
Geralt|I'll take the job. Dealt with drowners many times… It'll soon be over. Got my word on that.
Geralt|Let's talk about my pay, first. A bit too modest for my taste.
Geralt|Sorry. Can't take the job right now. Maybe later.
Geralt|Probably could… But I don't have time now. Sorry.
Skellige Boatbuilder 01|We've naught to talk about till ye kill those seafiends.
Skellige Boatbuilder 01|What'll it be, witcher? The muire d'yaeblen - will ye help us?
Skellige Boatbuilder 01|That much? For a couple of seafiends? Not a chance in hell!
Skellige Boatbuilder 01|That's just a bit high, master.
Skellige Boatbuilder 01|That's dear, it is… But could be worth it. All right, I'll pay ye what ye want.
Skellige Boatbuilder 01|Would ye rob me of me last crown? Won't let ye! We're done blatherin', you'll take the offer!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Another victim.
Geralt|That stench… Drowners for sure. Lair must be nearby.
Geralt|Crabs… Must be near the fishing ground Rurik mentioned.
Geralt|That stench again… Slime and rotting flesh…
Geralt|Ooh. More drowners.
Geralt|A monster's lair… but definitely not a drowner's.
Geralt|Almost untouched, hidden for later. Drowners just don't do that.
Geralt|Bruises on his neck, crushed larynx… Strangled.
Geralt|Bits of boats, torn sails, lines… Sailing decor, you could call it.
Geralt|That stench, the marks on the bodies… This must be a water hag's lair. Got a keen sense of smell. She won't come back while I'm here.
Geralt|Unless… She coexists with drowners… Maybe I could make an extract from their glands, cover up my scent.
Geralt|That should do it. Now for place to hide and wait. Behind those boats…?
Geralt|Human bones. Unbroken, but the marrow's been sucked out. Need a long, thin tongue for that.
Geralt|Rusty piece of armor. Falling apart in my hands…
Geralt|A pelvis, scratched up. Long, wide claw marks.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Got a monster problem in the area?
Skellige Boatbuilder 01|Aye, read my mind? Some seafiends got a lair in the bay. Grab folk off boats from time to time… Ye lookin' for work, maybe?
Geralt|Did it already. Here for my reward. Happened on a few drowners, true, but a water hag was the real problem. Her head get me anything?
Skellige Boatbuilder 01|Aye. Same sum I was ready to pay for the seafiends.
Geralt|Think I deserve more. Water hag's significantly more dangerous than drowners.
Skellige Boatbuilder 01|Not denyin' it, but my coin pouch ain't exactly bottomless.
Geralt|Neither is the sea. Plenty more filth ready to crawl up from its bottom. Might need my services again, and I won't stick my neck out for those who skimp on the reward.
Skellige Boatbuilder 01|Extortin' protection coin, eh? Take it, take all I got. And choke on it, you bugger.
Geralt|Thanks… So long.
Geralt|Job's done. Here's the proof.
Skellige Boatbuilder 01|Now why would I want a sea-- What the devil's that?!
Geralt|Water hag. An old, clever one. She was the danger.
Skellige Boatbuilder 01|Seen a lot o' ugly critters in me life - morays, lampreys, blobfish… But never nothin' like this! Your reward. Well earned, witcher, well earned!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|You Odhen?
Skellige Old Man 01|I am. Here about me sonny?
Geralt|Where should I look for your son?
Skellige Old Man 01|East o' here, 'midst the ruins of the fortress. He went there with some rogues from Faroe, met 'em at the tavern. They filled his head with nonsense 'bout some treasure. I said, "Sonny, Faroe folk are liars to a man, ye shouldn't fraternize with 'em"… But he knew better.
Geralt|How'll I recognize him? All I know's he doesn't listen to his father. Pretty typical for his age.
Skellige Old Man 01|His name's Olve. Cheerful lad, bit of a lisp. Nothin' special 'bout his looks… 'Cept last I saw him he was wearin' a yellow tunic. Lovely, none other like it in the village. Got it from me a year back on his birthday.
Geralt|That oughta do it. I'll look around… No promises, though.
Geralt|Been to the ruins. Your son's band - a fiend attacked them. They're all dead. Sorry.
Skellige Old Man 01|I told him, told him! Sonny, nothin' good can come of it, stay with your pa. Time for adventures'll come later!
Skellige Old Man 01|Take this… For avengin' him, at the least. And I'll pray… pray you never have to bury your own child.
Geralt|Let's talk about my reward, first.
Geralt|Sorry, can't take this on right now. Farewell.
Geralt|What is it?
Skellige Old Man 01|You're clearly a fightin' man with many journeys 'neath your belt… I'm in need of your help. You see, it's me sonny, I'm worried. Left home a fortnight back and hasn't returned… Will you see what's become of 'im, would you mind?
Skellige Old Man 01|Greetings…
Skellige Old Man 01|What? Master… Can't rightly believe Crach's got that in his coffers!
Skellige Old Man 01|Have mercy on an old man. Drop your price a few crowns.
Skellige Old Man 01|It's a lot… I'll need to borrow from kin. But you have it. Won't spare no coin for me boy.
Skellige Old Man 01|I don't care to bargain. Take what I offer, or I'll find another to look for me lad.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Fang and claw wounds all over the body… but those indicate feeding. He died from a blow to the head.
Geralt|Ate only the entrails. Fussy.
Geralt|Ran this way…
Geralt|Crossed to the other side.
Geralt|Yellow tunic… Must be Olve.
Geralt|Huh, the Faroe boys were right after all. There was treasure in the ruins…
Geralt|No Olve here. Maybe the fiend dragged him off…
Geralt|A fiend.
Geralt|Came this way, toppling trees.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|This monster - I'm intrigued. What kind of beast we talking about?
Jorund|It's a ghost, I think… Or some other nightmare. Haunts Eldberg, near the lighthouse.
Jorund|Started harmless. Lighthouse just stopped burnin' one night. Without that light, ships can't make Arinbjorn safely, so we sent two men to see what'd happened.
Geralt|Lemme guess. They didn't come back.
Jorund|Naye, they didn't. Mikkjal, the light keeper, he'd also gone missin'. So I gathered some lads, a rescue party, and off we sailed… As we neared the isle, I hit the rudder hard and turned 'round. I'd seen a wraith on shore.
Jorund|Must think me a coward. But… well, crude steel'd not do us much good there, I felt it in me bones. All I could think to do was to gather gold 'round the village for a reward. Help us and it's yours.
Geralt|Fine. See what I can do.
Jorund|Thank ye, Geralt. You're a good sort, oughta be said.
Geralt|Gotta say I like you, Jorund… But business is business. I'll need more than that.
Geralt|Lemme think about it.
Jorund|All right… Decide you're keen, ye know where to find me.
Geralt|Mhm. Been there. Does look serious… Go on.
Geralt|Saw your notice. Pretty bare. Can you tell me more? About the beast?
Geralt|Let's talk about the job again.
Jorund|I need no convincin'. So what'll it be? Willin' to help?
Jorund|That much? Oh Geralt... Doubt the jarl'd be prepared to spit that up.
Jorund|Hm… I can add a sum, but not near that much.
Jorund|Grand, let's call it that. Shake on it.
Jorund|Ye know, Geralt, I don't rightly believe we're headed for agreement. So ye either take the offer or the grief when the gold goes to another.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Villager 02|H-how did ye get here?!
Geralt|What do you think? It is an island.
Geralt|Where'd all those wraiths come from? Last saw something like this near Vergen when--
Skellige Villager 02|From nowheres! That's just it! Fire went out and wind died of a sudden. That's how it started. Came out here for oil, stepped outta the house, looked up - saw the mist risin'. Then the ghosts showed! Came straight at me!
Skellige Villager 02|Bolted back inside, hasped the door, and then I heard it - someone whisperin' me name. Mikkjaal, Mikkjaal! I look out… There's the wraith, big bugger, bigger than the rest. And cold flowin' from it, such cold the windows frosted o'er!
Geralt|I can try to help. First, though… a couple of questions.
Skellige Villager 02|Ask a hundred if you will. Just get me out of here!
Geralt|These ghosts didn't appear without reason. Something brought 'em here… Any ideas?
Skellige Villager 02|No clue. There's nothin' here! The lighthouse, me hut - just rocks besides! Even bloody drowners know there's nothin' for them on Eldberg!
Geralt|Strange… Need to look around.
Skellige Villager 02|Here. This key opens the lighthouse. Ye know, case ye want to look inside… Or ye need to run from somethin'.
Geralt|This wraith, the big one… Tell me more.
Skellige Villager 02|It… It seemed more clever'n the others. Like it knew. Knew everythin'.
Skellige Villager 02|Haven't helped much, have I? Sorry, only saw it once. It disappeared right after…
Geralt|Yeah, interesting… Well, time I was on my way.
Skellige Villager 02|Hey! Hey! Don't leave me here!
Geralt|You Mikkjal? The light keeper? Jorund from Arinbjorn sent me.
Skellige Villager 02|Phew… It's just you. Learn anythin'?
Geralt|Island's haunted by a penitent… Specter punishes the guilty for crimes, foul deeds.
Skellige Villager 02|But… I'm the only one lives here. And I've hurt no one! Troubled not a soul!
Geralt|We'll come back to that later. Just now, I need your help.
Skellige Villager 02|B-but what? I'm no warrior.
Geralt|Guessed that already. But a curse grips both you and this place, and only you can lift it. Luckily, all you gotta do is light the fire in the lighthouse. Penitent's invincible as long as darkness covers the island.
Skellige Villager 02|I-I-I can't go outside! It'll kill me. I can f-feel it. Mayhaps ye could…
Geralt|I'll escort you. Now no excuses. Grab some oil and let's go. Before I change my mind.
Geralt|Like luring ships onto the rocks, then looting the wrecks… Don't deny it. I found the letter.
Skellige Villager 02|Longboats sink every so often anyway. That's the sea! That's its nature! They sink near the isle, at least the cargo don't go to waste.
Geralt|Farewell.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Villager 02|D-did it work?
Geralt|It did. Still don't know what brought the penitent here, though… You'd best be careful.
Skellige Villager 02|I'd gladly thank you with words and gold. It's just my coin pouch is empty.
Geralt|I know the feeling. So long.
Geralt|It did. But that doesn't make the island safe… 'Cause you're still here. A light keeper who lures ships onto the rocks… Sheesh.
Skellige Villager 02|I made a mistake. I know this now. Swear by Freya and all the gods - never again!
Geralt|Best keep that promise. I ever hear of another ship, even a dinghy, running aground off Eldberg… I'll come back here, finish what the penitent started. Understand?
Geralt|Absolutely, never. Soon as we're done talking, you're gonna pack up and leave. For good. Understand?
Skellige Villager 02|But I… Mhm. I understand.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Mhm. Not your average mist.
Geralt|Wound on his back… He was running away.
Geralt|Almost managed to find cover. Almost.
Geralt|Ordinary specter… Killing it won't change a thing.
Geralt|Hey! Anyone there?!
Geralt|A penitent…? Good thing it hasn't appeared to me yet. Couldn't possibly kill it in this mist and darkness… Need that lighthouse working again.
Geralt|A letter…
Geralt|Well, well. Lighthouse has got a pretty dark secret.
Geralt|Ahh, no reward again. Gotta go to Arinbjorn. Could be a reward for the penitent there.
Geralt|Walls're covered in ash… No other signs of a fire, though.
Geralt|Hurry up! Don't know how long I can manage this!
Geralt|Light. Finally… Time to get this done.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Old Woman 02|Well, well. Another come to gawk at the dragon's victims. Perhaps I should start chargin' for the pleasure?
Geralt|Perhaps. I wouldn't pay you, though. See enough corpses in my line of work.
Geralt|I'm a witcher. Here because I took the contract for that dragon of yours.
Skellige Old Woman 02|Forgive me. I didn't know. How… How can I help?
Geralt|Where were the bodies found?
Skellige Old Woman 02|In the glade past the river. The lads… they liked that place, since they were tikes. They'd go there to catch hares.
Geralt|That's everything for now. Thanks for your help… and I promise to avenge them.
Geralt|Might not be easy for you, but I have to look at their injuries.
Skellige Old Woman 02|Least ye asked me permission, not like the others. If it'll help ye kill the beast… fine, do as ye will.
Skellige Old Woman 02|I've told you all. Please… leave me be.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Solved your problem.
Skellige Old Man 03|And…? That it? Tell me more! Did the dragon breathe fire? Spit venom?
Geralt|Yeah. And it had golden scales and smoke poured out its ass like it does out a chimney.
Skellige Old Man 03|Just like the skalds sing it… You've earned your reward.
Geralt|And the princess' hand. But I'll just take the coin.
Geralt|That was no dragon, it was a forktail. Looks similar, but it's smaller, less dangerous.
Skellige Old Man 03|Less dangerous, you say? Well, your reward ought to be less as well.
Geralt|Listen, we agreed to a specific sum.
Skellige Old Man 03|Aye… for a dragon! If I'd known it was some forkytail, I'd have killed it meself. That's that!
Skellige Old Man 03|Oh, a witcher! Here about the dragon, I reckon?
Geralt|Tell me about this… dragon. What it looks like, for instance.
Skellige Old Man 03|You don't know? What kinda monster slayer are ye? It's got scales, wings, claws… A dragon's a dragon! No point gabbin', just go kill it! 'Fore it makes more corpses!
Geralt|Witchers don't usually kill dragons, but I'll look into it. You said something about victims, right?
Skellige Old Man 03|Two brothers, Askel and Nilas. Went out to hunt, turned into prey. Wounds so horrible even I went weak in the knees when they brought them in. And I've seen my share of bloody harm - been on thirty-two raids, from Poviss to the mountains of--
Geralt|Fascinating story, I'm sure, but I'm more interested in these wounds. Can you describe them?
Skellige Old Man 03|Look for yourself. Family's only now preparin' the boys' funeral. Their corpses still lie in their home, at the village's northern end. But treat the bodies with respect, mind ye. As tradition demands.
Geralt|Let's talk about the reward… See, what you're offering for this dragon, usually get that much for a nekker.
Geralt|Lemme think about it.
Geralt|Given some thought to your contract…
Geralt|Found your dragon's nest. But I'll need bait to kill it. A sheep, for instance.
Skellige Old Man 03|Ah, I see. Gonna stuff it with sulfur?
Geralt|Ahh, another ally of the brave little shoemaker… No, I'll manage without sulfur. Just need a sheep. Unseasoned.
Skellige Old Man 03|Fine, there's one I can give ye… A bit mangy, but it'll do. Know how to get a sheep to move where you want? Gotsta drive it like a sheep dog. Go at it from the left, it'll go right. Go at it from the right, it'll--
Geralt|If dogs have figured it out, think I'll manage as well.
Geralt|Farewell.
Skellige Old Man 03|So will ye help with the dragon or not?
Skellige Old Man 03|What?! I'll not give ye that, one dragon or many!
Skellige Old Man 03|You're askin' a few crowns too many, master.
Skellige Old Man 03|It's a lot… But then a dragon's a lot, too. So be it. I accept!
Skellige Old Man 03|Enough. Take what I offer or leave it in peace! I'll find a lad, a few, who'll face the dragon for the glory alone!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Claw marks, bite marks… But no fire damage. Interesting.
Geralt|Pretty weak dragon. Couldn't lift a cow, just tore it up and left it here.
Geralt|Cow's blood… Might lead me to the lair.
Geralt|Bones shattered… fell from high up.
Geralt|A nest… A forktail's, looks like. But it's empty. No point waiting, gotta rustle up some bait.
Geralt|Giddyup, sheep. Move along, whoo-ah.
Geralt|Finally.
Geralt|Go on, sheep. Go frolic. You've earned it.
Geralt|You died for a good cause, sheep. Rest in peace.

Skellige Warrior 05|See you're not from 'round here. What's brought ye to Spikeroog?
Geralt|Heard you've got a job for a witcher.
Skellige Warrior 05|Aye, me sis's near drilled a hole in me gut, pesterin' me. I hung a notice, hopin' she'd let up.
Skellige Warrior 05|Truth be told, didn't really expect anyone to take an interest.
Geralt|What's this about?
Skellige Warrior 05|Me sister's betrothed - he's disappeared. Folk say he done a runner. Sis claims she saw a beast carry him off.
Geralt|Sensing you just don't believe your sister.
Skellige Warrior 05|They had their ups, they had their downs. Nils - thoroughbred skirt-chaser, and Britt's just not easy to be around.
Skellige Warrior 05|But family's sacred. Ye willin' to look into this?
Geralt|I'll see what I can do. Wanna talk to your sister, first off.
Skellige Warrior 05|Britt and Nils had their favorite spot - cliffs north of the village. Ever since he went missin', she's been wanderin' about there.
Geralt|Thanks, I'll go see her.
Geralt|Changed my mind.
Geralt|Finding Nils won't be easy. Reward you posted's not enough.
Skellige Warrior 05|Bring him home, and I'll spare no coin.
Geralt|Need to hear something specific - a sum.
Skellige Warrior 05|First you gotta tell me somethin' specific - what happened to Nils.
Geralt|Sorry, don't have time for this now.
Geralt|Found an old ekhidna in a cave on the shore. Tough beast, but I killed it.
Skellige Warrior 05|Treacherous, those caves. Folk used to make sacrifices to Melusine there.
Skellige Warrior 05|So Britt spoke the truth. An ekhidna nabbed her Nils.
Skellige Warrior 05|Feel like a damned fool, now, not believin' me own sis.
Skellige Warrior 05|Take this - hard work deserves payment.
Skellige Warrior 05|Witcher, would ye mind tellin' Britt what happened to her betrothed?
Geralt|Fine, I'll talk to her. It's the least she deserves.
Geralt|You should talk to her. She'll need her brother's support.
Skellige Warrior 05|Ahh… Ehh, never got on too well with her. But you're right - I oughta do this.
Skellige Warrior 05|So Britt spoke true! A beast took Nils!
Geralt|And killed him. Body's in the cave.
Skellige Warrior 05|I'll have to fetch it.
Geralt|Farewell.
Skellige Warrior 05|Master witcher!
Skellige Warrior 05|Well, then? Have any luck?
Skellige Warrior 05|Thanks again for your help, witcher!
Skellige Warrior 05|Have the gods forsaken ye?! I could get a whole village to do the searchin' for that!
Skellige Warrior 05|Well, now… Dunno… Would ye consider droppin' it a bit?
Skellige Warrior 05|Agreed.
Skellige Warrior 05|Bloody fuckin' hell, enough! Take what I'm offerin' or piss off!
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Woman 02|The gods take pity on me, for folk no longer listen…
Geralt|Need to talk to you.
Skellige Woman 02|Leave me be.
Geralt|Did you see Nils die?
Skellige Woman 02|I… I saw a shadow… Great wings, like a cloud passin' o'er the sky. Then I heard him scream.
Skellige Woman 02|Somethin' grabbed 'im, lifted 'im up, then flew off towards the caves on the shore. But he was alive! Screamin' my name…
Geralt|I'll look into it.
Geralt|Take care.
Skellige Woman 02|My Nils is dead… But he died a death befittin' a warrior. No one'll say again that he was untrue to me.
Geralt|Your betrothed is dead. An ekhidna captured and killed him.
Skellige Woman 02|Nils…
Geralt|This won't bring him back, I know, but I avenged him, killed the beast.
Skellige Woman 02|Thank you. Knew all along he was true to me. And so I'll vow to be true to him for the rest of me days.
Skellige Woman 02|Take this gold. 'Tain't much, but I want ye to take it.
Geralt|Thank you. Take any coin I can get. Doesn't come often in my profession.
Geralt|Thank you, but… I won't accept any coin from you.
Skellige Woman 02|Why do ye offend me so?
Geralt|Don't take it the wrong way. There're things even a witcher shouldn't take coin for.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Ugh, stinks of carrion. Necrophages?
Geralt|Siren tracks. A very big siren.
Geralt|Strange scale color… Not your everyday siren.
Geralt|Hmmm, an ekhidna.
Geralt|Drowners couldn't possibly lift Nils into the air.
Geralt|Dropped from on high. Wonder who this is?
Geralt|Nils. Gotta be. Some monster dropped him from high up.
Geralt|Britt wasn't lying.
Geralt|Melusine, the mad and dangerous lady of the depths.
Geralt|Clearly used to be worshiped here.
Geralt|Same scales as on the altar.
Geralt|Melusine cult didn't appear outta nowhere. Ekhidna's been living here a while.
Geralt|Went into hibernation some time ago, but it's awake now. And it's hungry.
Geralt|Oughta explore those caves Britt mentioned.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Well? What do you want?
Redanian Officer 01|What could I want of a witcher? Some geese herding? I know of a monster that needs slaying!
Geralt|What kind of monster are we talking about?
Redanian Officer 01|If I only knew… It was like this - got Radovid to hire me and my company, but he's been late with the pay the last weeks. And I'll be damned if we're to risk our lives for free. Like hell.
Geralt|Couldn't agree more, but you were gonna tell me about the monster.
Redanian Officer 01|Yes, yes. We arrived here, encamped, then it turned out some beast prowls the area. Snatches cows and the like. Reckoned we should help the local boys, so we grabbed our weapons and set out - me and Kurt one way, Gerd and Henk the other…
Redanian Officer 01|Gerd and Henk never returned. Whatever it was, it got 'em. Job's for a professional, clearly, so Kurt and me, we chipped in for a small reward, hoping someone's willing to help the locals, avenge our comrades in the process.
Geralt|Awfully noble of you.
Redanian Officer 01|Hah! Mercenaries - we've our honor, too! Well, master witcher, what will it be? Will you take the job?
Geralt|All right. Where do I start looking?
Redanian Officer 01|South of here. It's where we split up… it's where we last saw Gerd and Henk alive.
Geralt|Let's talk about the reward, about how it's just not enough right now.
Geralt|Took care of the beast already. It was a griffin. An archgriffin, actually.
Redanian Officer 01|In that case I'm grateful. Archgrateful! Your reward…
Geralt|Thank you. And in the future, try summoning a witcher before any blood's spilt.
Geralt|Hold up a minute. Recognize this? You accepted a contract - reward paid up front, and higher than what you paid me.
Redanian Officer 01|What am I meant to do? Business is what it is, and intermediaries deserve their due.
Geralt|What you're due is a punch in the face. Gold. Now.
Geralt|Some advice before you go… Don't ever try to cheat a witcher again. Ever.
Geralt|Lemme think about it. Take care.
Geralt|Monster's dead, I slew it. It was a griffin. An archgriffin, in fact.
Redanian Officer 01|Well? Any progress?
Geralt|You post the notice?
Redanian Officer 01|I did, indeed. Hans of Cidaris, mercenary captain. Know of a monster that needs slaying. You interested?
Redanian Officer 01|Will you tend to the monster or not?
Redanian Officer 01|What?! No chance!
Redanian Officer 01|A bit too much, mate… but just a bit. We might still strike a deal.
Redanian Officer 01|I'd 'ave gone to hunt the beast meself if I'd known you wanted this much. Hard luck. So be it.
Redanian Officer 01|Give me, give me, give me. Sound more like a beggar than a witcher. You'll get what I say, and this here's my final word!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Human.
Geralt|And again… A mortal wound, looks like.
Geralt|Claw marks, bite marks. Armor ripped to shreds…
Geralt|No sign of another corpse.
Geralt|Mhm. Flying monster. Gripped the second body in its claws. Didn't quite get everything to its nest.
Geralt|Piece by piece, follow the thread…
Geralt|Tracks end here. Damn birds must've picked the ground clean.
Geralt|But they've already found the rest of the corpse, probably. All I gotta do is follow the cawing.
Geralt|Thin rachides, sparse after feathers… Interesting.
Geralt|A lot of blood… too much for one body.
Geralt|An archgriffin.
Geralt|And the nest? Empty, except for leftovers.
Geralt|Well, well. They took on this contract before I did. Got the reward up front. More than they're paying me…
Geralt|Wake up, you whoreson.
Geralt|There it is.
<|endoftext|>
Gnome Man 03|Welcome, master witcher.
Geralt|Saw the notice. Let's say I'm interested.
Gnome Man 03|That's good. Grand, even. Name's Brean Hotsch. I posted that slip.
Geralt|Gonna need details.
Gnome Man 03|Course, 'course… Well, through a series of regrettable events, I came to own a spread of forest ripe for loggin'. Near Novigrad, at a distance from any roads, but quite near the port. Easy gold, right? Just hire some lumberjacks and count the coin.
Geralt|Meant details about the monster, not your business.
Gnome Man 03|It's all linked, see? I took on some dwarven loggers, but they came to me claimin' the forest's haunted. Thought them lazy, nothin' more. Then one day they went in the wood and only one returned.
Gnome Man 03|Said some forest devil'd attacked them.
Geralt|I'll take the job.
Geralt|This logger, where'll I find him?
Gnome Man 03|Around. Last I saw him he was drinkin' away his pay. Said he had to honor his dead comrades.
Geralt|Let's talk about my pay. 'Cause the current offer's just not enough.
Geralt|Here about the notice, the witcher contract?
Gnome Man 03|Ah yes, I did post one.
Geralt|I killed the leshen that attacked the lumberjacks.
Gnome Man 03|That's wonderful, grand even! I'll have to find some new loggers, but there's no shortage of folk lookin' for work.
Gnome Man 03|But… can I be certain no other leshen'll show?
Geralt|It's possible, I suppose. Have to find a witcher if it happens…
Gnome Man 03|Ah, yes, yes… Well, you're due a reward. I'm not the kind not to pay for a job well done.
Geralt|Farewell.
Gnome Man 03|How are things, master witcher? Doin' anythin' about the dead loggers? Any bread gonna come of this yeast?
Gnome Man 03|I know I've not offered a fortune, but what you ask is simply too much. Come down a bit, so we can settle this.
Gnome Man 03|Mm, you're not cheap, but I can see you've tried to be reasonable. We might still agree a price.
Gnome Man 03|Very well… Let us say that's a price I'll pay willingly.
Gnome Man 03|You're daft, plain and simple! Ought to be a tax collector, not a witcher. You'll do the work at the goin' rate, or find yourself an idiot to work for.
<|endoftext|>
Dwarf Man 02|Welcome, traveler. Drink with me, you cocksucker. Fuckin' knock back a few so's my mates'll rest peaceful.
Dwarf Man 02|Somethin' ploughed 'em up good… But I don't know what it was… Don't know who or what to curse…
Geralt|Talked to one Brean Hotsch. Told me all about your comrades' death.
Dwarf Man 02|Knoblicker… We tried to explain, some horror was prowlin' the forest. He refused to believe it.
Geralt|He's hired me. Wants me to find the beast that attacked you and your friends.
Dwarf Man 02|Is that so? Well, I take back what I said. Good man, Brean… though a halfling.
Geralt|Tell me about the attack. What do you remember?
Dwarf Man 02|We were makin' our way out o' the forest, loaded with wood like pack horses. All of a sudden, we heard a bloody howl. Like a wolf's, a pack leader's. We legged it, but then the cart wheel got stuck.
Dwarf Man 02|Magnus Richter hollered I should run to the hut for the crossbows. So I ran. Come back to the woods… Bloody ploughin' massacre. Couldn't tell me mates apart.
Geralt|Thanks. Really helpful, that.
Dwarf Man 02|Kill the bugger, will you?
Geralt|No time just now. Take care.
Dwarf Man 02|Oi… Good mates, they were… Gnarled, knotty… Drinkin' mates, loggin' mates, brawlin' mates…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Loggers' hut. Need to find the spot where they died.
Geralt|Cart tracks lead into the woods.
Geralt|Stone's grazed. Monster must've grown furious. Could be a leshen… if so, oughta find its totems nearby.
Geralt|There was a fight here. Two dwarves and… something big.
Geralt|A dwarf went this way.
Geralt|Wounded dwarf tried to flee. Bleeding heavily.
Geralt|Deep wound on his back. Bled to death.
Geralt|Roots pinned this one to the ground. So hard he suffocated.
Geralt|Everything says leshen, a young one. Must've arrived here recently. Need to find its totem.
Geralt|Lo and behold, a leshen's totem. Now to destroy it - oughta piss it off, make it leave its lair…
Geralt|Not a leshen's birds… False trail.
Geralt|Hm… Ordinary ravens, looks like. No sign of a totem.
Geralt|Crows serve leshens. Should find some near the totem.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Guard 03|Hm?
Geralt|I'm here about the contract.
Novigrad Guard 03|Ah. Well, a night patrol got massacred. Tough men, the lot, armed to the teeth. A beast, must be.
Geralt|Must? What makes you say that?
Novigrad Guard 03|If you'd seen the corpses…
Geralt|Bodies buried yet? Where?
Novigrad Guard 03|Orders were to burn 'em. Our medic was to take a look first - talk to him. He's at the docks now.
Geralt|See what I can do.
Novigrad Guard 03|We'll pay you. The boys and me, we pooled what we had for a reward.
Geralt|What did the corpses look like?
Novigrad Guard 03|I've not seen anythin' like it in my life, and I've seen a lot of corpses. Ever heard talk of folk who died in the deserts of Zerrikania? From the heat alone?
Novigrad Guard 03|These corpses came straight outta those tales.
Geralt|Let's talk about my pay first. I know what my services are worth.
Geralt|Guards were killed by a succubus.
Novigrad Guard 03|Su- succubus? In Novigrad? How? Light of the Eternal Fire protects the city!
Geralt|Must've gone out a few times recently…
Geralt|In any case, the succubus is dead. Here's proof.
Novigrad Guard 03|And here's your reward. As promised.
Geralt|Farewell.
Geralt|Anyway, succubus won't harm anyone anymore. Here's proof.
Novigrad Guard 03|Masterful work, witcher.
Geralt|Farewell.
Novigrad Guard 03|You might know the value of your services, but I know the limit of our funds. We're not rich men, just town guards.
Novigrad Guard 03|That's better, but still too much.
Novigrad Guard 03|All right… I believe I can pay you that. Provided, of course, that you do… well.
Novigrad Guard 03|Piss off! Offer stands as it was - take it or leave it.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|You're the medic…
Vampire Medic 03|What can I help you with?
Geralt|I'm looking into the dead guards. Heard you did autopsies.
Vampire Medic 03|Did their friends hire you? Good, I'm happy to help.
Geralt|Find any claw or fang marks on the bodies?
Vampire Medic 03|Fangs, no. Claws, not quite. Only scratches, fingernails most likely, from their adventures with whores…
Geralt|Thanks. Should go see the place where they were found.
Vampire Medic 03|Good luck.
Geralt|Last body - where was it found?
Vampire Medic 03|In a side alley, along the road from the docks to the brothel district. Someone had dropped it there in the middle of the night.
Geralt|Need to examine that spot.
Geralt|Heard the bodies were desiccated.
Vampire Medic 03|Do you believe a beast killed them? I don't. The bodies were dried out, but perhaps they'd tried to apprehend a mage, who cast a nasty spell on them?
Geralt|Was it dehydration?
Vampire Medic 03|Strictly speaking, no. Though I don't quite know what to compare it to.
Geralt|Nothing just now.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Heard about the murders? Guardsmen?
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|Many perish 'round here. It's the pleasure kills 'em.
Geralt|You're lying. I know it. Murderer's trail leads here.
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|I'll not take lip from you. If you're the tracker you claim to be, you can manage on your own. Farewell.
Geralt|Tell the truth.
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|The succubus… It draws customers, it's raised our takin's somethin' wonderful…
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|I know it's a threat, but… I don't know that it kills.
Geralt|A succubus. Where'll I find it?
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|I've placed it in a house nearby. Here's the key.
Geralt|Talk to me, or I'll come back with Temple guardsmen, see if they can't loosen your tongue.
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|You needn't go far to find some. Got a few in the rooms. I could have 'em summoned, but I venture they'll be far from thrilled by a stray botherin' 'em.
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|Don't threaten me. If you want to look around, be my guest. But I'll not tell you a thing.
<|endoftext|>
Succubus 03|Who are you?
Geralt|Ever heard of witchers?
Succubus 03|Have you come to kill me?
Geralt|You shouldn't have come here.
Succubus 03|Who ordains so?
Geralt|It's a human city, belongs to them. And I protect them from the likes of you.
Succubus 03|So it's true what they say about witchers - you're but murderers for hire.
Geralt|Dunno. Wanna talk first. Why'd you kill those guards?
Succubus 03|I was careless, let them surprise me. They wished to kill me, I had to defend myself.
Geralt|That it? No heartrending story about human hatred for all things different, all things strange?
Succubus 03|I'm not one to lie. Nor do I kill without reason.
Geralt|Gotta understand. I can't let it happen again.
Succubus 03|Yes. I saw murder in your eyes the moment you entered.
Geralt|You gotta leave the city.
Succubus 03|And what if I don't?
Geralt|I'll have to kill you.
Succubus 03|I despise change. How stupid of me to walk into an ambush, let myself be surprised.
Geralt|I'll have to lie about killing you. Usually I bring a trophy…
Succubus 03|Very well. Take this. And this - because I'm furious with you. Though I shall calm down once I'm away from this place.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Bodies were found here. Gotta look for clues, anything unusual.
Geralt|Hobnailed guards' boots. Unimportant.
Geralt|A child's footprints. Damn, lots of foot traffic.
Geralt|Shallow footprints, irregular stride… An old woman.
Geralt|Bare feet, uneven depth. Limping beggar, most probably.
Geralt|Hoofprints, clearly… A horse? Hm, no horse I know walks on two legs.
Geralt|Evidence all points to Crippled Kate's.
Geralt|Need to look around outside.
Geralt|Empty perfume vial, expensive. Neighborhood's a bit shabby for this.
Geralt|This is it. Hm… That's not normal.
Geralt|Charmed by a succubus? Gotta get in that house, see what's inside.
<|endoftext|>
Redanian Officer 01|Hm?
Geralt|Here to talk about the contract.
Redanian Officer 01|Contract? Ah yes, put my mark to something of the sort. Seems a creature's attacking lonely passers-by, abandoning their corpses in gutters around Oxenfurt.
Geralt|Isn't that something you should look into?
Redanian Officer 01|Perhaps, but we've a ploughin' war to win. Haven't got the time to clean gutters.
Geralt|I'll take the job. Need to hear some details.
Redanian Officer 01|You'll learn everything I know.
Geralt|Like to examine the victims' bodies.
Redanian Officer 01|A corpse is a corpse.
Geralt|I see the wounds, might be able to tell what kind of monster killed them.
Redanian Officer 01|Ask our sawbones - he'll know if the corpses have been burned or not. You'll most likely find him in the hut on the riverbank, our impromptu morgue.
Geralt|Won't give me any trouble with the reward, will you?
Redanian Officer 01|Nah. I want this out of my hair.
Geralt|Any witnesses to these attacks? Anyone see the beast?
Redanian Officer 01|Some woman survived an attack. They say she's not been sober since. I'd try the tavern in Oxenfurt if you're willing to try talking to her.
Geralt|Let's talk about the reward.
Redanian Officer 01|Acquit yourself well and you'll not be disappointed. Redanian army's no band of scruffs - we can afford to hire a witcher.
Geralt|Sorry, can't take the job right now.
Geralt|Wanna talk about the witchers' contract.
Redanian Officer 01|Am I to assume you've changed your mind? You'll tend to the matter?
Geralt|Killed the monster that was murdering folk. Turns out a katakan was prowling the city.
Redanian Officer 01|You speak true? But… what on earth's a katakan?
Geralt|A higher vampire. Particularly interesting case, this one.
Redanian Officer 01|How the hell could a foul beast be interesting?
Geralt|This one liked alcohol, had a hugely inflated ego, too.
Redanian Officer 01|What matters is you snuffed it out. Due some praise for that, witcher.
Geralt|So long.
Redanian Officer 01|I know guildsmen ought to be decently rewarded, but there you've gone too far. I don't have that coin.
Redanian Officer 01|I see you've taken a more reasonable tack. We're finally getting somewhere. But it's still too much.
Redanian Officer 01|Very well. That I can pay with a clear conscience.
Redanian Officer 01|I've heard enough. You'll take the offered rate, and if it's not to your liking, well, away with you.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|You the medic? I'd like to see the monster's victims.
Vampire Medic 02|Oh, yes. I've not had them burned yet, must get to that.
Geralt|You done autopsies yet? Intend to?
Vampire Medic 02|Why would I? Beggars and vagrants - every last one stinking of cheap wine.
Geralt|Mind if I have a look?
Vampire Medic 02|In point of fact, I'd prefer you didn't sniff around.
Geralt|Gonna make me come back with a written order?
Vampire Medic 02|Good grief, pushy, aren't we? Here - the key to the morgue. Look all you want.
Geralt|Know what? I'll come back.
<|endoftext|>
Redanian Townswoman 02|Oh… Will you buy a round for a victim of the beast?
Geralt|Tell me about the monster, how you were attacked?
Redanian Townswoman 02|I'd need another bottle to get through it.
Geralt|See, I'd rather you stayed… sober while we talked. Bought yourself that bottle later.
Redanian Townswoman 02|Have it your way.
Redanian Townswoman 02|I was leaving the inn that night. Might've had a drink or… five, but I'm sure I wasn't hallucinating.
Redanian Townswoman 02|Something down an alley called me name. It were dark, I couldn't see what it was, but… it wasn't no human. Of that I'm certain.
Geralt|What makes you so sure?
Redanian Townswoman 02|I just know. This thing grabbed the hem of my skirt, but I broke free and ran.
Geralt|That it? You didn't see much.
Redanian Townswoman 02|Don't believe me either, do you? Fuck you. Fuck you all!
Geralt|I think you'll tell me everything I need to know - bottle or no bottle.
Redanian Townswoman 02|Yes, I will.
Geralt|Some other time.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Where's that damned katakan?
Geralt|Which way'd it go?
Geralt|I can hear it.
Geralt|It's going to the hut by the river.
Geralt|A bracelet, pretty worn. Silver under the gilding. Too big for a woman's wrist…
Geralt|Attacker lost it, most likely.
Geralt|He was drunk, someone dragged him over the cobblestones. Fang marks on his neck - vampire sucked his blood.
Geralt|Vampire bites and the strong stench of alcohol. Just like the other one.
Geralt|Fondness for jewelry, wounds on the victims' bodies - everything suggests a katakan.
Geralt|Except this vampire likes the blood of drunkards. That's the way to lure it out.
Geralt|Once was a maid from Vicovaro, tight at night, she'd be loose come 'morrow, early in the morning!
Geralt|Another maid from Vicovaro, ploughed with pleasure and drank with sorrow, till early in the morning!
Geralt|Our third maid was not demanding, gave it up to any man standing, early in the morning!
Geralt|Katakan didn't hear it. I'll try another verse.
Geralt|All right, all right, sheesh…
Geralt|Damn it. Think I lost its trail.
Geralt|It figured out something was up. Gotta search blind, now.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Greetings, master.
Geralt|Here about the contract… Really got an imp problem? Or is that just an imp-erfection in the notice?
Novigrad Rich Man 02|You ought not jest, master witcher. I know the creatures are only to exist in fairy tales. Yet I saw one with my own eyes - as it stole from my stall!
Geralt|All right. So what's this imp look like?
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Like a mean, fat cat… But a very large one - this tall, see? And it walked upon its hind paws!
Novigrad Rich Man 02|So? Will you teach it a lesson with your silver sword?
Geralt|Relax, I'll help you. Small businesses are the foundation of a healthy economy, and so on, and so on…
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Thank you, master witcher. I don't know if this will be of use, but most recently the thief leapt over that wall and ran into a passageway… It was the last I saw of him and a few of my wares.
Geralt|Make it worth my while and I will. Demand for witchers is high, supply's low. I pick and choose my contracts these days.
Geralt|Lemme think about it. I'll let you know.
Geralt|What'd it swipe from you?
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Once it was bread, then a fish, then apples… Might not seem like much, but add it together and the business suffers! And I'm hardly alone in being pestered. It's nicked something from every stand in the square!
Geralt|Problem solved.
Geralt|Convinced the imp to go back to the countryside to tangle horse manes and piss in milk - as tradition ordains.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|And how would I know you speak the truth? No trophy, no reward.
Geralt|There better be one. Or you'll feel the invisible hand of the market smack you so hard you won't be able to sit down for a week.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|I'll give you half the agreed sum, no more. And I'll not do business with you again.
Geralt|That imp of yours? Turned out to be a doppler. Kept shape-shifting… Until I took its head.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|A doppler? Seems we've no means to rid ourselves of this scourge. We burn one, another appears. Accursed pests!
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Perhaps now they'll give the market a wide berth at the least. I thank you, master witcher - in my own name and the guild's.
Geralt|Farewell.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|So? Will you slay the pest?
Novigrad Rich Man 02|That much?! Surely you jest, sir.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|A bit much… But a compromise is in sight.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Fine negotiation on your part, master… So be it. We'll call it agreed!
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Time is coin, master witcher. And you waste it, squander it, sir! Take what I offer, or I shall find another to do the work!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Rare sight - an elf and a guard of the Eternal Fire having a friendly chat…
Elf Man 01|Friendly? Nothing further from the truth. This racist here has demanded to search me! For no reason at all!
Novigrad Guard 03|You's a nonhuman, I need no other reason! Lucky I didn't find anything on you. Now piss off to the woods, go play your flute!
Geralt|Nice scent. And here I thought Temple guards were unkempt boors.
Novigrad Guard 03|You dare insult an officer on duty? Let me give you some advice, mutant--
Geralt|Look who's talking! I know you're a doppler. And a kleptomaniac.
Novigrad Guard 03|Merchants put out a contract on me?!
Geralt|Argh. Always the same old shit.
Geralt|That was some pretty bad acting. Really oughta explore other career options. Petty theft, maybe?
<|endoftext|>
Dudu Geralt|P-please stop… I surrender.
Geralt|Might be able to look like a witcher, but that won't make you fight like one.
Novigrad Beggar 03|Yet donning your skin's enough to know what kind of man you are… what you feel…
Geralt|I'll spare you, but you gotta help me in return. I need you to assume someone's form - Caleb Menge's. I need you to sail to Temple Isle and--
Novigrad Beggar 03|What? I'll not do it! I'd never do it! You might as well kill me now, save me the torture Menge would put me through.
Geralt|Fine… Never mind. Just stop stealing, or I'll torture you myself. Now get lost.
Geralt|I don't kill 'em, true. But then, not everybody applies my rules, and not everyone's got my conscience. So start stealing somewhere else. Far from Novigrad, preferably. Golden age of dopplers ended here a while ago.
Novigrad Beggar 03|I know. But I thought they'd not catch me, I thought myself too smart. Serves me right. Might've learned this lesson the hard way. Time to go, somewhere far away… But first, take this - as a token of my gratitude. So long, witcher.
Geralt|You learned something, but not everything. I spare any monsters that aren't dangerous.
Geralt|Thing is, you attacked me. Unprovoked. So that doesn't apply to you.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Hey! Wait!
Geralt|Merchant was right… Actually does look like a giant cat.
Geralt|Looks like the imp dropped some loot.
Geralt|Jumped this wall? Nimble little beast.
Geralt|Dropped down into the moat. Trail ends here.
Geralt|Paw prints end here… boot prints start there.
Geralt|Could it be the puss in boots?
Geralt|Door's wide open… Interesting.
Geralt|A woman's blouse, a man's shirt, a child's shoes… But only one bed.
Geralt|Lavender… Strong scent. Enough to track him down.
Geralt|A letter? Well, well. Our imp's at least literate, if not outright educated…
Geralt|Ran away. Damn it.
Geralt|Stop already!
Geralt|A doppler. Explains a lot… And complicates matters. Need a good lead to track him down.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Yes?
Geralt|Count Kurt Dysart?
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Are you here regarding the contract? Hmm…
Geralt|Wanted to hire a witcher, didn't you?
Novigrad Nobleman 03|I did. But not just any vagabond… One hears all manner of stories about the lunatics of the School of the Cat. Which do you belong to?
Geralt|School of the Wolf.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Ah yes, a good one. I knew a witcher of this school. Barnabas? No… Though his name did begin with a B. Never mind. To the matter at hand.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Not long past, I acquired an estate east of Novigrad. I got it on the cheap, you see, the seller was very keen to be rid of it.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Now I've learned the building is said to be haunted.
Geralt|Goes to explain the seller's urgency.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|I do not believe in ghosts - it is that simple. But my men say the house shakes at night, walls crumble, why, even the floors move about.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Is there anything to be done, a remedy for this?
Geralt|Fine. I'm willing to investigate. How do I get there?
Novigrad Nobleman 03|An orchard adjoins the property. The house itself you should recognize easily - cracks cover its walls. Here's the key. And good luck.
Geralt|Let's talk about my reward first.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|I beg your pardon? Asking for coin already? But you've not done the job.
Geralt|Need to make sure it's worth my time.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Just look at that. Arrives in Novigrad and he's off his head in minutes.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Very well, how much do you believe this should cost me?
Geralt|So long.
Geralt|Not your concern… Lord Dysart. If you'd rather wait for another witcher, you're free to do that.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Hah! Calm and confident - this I like! To the matter at hand.
Geralt|School of the Griffin.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Then why does a wolf hang from your neck?
Geralt|Hard times - took whatever was available. Mind if we get down to business?
Geralt|House shouldn't give you any more trouble. A little renovation and it should be fit for you to move into.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Truly? Why, the estate's price just spiked sharply. What precisely was the problem?
Geralt|Earth elemental trapped in the cellar. It was just trying to get out, almost demolished the house in the effort.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Hm, far more interesting than a ghost, that's certain. The cellar you mentioned - is it in a state to be furnished?
Geralt|Hard to say.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|We shall see. Ah, your bounty - there you are. And farewell.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Ha, ha. That was rich. I could hire three witchers for that amount. Now that you've had your jest, how much?
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Hm… No. I'm afraid that's too much. But we're near a price I would consider reasonable.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Yes. Agreed.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Do you jest?! I shall give you what I consider reasonable and not a copper more! Any other witcher would do it gratis!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|So, this is the haunted house…
Geralt|Inhabitant clearly left in a hurry.
Geralt|Whole building's shaking… But a specter would've attacked me already.
Geralt|Air flowing through this crack. There's something in there.
Geralt|No one's been here in a while.
Geralt|Not the root of any ordinary plant. Must be magic.
Geralt|Hm, looks like a journal.
Geralt|Something clicked…
Geralt|An earth elemental. Pretty powerful, too.
Geralt|Almost managed to break its magic bonds. A few days more and it would've wreaked havoc all around.
Geralt|Ceiling would've caved in if not for this support.
Geralt|I was sure that would collapse on my head.
Geralt|Wall seems a little thin.
Geralt|Gotta go deeper. Need to open the passage somehow.
Geralt|Old and congealed. Wonder if this is where the witch hunters caught up to the mage…?
Geralt|Scattered salt… Probably to drive ghosts away. Huh, pointless superstition.
Geralt|Gotta free it first… Then defeat it.
<|endoftext|>
Halfling Man 01|Holofernus Meiersdorf, at your service. Meet my sons, Bernie, Franklin and Hugo.
Geralt|Nice to meet you. Geralt of Rivia.
Halfling Man 01|I know who you are. Recognized the hair. Truth is, I've been waiting for someone like you.
Halfling Man 01|Something's destroyed our fields and hives. We think it's… the apiarian phantom.
Geralt|You do realize this "apiarian phantom" - well, there is no such thing. It's a monster. Gotta be. A wraith, maybe. Any of your workers see anything?
Halfling Man 03|I did. I was cleaning a hive when I heard a farmhand cry out. Screamed as though he'd been stung by a whole swarm all at once. I ran to him, but he was dead.
Geralt|Any stings on him?
Halfling Man 03|None. He looked like he had… frostbite. Blue lips, frost in his hair. And dead bees lay all around him.
Geralt|Where'd the phantom appear - can any of you show me?
Halfling Man 03|I'll go. Come with me.
Geralt|Just remembered - I left a cauldron of soup on the fire…
Halfling Man 01|Ahem, of course, I understand. Well, if you change your mind, that is, once you've had your soup and feel like tending to the apiary phantom, I'll be here, waiting.
Halfling Man 01|Soup again? You witchers do eat a great deal… Well, so be it, if you change your mind and want to face the phantom, you know where to find us.
Geralt|Saw the frozen hive. Found some tracks leading to the neighboring lot. Unfinished building there… tried to get inside, but the door was locked.
Halfling Man 01|We started building that home for Bernie, but ran out of coin and had to stop. Do you think the phantom's hiding in there?
Geralt|Don't know, but I should check. Can I get the key?
Halfling Man 01|Here.
Geralt|Stay inside until I return.
Geralt|As far as my reward's concerned…
Geralt|Worried about the "apiarian phantom"? Saw your notice.
Halfling Man 01|That's right. He's ravaging my hives.
Geralt|Hm… Any relation to Rico Meiersdorf?
Halfling Man 01|Ugh, ehh, yes. My youngest son. Sadly, he fled the family business. Went to seek fortune in the big city.
Halfling Man 01|But that's a long story, and I'm in need of help. From one like you.
Geralt|Namely?
Halfling Man 01|Well, you're a witcher, right? I'm looking for someone who can drive off or kill an apiarian phantom. One is ravaging my hives.
Halfling Man 01|Why do you ask? Do you know him?
Geralt|Ahem, well, yeah, we've met… But that's not why I'm here. Came about the notice you posted.
Halfling Man 01|It's the apiarian phantom. It's ravaging my hives.
Halfling Man 03|This way, follow me.
Geralt|Where'd you get the idea it was an "apiarian phantom"?
Halfling Man 03|It's a beekeeping superstition. You mismanage the bees' offerings, the phantom appears.
Halfling Man 03|He destroys the hives and kills the bees so that no one can use these noble creatures for ignoble purpose.
Geralt|Sicced your bees on the competition, eh?
Halfling Man 03|No. Father recently signed a contract with the Redanians.
Geralt|So the phantom's from Nilfgaard…
Halfling Man 01|You're our one hope. Drive off the beast - I'll reward you generously.
Halfling Man 01|Welcome to Honeyfill, traveler.
Halfling Man 02|This is the place. Here's where the phantom killed the farmhand.
Geralt|Maybe it left some tracks.
Halfling Man 01|Oh, you're back. Have you changed your mind? Will you vanquish the apiarian phantom?
Geralt|Told you already - no such thing.
Geralt|Farmhand who died - what'd you do with the body? Wouldn't mind a look.
Halfling Man 01|Too late for that. We buried the poor fellow a few days back.
Halfling Man 01|Ooooh, no, that is not an amount we can spare.
Halfling Man 01|Hm… Honeyfill's not been generating the revenues of old since the phantom appeared… Would you be willing to reduce your price?
Halfling Man 01|Ahh, as you wish. Fail to rid us of the phantom, and we'll go belly up anyway. I shall look upon your fee as an investment.
Geralt|So it's a deal?
Halfling Man 01|It is, it is.
Halfling Man 01|Enough! We might have been well off once, but our funds are far from abundant now. You must take what we can give and drive the phantom away. Or I shall find someone else to do the job.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Covered in frost. Cold must've killed the bees.
Geralt|Apiarian phantom's got large feet… And it's pretty damn heavy.
Geralt|Blood… Dried and blackened, so several days old.
Geralt|Must be where the farmhand died.
Geralt|Tracks disappear in the water. Doubt anything's hiding in this puddle they call a lake.
Geralt|Need to check the other side, see if the trail goes on.
Geralt|Show me a pond, and I'll show you the drowners. But they didn't destroy the hives.
Geralt|Can't squeeze through here. Gotta find another way in.
Geralt|Hmm… Whoever's building this probably lives nearby. I should talk to them.
Geralt|Clear paw prints. Left by something large and heavy.
Geralt|Hm… Wonder where these clues'll lead me…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Your apiarian phantom was a hound of the Wild Hunt.
Halfling Man 01|Eternal Fire! Hounds run with the Wild Hunt as well?!
Halfling Man 02|About two weeks back I woke suddenly in the night. Saw the Hunt streaking across the sky!
Geralt|Hound must've gotten separated then. Couldn't go back, so it hid in the empty house.
Geralt|I roused him out, but he got away.
Halfling Man 01|Got away? Do you mean he could return? Ooph, that is not what we hired you to do. Job's only half done - you're entitled to half the pay.
Geralt|Good enough for me. Farewell.
Geralt|It's hardly compensation for your losses, but at least the hound won't destroy any more hives.
Halfling Man 01|Thank you, witcher! It's true, nothing like hiring a specialist!
Halfling Man 02|How did you fare?
Halfling Man 04|Did you drive off the phantom?
Halfling Man 01|Enough for today, boys. Let's go home. We've a big day tomorrow - must rebuild the hives the hound destroyed.
Halfling Man 04|Work and more work - never-ending story…
Halfling Man 02|Strange that witcher couldn't vanquish the hound.
Halfling Man 01|Well, he did what he could. We all trip up sometimes.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Old Woman 01|Greetings, witcher.
Geralt|Seems your White Lady's a noonwraith.
Novigrad Old Woman 01|That means… Gods. Poor Luzi!
Geralt|Luzi… She was gonna marry, right?
Novigrad Old Woman 01|Yea. Her parents swore her to a smith from the city. Well-to-do, sure, but older and more brittle than elven ruins. Luzi ran from the altar out into the fields…
Novigrad Old Woman 01|Where she slashed her veins. Used the silver dagger she'd gotten for the betrothal. Wait… let me show you.
Novigrad Old Woman 01|Luzi's parents couldn't bear to sell it, bury it, even. They left it in my care.
Geralt|I wanna send her away, but I've gotta bring her close, lure her, first. I need an object that belonged to her. Dagger would be perfect…
Novigrad Old Woman 01|Take it, but… kill Luzi, promise me. She shouldn't suffer no more.
Geralt|Problem solved. You can go back to your fields.
Novigrad Old Woman 01|Thank you. Your coin… And may fortune smile upon you.
Geralt|Here about the White Lady.
Novigrad Old Woman 01|As I hoped. My notice has been hangin' so long, sun's near bleached it blank.
Geralt|Managed to decipher it, somehow… But I need more information.
Novigrad Old Woman 01|Ask away. Afraid to go out in the fields anyway, for fear of endin' up like Micko and his band.
Geralt|Micko and his band - who're they?
Novigrad Old Woman 01|Four lads, drunkards and good-for-nothin's, all. They'd drained a few pints and decided they'd all plough the White Lady, maybe then she'd bugger off.
Geralt|Romantics.
Novigrad Old Woman 01|Mhm. Seems the White Lady spurned their advances. They still lie in the field… Folk're afeared to bury 'em.
Novigrad Old Woman 01|So… will you save us from her?
Geralt|Yeah, I'll take care of it… using more effective means than brave Micko.
Geralt|White Lady can wait. Let's talk about my pay first.
Geralt|Need to think it over.
Geralt|So, the White Lady haunts your fields?
Novigrad Old Woman 01|True, just past the hut, near the ol' tower. Folk say she's made her home there.
Geralt|Farewell.
Novigrad Old Woman 01|So what'll it be? Will you help?
Novigrad Old Woman 01|Oh! Master witcher…! If I had that much coin, you think I'd still be workin' the fields?
Novigrad Old Woman 01|Hm. It's too much… Come down a ways, and we might agree.
Novigrad Old Woman 01|Oh, so be it… I can toss in that bit.
Novigrad Old Woman 01|You tryin' to fleece me? I'm a simple woman, but it don't mean I can't count. We've "bargained" enough. You'll get what's offered and that's that.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Not a trace of decay. And it's been lying in direct sunlight.
Geralt|Whatever he saw just before he died… gave him quite a scare.
Geralt|Pale skin, but no blood loss. This is no vampire.
Geralt|Hard-headed men…
Geralt|Expected to see four bodies.
Geralt|Deep, uneven tracks. Someone fled blindly, in a panic.
Geralt|Met the same end as the others.
Geralt|If the Lady's linked to this tower, it's worth a visit.
Geralt|Strange. As if a whirlwind came through.
Geralt|Right. The ghost of a bride-to-be… A noonwraith.
Geralt|Maybe there's a reward for her?
Geralt|Oh, yeah. Noonwraiths never come out after dusk.
Geralt|Gotta toss some mistletoe in the fire, too. Wraith won't come out otherwise.
Geralt|No injuries. Killed by magic.
Geralt|She's avoiding me. Gotta find something that belonged to her, she'll have to show, then.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|Reconsidered my terms yet? Shall you afford me the respect I am due?
Geralt|Fine… Monsieur de Boorbeau.
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|The emphasis falls on the last syllable. Bour-BEAU.
Geralt|Mhm. See now, I'd rather emphasize something else - tell me what this is about, monsieur, or I'll change my mind and go.
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|Nordlings and their manners… Very well, let us get this over with - something has infested my vineyard.
Geralt|Mhm. Great, lemme go prepare my "something" oil, then.
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|I beg your pardon?
Geralt|Need more information than that. Where was this "something" seen? Any witnesses? Bodies to examine?
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|Therein lies the rub - none has seen the beast. We've only heard signs of its presence - a strange… scratching and shrieks. Neither are there any corpses to inspect… Men simply disappear without a trace.
Geralt|Noises you mentioned - where do they come from?
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|Well…. everywhere!
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|But they're most clearly audible in the wine cellar.
Geralt|Means the monster must dwell underground… Hmm. When're the noises loudest?
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|In the night. Just as they were years ago, when the buildings quaked. Another expert agreed to look into the matter then - but was never thereafter seen nor heard of.
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|Oh, that should suffice with the questions. Now tell me, will you take the contract - yea or nay?
Geralt|Fine. I'll do it. Need to look around here, first. Then I'll want to talk to Madame de Bourbeau.
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|Very well. I shall inform you once she has returned. Meanwhile, the key to the cellar. Just, whatever you do, please do not disturb the wine barrels!
Geralt|Depends. What kind of reward are we talking about?
Geralt|Hm. Gotta think it over.
Geralt|Who's disappeared, if you don't mind my asking?
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|Hm. Most recently, some farmhand, I believe.
Geralt|Despite the vast difference in social status, you remember the farmhand's name, maybe?
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|No. You must speak to my wife, she has more collegial relations with the household help… She's away at the moment, visiting her mother, but should return forthwith.
Geralt|Despite the vast difference in your social statuses, do you perchance remember the farmhand's name, monsieur?
Geralt|Listen, friend, there's an enormous difference between us but it's not about status. It's about me having two swords on my back, and you having none.
Geralt|So I'll call you whatever I want. And you either deal with that or solve your monster problem yourself.
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|The gall! I shall file a complaint with your guild!
Geralt|Mhm. Make sure you address it to Customer Service, Kaer Morhen, Kaedwen.
Geralt|Now talk. Before I change my mind and go.
Geralt|Hm. If that's how you wanna handle things, so long.
Geralt|Ah, you the one posted the notice? Go on, then, spit it out, what's it about?
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|Ah-ah-ah! First, my dear witcher, we must establish ground rules. Given the vast difference in our respective social positions, I'm sorry to say I take umbrage at the familiar tone you take.
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|I expect deference. I expect you to address me as "sir," or, better yet, as Monsieur de Bourbeau.
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|So, shall you accept the contract? Yea? Nay?
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|Hm. Fine, seems I must take the loss. Agreed.
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|Enough! You shall take what I offer, or I shall seek out another slayer of vermin!
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|Come now! Be reasonable!
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|H-how much? Do you jest?
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|You've taken up enough of my time. You were to go to the cellar!
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|Hullo, there! Come here!
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|Might we speak?
Geralt|Yeah? What is it?
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|Now why does one summon a witcher, hm? To inquire about the gossip currently flowing about the court? I've a problem with a beast.
Geralt|Right, all ears, then. Tell me about the monster.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|Sackrayblue!
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|What is the meaning of this?! I'm paying you to slay a monster, not demolish my property!
Geralt|Property's falling apart on its own what with all the tunnels under it. I'd fill those in soon if you don't want your building to collapse.
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|Tunnels?! Fiddle my fum, how did tunnels appear down there?!
Geralt|Something dug 'em, a large creature. Also killed a few kikimores down there. They'd managed to lay eggs, already. Consider it a half favor, won't cost you much.
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|Did you exterminate them all? Did you burn the eggs? Thought not. I'll not pay you a copper. I must send men down there to deal with the filth as it should be dealt with.
Geralt|Ahem… Madame de Bourbeau, I presume? Hear you know something about the missing farmhand.
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|Jean-Luc? Yes… We went to examine this year's seedlings, something had been nibbling at them. Then we heard these odd noises. Jean-Luc went to reconnoiter… and never returned.
Geralt|Where'd you last see Jean-Luc, madame - exactly?
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|In… in the fields, north of here, by the wood.
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|New seedlings, there? I was under the distinct impression we had planted them all on the south slope…
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|Almost all, my dear. I requested that some be planted to the north, by the grove. Just the remainders.
Geralt|Hmm. Should be enough to go on.
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|Then what are you fritting around here for?! Get to work!
Geralt|Madame, could you describe Jean-Luc?
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|Tall… exceedingly well-built… hair black as pitch…
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|Dear, concentrate. There is not a peasant that is not well-built - they work in the fields all day. He means scars, birthmarks - that sort of thing!
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|Hm… Then none, I suppose, but… he did wear a pendant around his neck. A silver one.
Geralt|Silver jewelry? On a farmhand?
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|It was a gift, I believe. Or, that is what he claimed.
Geralt|Something dug 'em, a large creature. Also, killed a few kikimores down there and destroyed their eggs. Consider it a half favor, won't cost you much.
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|Kikimore eggs? Yes, of course, good work… Indeed, a reward is due.
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|Still here?! But why?! Seek the beast!
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|Please. Find Jean-Luc.
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|Hmm. Perhaps I can turn these tunnels into an extended cellar?
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|Do you see this? He demolished the wall! Obliterated it! Let a churl into your home, and look what happens!! Just look!!
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|Darling, calm down…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Water coursing. Underground stream?
Geralt|No kikimore dug this. Tunnels're the work of something much bigger… Something with heavy, wide claws.
Geralt|Cracked kikimore eggs. Something's been feeding on them.
Geralt|Dammit! It's getting away!
Geralt|What the--?!
Geralt|A tunnel? Hmm…
Geralt|Wall almost collapsed.
Geralt|Rats. Not known to kidnap farmhands.
Geralt|Shattered dishes. Got knocked off the shelf somehow…Shaken off, maybe…?
Geralt|A kikimore nest… Completely destroyed. Monster I'm looking for must eat them.
Geralt|Goes on and on, this tunnel.
Geralt|Should be able to break through.
Geralt|All right, let's look around.
Geralt|Tunnels - not the work of kikimores, that's certain. Too big for any insectoid.
Geralt|Where's this go?
Geralt|Getting more interesting by the minute.
Geralt|Hmmm… monster I'm looking for lives underground, digs tunnels, feeds on kikimores… and is big. Very big.
Geralt|Won't learn anything else here. Time to go back to the surface.
Geralt|Kikimores?
Geralt|It's quiet… Guess the monster actually is nocturnal. Gotta wait till dark.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|You'd best be bearing good news. Get on with it.
Geralt|Got rid of the beast that was giving you trouble. It was a shaelmaar.
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|Sh-shaelma? What ever could that be?
Geralt|Hmm… Kind of like a cross between a mole and a caterpillar. Just… big as a barn.
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|Gulp. Ah. Uh-huh.
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|Well, master witcher… you make a poor first impression but ultimately proved your worth. There, your reward.
Geralt|As for Jean-Luc… afraid he's dead. Sorry.
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|Who? Oh, him… Trivial as losses go. I shall soon find another to take his place.
Geralt|Right, after all, he is just a peasant, not a Monsieur de blah-blooh-blah. So long.
Geralt|Yeah… As will Madame de Bourbeau, I bet. So long.
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|Now, forgive me. I must speak to my wife.
Geralt|This Jean-Luc, he did have a silver pendant. Kept a lock of Madame de Bourbeau's hair in it, matter of fact.
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|What? But… how could she?! To be unfaithful to me, a lord and heir… with a plough-spawned peasant?! Oh, she shall pay for this!
Geralt|Don't doubt that. But, mind paying me first? For services beyond the scope of the contract…?
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|There. It'll come out of her dowry.
Geralt|We'll talk. Later.
Geralt|Monsieur de Bourbeau? Can we talk?
Geralt|You. Can we talk?
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|The wall - fix it! By the end of the day!
Toussaint Wine Merchant 01|Our business. Adieu, sir.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|So… have you… have you found him?
Geralt|Found this.
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|Jean-Luc…
Geralt|Sorry. Really, I am.
Geralt|Lock of hair inside… it's yours, isn't it?
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|Yes. Jean-Luc and I… Well, I'm certain you've pieced it together already.
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|I thank you… for your discretion… for… avenging him. Please, it's terribly modest, I know, but you must take this reward… My husband is certain to be miserly with his gold. Now, if I may… I'd like to be alone.
Geralt|Hm. No, not yet.
Toussaint Worker 02|Folk say some large armored mole tunneled beneath the foundations.
Toussaint Worker 02|It's why things are toppling.
Toussaint Worker 01|A blind giant, this damned beast. Meandered all about.
Toussaint Worker 02|Quite a bit of stone and brick work awaits.
Toussaint Worker 01|That it does.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Man's footprints lead here.
Geralt|Someone had a picnic. Or something.
Geralt|Trail leads to that cave…
Geralt|Gonna have to brew some bait. Need the blood of a recent victim and some of the mushrooms that grow here.
Geralt|Gotta spill it within the lair… somewhere near an air current, so the scent spreads throughout the cave.
Geralt|Ugh. That stench!
Geralt|Now just gotta chop off its head… and go get my reward.
Geralt|Good vintage. Must've been a special occasion.
Geralt|Something walked through here. Big bastard. With a heavy tail.
Geralt|Dead end… except… looks like there might be something down there.
Geralt|Dead end…
Geralt|Silver pendant… a lock of hair inside. Same color as Madame de Bourbeau's…
Geralt|Footprints. Two sets.
Geralt|Blood… Human.
Geralt|A foot… been gnawed on. Not good.
Geralt|Large, deep tracks.
Geralt|Felled trees? As if something… rolled over them. So a shaelmaar. Only they dig tunnels and move like that.
Geralt|Fresh corpse. Must be Jean-Luc.
Geralt|Crushed ribs, cracked skull… Shaelmaar did this, no two ways about it.
Geralt|Whoa-ho. Shaelmaar's close…
Geralt|Claw marks. Straight, dull… perfect for digging. Hm.
Geralt|Piece of a carapace… Horned, gray shell.
Geralt|Shaelmaar's lair, gotta be… Drags its victims here. Pretty fresh, some of 'em.
Geralt|Kikimore eggs.
Geralt|Should destroy them before the young hatch, start prowling the vineyard.
Geralt|Dammit… young could hatch any minute.
Geralt|Last one.
Geralt|Shaelmaar'll be here any minute…
Geralt|Highly decayed, partly eaten… been lying here a while.
Geralt|Gotta find the lair. Must be deeper…
Geralt|Tracks split. Woman turned back here, man kept going.
Geralt|Trail ends here. Looks like she went back to the manor.
Geralt|Blanket was laid out here.
Geralt|Scent won't spread from here.
Geralt|Need to spill the bait nearer the tunnel entrance.
Geralt|Shaelmaar droppings. Grubs that feed on them are a delicacy to giant centipedes.
Geralt|Wonder what lured the giant centipedes.
Geralt|So, missing workers. This is what became of them.
Geralt|Bread's really stale. Been here a while.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Sharpened its claws. Or just marked off its territory.
Geralt|Long claws. Downright impressive.
Geralt|Strangled its prey. Then started feeding.
Geralt|A strangler. Strange - didn't consume its prey.
Geralt|Smashed bones - that takes strength. No point in trying to parry its blows.
Geralt|Smashed bones. Damn, it was strong.
Geralt|Bruises. Beaten to death. No sign of fangs or claws.
Geralt|No cuts, no bite marks. Just bruises.
Geralt|Thin and deep cuts. Not unlike a razor…
Geralt|Long, sharp claws, this one…
Geralt|Rips apart its prey like a striga.
Geralt|Damn. Ripped to shreds.
Geralt|Hair turned completely gray. Scared witless, probably.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Yen and I went to Hindarsfjall.
Ermion|Oh! Did you learn anything?
Geralt|Ciri came through Lofoten. She was wounded when she arrived. Villagers nursed her back to health.
Geralt|Sadly, the Wild Hunt was on her trail, followed here there. Ciri managed to escape, but the villagers--
Ermion|I know. You needn't finish. I later spoke to those who survived.
Ermion|Suffice to say Ciri was fortunate to escape. I trust you'll find her soon.
Geralt|What do the druids think of Skellige's new ruler?
Ermion|An Craite blood is good blood.
Ermion|Yet Cerys is the first woman to rule Skellige. Ever.
Geralt|Not everyone's pleased?
Ermion|There are seven clans in Skellige. Each would like a king from their own line. But Cerys will manage.
Ermion|She's not as impulsive as Hjalmar. Thinks first, then acts. With Crach as her advisor, she has every chance to be a good queen.
Ermion|Hjalmar is a good warrior. We shall soon see what kind of politician he will make.
Geralt|Betting he'll listen to his father's counsel. And probably sink any possible accord with Nilfgaard.
Ermion|That is certain. As long as any an Craite sits the throne of Skellige, there is no hope for peace with Nilfgaard.
Ermion|Svanrige will be but a tool in his mother's hands.
Ermion|I've long said Birna would never relinquish power after Bran's death.
Geralt|Shoulda claimed the throne for herself. Why didn't she?
Ermion|There are those who act openly, those who prefer the shadows. Birna is clearly one of the latter.
Ermion|I expect in the end she will cross the clans, encourage feuds between them, then try to parley with the emperor.
Geralt|Emperor signing a treaty with Skellige? Doubt it somehow.
Ermion|It's possible, though not as equal with equal.
Geralt|You were made a hierophant. Congratulations.
Ermion|I thank you. The Skellige Circle chose me years ago, about the time when the old disputes between the clans were reigniting.
Geralt|Job's been mainly politics, then?
Ermion|Aye, but I've not minded. Since time immemorial the druids have wandered betwixt the clans, keeping endless feuds in check.
Ermion|We care for equilibrium, the balance of all things, not just trout populations in streams. We're lucky the jarls always valued us as advisors.
Geralt|The war - curious to know your opinion.
Ermion|Well… I believe Emhyr's chosen a poor time to wage it.
Geralt|Hard to find any better, as I see it, with the North now in disarray.
Ermion|The North is weak, true, but I've the impression the emperor's dealing with some domestic strife. Far too much to start a war.
Ermion|Radovid is a madman, but a cunning one. He's certain to take advantage.
Geralt|Farewell.
Geralt|Can we talk?
<|endoftext|>
Ermion|Hm, like wine, better and better with age… Your sword skills, I mean.
Ermion|Are you… well? Not too hurt, I trust?
Ermion|I might look young… but I can't possibly keep up if you continue to scurry hither and thither!
Ermion|Ohhh, I'd be terrified to face you in battle.
Ermion|I've lived ever so long… but never seen swordwork quite like that.
Ermion|That was close. A hair away from my having to dig your grave.
Ermion|Hmph. I see witchers have their slumps as well…
Ermion|What are you doing?! Why?!
Ermion|Careful!
Ermion|Ahem.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Fine, I'll help you. Just… been a few days since the battle. Chances we find your brother alive're slim. Very slim.
Temerian Peasant 02|Who would've thought. But… I want to find his body, at least. So Bastien don't rot there in the sun with the Black Ones.
Temerian Peasant 02|Meet me on the hill overlookin' the battlefield. We'll move on together from there.
Geralt|Sorry. Can't help you.
Geralt|Do that often? Talk to your dog?
Temerian Peasant 02|It's my brother's, Bastien's. But… guess he's mine now.
Temerian Peasant 02|See… Bastien fought the Black Ones in a battle - just outside the village. Haven't had word of him since.
Temerian Peasant 02|I told him - do like I did, lose a finger or two so they won't recruit you. Too damn afeared, he was. Bloody hell…
Geralt|I'd walk the battlefield if I were you.
Temerian Peasant 02|I did. Sea of corpses… and corpsers, feedin'. Someone told me they're afeared of fire, so I took a torch, tried to chase 'em off. Horseshite, I tell you. Would've ended up eaten alive if it weren't for Hussar here.
Temerian Peasant 02|Listen… guessin' you carry those swords for more than show. Come with me, keep the ghouls off. Help me find Bastien, and I'll pay you well.
Geralt|Looking for a woman. Raven-black hair, violet eyes? Came riding through from the direction of Willows.
Temerian Peasant 02|Lookin' for someone myself. My brother. Fought the Black Ones just outside the village. Big battle. Then… just disappeared.
Temerian Peasant 02|I've no desire for small talk. My brother… he's still missin'.
Temerian Peasant 02|Offer still stands. Help me find Bastien, and I'll throw you a few coins.
<|endoftext|>
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|But there is more. My lieutenant demanded we defecate on command. Ballista bolts landing all around, and all he could say was "A soldier with a full stomach will not step onto the battlefield. Now shit - that is an order." Can you believe it?! The cretin!
Temerian Guard 03|Stop hehe-- Ah! Yo-you're killing me. My-my ribs - haa, it hurts to laugh!
Geralt|That needs a tourniquet. But first… wanna explain what's going on here?
Temerian Guard 03|We… we fought in that battle. Huge it was, you heard? They had me killin' in Temeria's name, and Rhosyn in Nilfgaard's. Ordered to slay each other. We decided to run away.
Temerian Guard 03|Listen, I can't walk. And Rhosyn they'll hang for desertion if he happens on any of his own. Would you find my brother, tell 'im I'm alive? His name's Dune. He might have a dog with 'im - Hussar. Please… We'll die if he don't help us.
Geralt|See what I can do.
Geralt|Sorry. Got more urgent matters to tend to.
Temerian Peasant 02|Bastien! Is he… Has this Nilfgaardian captured you?
Temerian Guard 03|No. He saved my life. I got a cut to me side, and then got hit in the head. Couldn't see anything. Rhosyn here found me as… as he crawled across the battlefield. His leg's twisted. And so we were - a blind man leadin' a cripple. Found this place.
Temerian Peasant 02|I'm takin' you home. We need to see to these wounds.
Temerian Guard 03|I won't leave Rhosyn here. Alone, he'll die. And he can't go back to his own. He's deserted, they'll hang 'im.
Temerian Peasant 02|And what if they find him with us? They'll hang us all, my Liesje included! No, the Black 'un stays here!
Geralt|Your brother's right, Bastien. Nilfgaardians know no mercy. They live by their law. A law that's cruel as hell towards any who hide deserters, or aid them.
Temerian Guard 03|Rhosyn… I'll bring you food. And an herbalist. You'll see, in a week or two you--
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|Just go.
Temerian Peasant 02|Thank you, witcher. Your reward… and the gods protect ye.
Geralt|Bastien only made it with the Black One's help. Maybe you oughta show him Nordlings aren't as barbarous as Nilfgaardians make us out to be.
Temerian Peasant 02|Well… I could give him our pa's clothes, teach him to work the field. But… that accent. Fine, I'll take him in.
Temerian Guard 03|You're back! So… will you help us after all?
<|endoftext|>
Temerian Merchant 01|Oh! And? You find the box?
Geralt|Mhm. A little wet, but intact.
Temerian Merchant 01|At last, fortune smiles my way! Yours as well, witcher. Here, the gold I promised you. Happy trails, now.
Geralt|Yeah, found your priceless chest… and an arrow in poor Asher's side.
Geralt|No dryads in these swamps, and never known a drowner or a water hag to use a bow. So lacking any other suspects, I'm guessing--
Temerian Merchant 01|Watch out! Behind you!
Geralt|There's nothing behind me. I'm a witcher, I'd have heard it. Just like I can hear your heart. Which is pounding… like a liar's.
Geralt|Best hope you're a better rider than you are a liar.
Geralt|Yeah, found your priceless chest. And someone who looks an awful lot like a cart driver… with an arrow through his neck.
Geralt|Know what? Be right back.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Wake up. See, can't run from the truth… not even on horseback. Now, who are you? And why'd you attack that cart?
Temerian Merchant 01|Private First Class John Geermer. Temerian Sixth Division, Second Regiment. Disbanded, but still active - underground, in the woods.
Temerian Merchant 01|That was a medical transport. I'd be damned if it reached the Black Ones. And the medicine - our lads could use it, too. We've many ill among us. You let me go, and they might live… and fight once more for a free North.
Geralt|I'm taking you to the Nilfgaardians. You're a murderer, not a soldier.
Temerian Merchant 01|And you're a traitor. There's a scaffold out there with your name on it.
Geralt|Fine, go. And may you and your soldier buddies hiding in the bushes be victorious in your struggle against Nilfgaard.
Temerian Merchant 01|You've a vile sense of humor… but you're a decent man. Here, the gold I promised. Use it well - drink to the silver lilies and to Foltest's memory.
Geralt|You can go… but I'm keeping the medicine. Nilfgaard'll find you and kill you anyways. Why should it go to waste?
Temerian Merchant 01|Take it. And choke on it.
Geralt|Gotta get him outta here.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Hey, soldier! Waiting on a late transport, by any chance?
Nilfgaardian Soldier 03|What? Yes. Corporal Lyffned set out to command headquarters for medicine. He has yet to return, though he was due back several days ago.
Geralt|Medicine's here, in this box. And this… is a three-in-one - liar, thief and your corporal's murderer.
Temerian Merchant 01|Plough yourself, mutant.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 03|Captain Peter will see to him… And you, Nordling, deserve our thanks. The medication will not save our men's lives, but it will ease their dying.
Geralt|Gotta say I was kind of counting on a tangible token of gratitude. A golden, clinky one, in fact.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 03|I thought you acted from conviction, not greed. But if that is not the case, here. So you'll remember and tell others that Nilfgaard is generous with those who serve it willingly.
Geralt|Your soldiers falling sick? What with?
Nilfgaardian Soldier 03|I do not know. I do not ask. Those who take an interest are usually sent straight to the front.
<|endoftext|>
Temerian Peasant 02|Aye. 'Tis haunted. Has been for a good twenty years.
Geralt|Twenty? So why'd you put out a notice just now?
Temerian Peasant 02|Cause earlier on we drew our water from the river. But so many corpses floatin' in it after the battle, it's turned noxious. Me daughter Mandy drank half a pitcher, fell dreadful ill, can't keep nothing down… She grows worse by the day.
Temerian Peasant 02|Herbalist claims you fight a fever with drink. And not beer nor cider, but water - clear, pure water. And where'm I to get that if not from the well? But first the ghost's gotta be driven away. And it don't let any man near.
Geralt|This ghost - describe it for me.
Temerian Peasant 02|Well… it's awful frightening. Awful.
Geralt|I meant, what does it look like?
Temerian Peasant 02|It looks… like a woman, but fresh from the grave. Wears a dirty dress, all rags, its skin flaking off of its bones. And it howls… like it's sufferin'.
Geralt|Some wraith… or maybe an alp.
Temerian Peasant 02|If you don't wallop it, master… if you don't take care of it, that is, it'll come kill me daughter.
Geralt|Fine, I'll help. Where's this well?
Temerian Peasant 02|In Hovel, a settlement on the heights. It's abandoned now, no one ventures there on account of the ghost being about. Drive it off, please!
Geralt|I feel for you… but this is my job. So let's talk about my pay.
Temerian Peasant 02|Something not right with the coin?
Geralt|Sounds serious. Doubt I can get it done quickly. Come back when I have more time.
Temerian Peasant 02|So, master witcher? Will you see to the ghost? Me Mandy… she grows no better.
Geralt|Greetings, good man. Having trouble with your well? That's what I read.
Geralt|Greetings.
Temerian Peasant 02|A witcher! You see the notice? Here about the well?
Geralt|A well? First I've heard. There a problem?
Temerian Peasant 02|Ne'er in me life have I seen a sum approaching that.
Temerian Peasant 02|If you could drop your price a bit, I'm sure we'd agree.
Temerian Peasant 02|That settles it, then.
Temerian Peasant 02|Right honest jest, there, master witcher. Have you no shame to mock a poor man?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Job done. The well was haunted by the ghost of a woman who was killed there. I drove it away.
Temerian Peasant 02|I just hope every unburied wretch don't start hauntin' us, or that battle field's gonna cause us a heap o' trouble.
Geralt|If they do, you know who to contact. Meanwhile… Claer, Volker - names ring a bell?
Temerian Peasant 02|I don't know 'em. Though I did hear our herbalist Tomira mention a Claer once… Same one, maybe?
Geralt|How about that. Never expected to get a dowry.
Temerian Peasant 02|Nor did I suppose I'd ever give one to a witcher. Strange times, these, wouldn't you say? Strange and sad.
Geralt|At this point, doubt I'll ever marry… You keep the coin for Mandy, her wedding. Raise a toast to my health then.
Temerian Peasant 02|Thank you, master witcher. Them's warm words, you've a good heart. But I can't let you go empty-handed. Take this at least - for luck.
Geralt|Found a notice about an evil spirit haunting a well. You Odolan?
Temerian Peasant 02|Your reward, master. Thanks. Thank you so much.
Temerian Peasant 02|Your reward, master witcher. The gold I'd hid away for Mandy's dowry. Without you, she'd never 'ave lived to wed. Now… there's hope for it at least.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|A body? Can't reach it from here.
Geralt|The infamous well…
Geralt|Strange… she's not attacking.
Geralt|A bracelet. Examine it later.
Geralt|Strange, no sign of a ghost. Maybe it only shows at a certain time of day.
Geralt|Good place for a bonfire… except there's nothing here to burn.
Geralt|She fled… but she'll be back tomorrow. Something's keeping her here.
Geralt|Whoa - got too close.
Geralt|Noonwraith won't stray too far from the well.
Geralt|Noonwraith did this.
Geralt|Probably got too close to the well.
Geralt|Body's dried to a crisp. Signs of burns.
Geralt|A journal. Might be useful.
Geralt|All signs point to a noonwraith.
Geralt|Need to find out what happened here.
Geralt|Grass around the well's scorched.
Geralt|A noonwraith. Wonder what it's doing here.
Geralt|Blood stains, barely visible. Someone was dragged this way. Someone who was still alive.
Geralt|Blood stains, almost faded. But the line's taught. Something's not right.
Geralt|Something's tied the noonwraith to this place. An object… something she needs before she'll leave this world.
Geralt|Need to prepare for this fight. Brew some wraith oil, drink some potions.
Geralt|She's gone… for good.
Geralt|Journal I found in the abandoned hut… could be the key to this story.
Geralt|Hm, journal might deserve another look.
Geralt|That bracelet… might be what ties the woman's spirit to this place.
Geralt|A man… stabbed with a knife, died on the spot. Animals fed on his body, picked his skeleton clean.
Geralt|More blood stains over there. But it's not his blood.
<|endoftext|>
Verden Old Woman 03|It's always sat there empty, this hut. That is, till the night afore the battle. A man arrived, walked right in like 'twere his own. Was standin' at me window, peerin' at the goin's-on… He must've eyed me, 'cause next I knew, there he was, comin' my way!
Verden Old Woman 03|So, I grabbed me pan - for protection, see. But he just asks all polite, "Gran, got any birch bark, by chance? Lilac berries, or even a few coals?" Nay, says I! And you must be right daft to pester folk at night with such foolery!
Verden Old Woman 03|But I sees he ain't listenin'. Just starin' at me pan, like a magpie at a copper! "Lend it to me, gran, I'll give it back come morn." Was right baffled, for what's he doin' fryin' in the dark? But I've got a soft 'eart, so I gave it to 'im.
Geralt|Fascinating story. Any chance you're nearing the end?
Verden Old Woman 03|Afore dawn, another rode up to the hut. But come morn, only the first fellow left. Locked the door, hopped on his horse, and that were all I saw of him - and me pan! 'Twere old, black with soot, not worth much, I 'spose - but I've no other!
Verden Old Woman 03|Will you 'elp me, dearie? Bring an ol' widow her pan? I could never break down that door meself… And in truth I'm afeared to go in anyroad. Such a stench waftin' out. Methinks the other fellow… well, that he's lyin' there.
Geralt|Never taken on a pan contract… Fine, I'll go in, look around.
Geralt|You should wait here. Just in case.
Geralt|Sorry, got more important things to worry about. Yeah, even more important than your pan.
Geralt|Interesting. What happened then?
Verden Old Woman 03|So - what'll it be, dearie? Take pity on an old woman?!
Verden Old Woman 03|Oh, dearie! Since you're goin' in there, mind lookin' around for me fryin' pan? Rogue borrowed it from me, then left without returnin' it!
Geralt|What's that, again?
Geralt|Lost your key, ma'am?
Verden Old Woman 03|No, not me key. Me pan!
<|endoftext|>
Verden Old Woman 03|Mine…? But mine were black with soot! And I could see meself in this 'un if I wanted. But them years're past…
Geralt|Soot's just what the gentleman needed. He scraped it off and made ink out of it.
Verden Old Woman 03|And… and the other fellow?
Geralt|Dead. Round up a few boys and bury him outside the village. Deep, so the necrophages don't dig him up. And take my advice… don't mention this to the Nilfgaardians.
Verden Old Woman 03|Hang about! You've earned a token o' thanks. Here, sonny - for the road.
Geralt|Strangled… by an expert. Round up some men and bury him outside the village. Deep, so the corpse eaters don't get at him. And take my advice… don't mention any of this to the Nilfgaardians.
Geralt|It was the soot the man needed. He scraped it off to make ink. Must've had an urgent letter to write. Urgently burned some other documents, too.
Geralt|Decided to help you anyway. Here - your frying pan.
Geralt|Here - your frying pan.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What happened here?
Dwarf Man 02|Oh, got a wee bit chilly the night, so I set fire to my forge. Got it nice and roarin'! Roasted some wieners!
Dwarf Man 02|Whaddaya think happened, dimwit? Some bugger set alight me… me workshop! I've lost everythin'. Everythin'!
Geralt|Easy on the insults. I could add to your misfortune.
Geralt|Any suspects?
Dwarf Man 02|Whole damned village. I've lived here half a century. Thought they saw me as one o' their own. But everythin' changed when the Black Ones came. I'm the only smith around, so I got to service their garrison. Bang dents out o' plate, shoe horses - that sorta thing.
Dwarf Man 02|Nilfgaardians don't pay me a bloody copper, just give me supplies and orders. But humans can't fathom that. They think I'm gettin' rich off their misfortune, that I sleep on a pile o' gold like a ploughin' dragon. They've stopped talkin' to me, spit when I pass… and now this.
Geralt|I can find your arsonist. Provided you're willing to pay.
Dwarf Man 02|Huh, I've not much left… but I'll give ye all if ye bring me that whoreson. So that he gets what he deserves.
Dwarf Man 02|The night o' the fire, I heard movement outside my hut. Went out to see if could find any tracks, but found nothin'. But then I haven't got cat eyes, have I? Good luck.
Geralt|Good luck rebuilding. Farewell.
Geralt|Sorry.
Dwarf Man 02|Eh? Whaddaya want?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Shavings from a tinderbox. Arsonist must've lit his torch here, tossed it on the roof… then fled through the orchard.
Geralt|Boot prints… A man's. Large.
Geralt|Took off his boots and went in the water. Probably wanted to cover his trail.
Geralt|Something jumped out of the rushes. Drowners. But he managed to escape.
Geralt|Lost his boots in the rush.
Geralt|Tracks lead back to the village.
Geralt|Bleeding… but not badly. Surface wound.
Geralt|Drowner claw marks. It's gotta be him.
Geralt|Trail ends here… but I'll recognize him by his wounds.
Geralt|Stinks of piss… and vodka.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Nasty wound. Run into a drowner?
Temerian Peasant 03|What the fuck do you care?!
Geralt|Whoa. Our arsonist's a charmer, too. Come on. Smith wants to talk to you.
Temerian Peasant 03|I'll not talk to a nonhuman - sons o' bitches, all. And dwarves're the worst! Greedy little magpies - do anything for gold, they will! Heh, they forge the blades the Black Ones put to our throats! Am I not right?
Temerian Peasant 03|Listen, we can work this out man to man. I give you gold, you don't turn me in. My mum died a while back and I sold her tools. I've spent some… but what's left is yours.
Geralt|Magpies and dwarves might be greedy, but I'm not. Can't buy me.
Temerian Peasant 03|Then I'll beat your fuckin' mug to a pulp!
Geralt|Try me, peasant. I could use the practice.
Geralt|Calm down. Now follow me.
Geralt|Fine, I'll agree to that… if you swear to stop playing with fire. Fail to do that and I'll come back, and someone'll get hurt.
Temerian Peasant 03|Of course, master witcher! I swear on me dead mum! Your gold… and here's to your health! Down with the Black Ones and nonhumans alike!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Here you go - one village pyromaniac in the flesh.
Dwarf Man 02|Napp? You?! I knew your mum for years, charged her nary a copper! This is how you repay me?! I've had enough. Oi, soldier! A minute of your time, please!
Temerian Peasant 03|No! Willis - I beg you! I-I-I was drunk… di-didn't know what I was doin'!
Nilfgaardian Soldier 02|I've told you, Master Willis. We will help you rebuild once reinforcements come. The supplies have been ordered.
Dwarf Man 02|Not what this is about, mate. This here's the arsonist. The witcher found him!
Nilfgaardian Soldier 02|The forge was important to the garrison. Destroying it was sabotage. No trial needed here. Just a tree.
Geralt|Villagers'll really love you, now.
Dwarf Man 02|Well, now I don't give a flyin' fuck about them.
Dwarf Man 02|You know, I hated the Black Ones at first, like everybody else did. Now I'm thinkin' they might just bring order to this place - teach these layabouts some manners! But enough about that. Your reward.
Dwarf Man 02|And… I managed to save some things from the fire. Anvil's still whole, so I'm sure I can bang somethin' out on it. You need anythin', let me know. Give you a good price.
Geralt|Harsh as punishment goes…
Dwarf Man 02|But deserved.
Geralt|Up and at 'em!
Temerian Peasant 03|Hm? What… wha-what's goin' on?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Aeramas' residence, must be. Let's see what's inside.
Geralt|Phew, reeks in here…
Geralt|That stench - ripe cheese. Seems Aeramas was a tyromancer.
Geralt|My Trial of the Cheeses… Vesemir'll get a kick out this when I tell him.
Geralt|Not sure this can get any worse…
Geralt|What'd he make this cheese out of? Nekker milk?!
Geralt|Need to be careful.
Geralt|House is completely destroyed, but the magic circle's intact.
Geralt|Guessing this is a locked portal. Need to find the key.
Geralt|Looks to me like a locked portal.
Geralt|Wonder if I can open it using one of Aeramas' items…
Geralt|Damage looks fresh. Wonder what happened?
Geralt|Some kind of vault. I should look around.
Geralt|Magic barrier's still active. Gotta find a way to turn it off.
Geralt|Gotta share this discovery with Lambert - foglets are immune to the smell of old cheese.
Geralt|If this sword is as deadly as Aeramas' cheeses, it's worth taking.
Geralt|Maybe I'll name it "The Emmentaler."
Geralt|Deactivated the barrier.
Geralt|Fresh air. Finally.
<|endoftext|>
Verden Peasant 03|They'd 'ave eaten me alive for certain. Corpses must've drawn 'em. Thank ye for not leavin' me there. Seems luck's with me atimes after all.
Geralt|Luck? Guess things could be worse. You get infected recently? That why you haul corpses?
Verden Peasant 03|Wha? No - it's me job. Well paid, too.
Geralt|Hm. Thing is, you're not a witcher or a mage, so you're not immune…
Verden Peasant 03|I'm no foul mutant, thank the gods, but no worries, nay! It's just, well, no illness ever holds me.
Geralt|Gonna need a new cart - gotta burn this one. Soon.
Verden Peasant 03|Can't I just bury the stiffs somewheres near? Cart's still fit for fixin'…
Geralt|Anyone learns you carried plague victims in it, no one'll ever hire you again.
Verden Peasant 03|Why would they need to learn? I won't tell if you don't…
Geralt|… and you'll spread the pox for miles around.
Geralt|Need to figure out the cart yourself. I gotta go.
Verden Peasant 03|You've helped me greatly all the same! Thanks again, and godspeed!
Verden Peasant 03|Now to find that daft horse, then get the stiffs back on the wagon.
Geralt|How'd this happen?
Verden Peasant 03|Axle snapped first. So, I poked me head underneath, see if I could fix it. Then outta the blue… a howl from the woods.
Verden Peasant 03|My mare reared as if a wolf had already clinched her hind. The cart tipped and - whoa! The cargo fell right on top me.
Geralt|Your horse run off?
Verden Peasant 03|Aye, damn thing bolted. Ain't that my luck? If it don't rain, a wagon o' stiffs pours on me head.
Geralt|Mentioned some pox from the Black Ones?
Verden Peasant 03|Aye! Uh, well, they brought an illness to Velen. Treat their own, they do, while our folk drop like flies. Pfoo! Ooh - whoa! Argh, ooh I just got a waft, oh the stench!
Geralt|Who blames the Nilfgaardians? Who says it's their plague?
Verden Peasant 03|Ealdorman of Lindenvale. 'Twere him paid me to bury these corpses - in a ditch, he says, far from the village as possible. He don't want folk panickin'.
Verden Peasant 03|Not the dumbest man, no… uhh, a folk activist or somesuch.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|You sure?
Verden Peasant 03|I beg ye... Do it quick.
Verden Peasant 03|Then burn my remains.
Geralt|All right.
Verden Peasant 03|Thank ye. Take this. Thought I'd leave some coin for me young 'uns… but they've no need of it now.
Geralt|Sorry. Can't do that.
Verden Peasant 03|I beg ye…
Geralt|No.
Verden Peasant 03|No? Why the hell not? You disgusted? Afeared of your conscience? Gods dammit, do it quick - I'll pay ye.
Verden Peasant 03|If you won't… get out o' my sight. Let me die in peace.
Geralt|Looking for ghouls? Why?
Verden Peasant 03|No one else to do me in. Been in a bad way for days, final breaths, like… but somehow can't die. So strong since I were a lad, dammit…
Geralt|Hmm… We met before?
Verden Peasant 03|Aye. You pulled me from under a pile o' stiffs. I was sure the scourge'd never touch me. So sure, so foolish…
Verden Peasant 03|Listen. You did me a kindness once, do me another. Got a sharp sword there. Finish this.

Borys The Troll|Ahh, to you. Man kindnice. Gift.
Borys The Troll|Kindnice man, troll help. Take. Award.
Geralt|This is the head of an elf!
Borys The Troll|Elfies good. Like tometooo.
Borys The Troll|Aaah! Aa-haha. Final quiet, ha. Good time man comes, haha. Greeny near bubblegone.
Geralt|Watcha got in the pot?
Borys The Troll|Zoup-ala-corpse, troll's old formily. Much goods, haha. Slinks, froggies, bonehelms… joysmell sticks!
Borys The Troll|Last - one nekkro. For flavorful.
Geralt|Put anything else in the soup? No humans, I hope.
Borys The Troll|Mans? Noo… Mans some gibber interesting. Mans no gibber, go in pot.
Geralt|You like talking to humans?
Borys The Troll|Yah! Nekkras, ghoulwas - done dull. No gibber at all!
Geralt|Actually talked to a ghoul once. Found him quite eloquent.
Borys The Troll|Gibbering ghoul? Nooo. That like… like cucumbra singing… or somethis.
Geralt|Putting nekkers in your soup? Is that why they got mad?
Borys The Troll|Nekkro one! Two no soup taste good. Nekkras others come, but my no call them.
Geralt|Well, you put one of their brothers in the pot. It's natural they'd be a bit… upset.
Borys The Troll|Oh, they zoup want in too? Jealous is?
Geralt|No, it's more like…
Borys The Troll|Many gots now. Many much for zoup. Zdew, maybe? Nekkras good as rotting. More saucy. Heh!

Temerian Peasant 01|Help some fellers out, master? We're a bit o' coin short another round.
Temerian Peasant 02|Cause we're comrades, see? Witcher, ain't you? We're butchers! You slaughter, we slaughter!
Temerian Peasant 01|Cept witchers earn more. Whole villages pitch in, lords open their purses, ladies do like with their legs!
Geralt|Guess I been to the wrong villages, dealt with the wrong lords and ladies.
Temerian Peasant 01|C'mon, don't make us beg! What's a witcher for, anyways? You're to help men in need.
Geralt|Fine, take this.
Temerian Peasant 01|That's what I call loyalty to the guild! Thank you, master! We'll knock one back in your honor!
Geralt|You boys look tired. Probably oughta go home now.
Temerian Peasant 01|Well… How long we been drinkin' now?
Temerian Peasant 02|Two days. Well said, master. Ahome we will go.
Geralt|Believe me, doing you a big favor by not giving you coin. Now lemme through.
Temerian Peasant 01|Whoa! Master! You'd best watch your words! We share a trade, but that don't mean you can treat us like dogs!
Temerian Peasant 02|Sh-shut it! You'll bring misfortune on us. He's a witcher, can't you see?
Geralt|Calm down, don't want any trouble. Here, drink yourselves dumb.
Geralt|Outta my way.
Temerian Peasant 01|We won't do it!
Temerian Peasant 02|I will…
Temerian Peasant 01|I'll not take orders from anyone! In fact, not the least afeared to teach a witcher some manners!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What's the matter? A monster bothering you?
Verden Old Woman 02|Naye. A ghost.
Geralt|Can you tell me anything more?
Verden Old Woman 02|You see, Jackamar haunts me dreams… Jackamar's me husband, or was till he died at war.
Verden Old Woman 02|He stands by me headboard and wails: "So many years apart, I've such woe in the beyond, come join me."
Verden Old Woman 02|I say, "I'll come, Jackamar, but when the gods summon me, not before." Then he says, "Leave your weddin' ring by me grave, it'll make the waitin' lighter." And I'd leave it… were the woods not so terryfin'.
Verden Old Woman 02|So I thought to meself… Maybe you…?
Geralt|Be glad to help. Where's Jackamar buried?
Verden Old Woman 02|A little cemetery near Blackbough… In a grave 'neath the old tree.
Verden Old Woman 02|Here, take me ring. Once you've laid it down, come to me for your reward. I live in a hut in the middle of the village with my granddaughter, Lessy.
Geralt|Sorry… Ghosts aren't my specialty.
Verden Old Woman 02|That much is obvious…
Geralt|What?
Verden Old Woman 02|Nothin', nothin'. The gods guide ye.
Geralt|Sure it's your husband's ghost?
Verden Old Woman 02|Ye sayin' I can't tell me own man? I'm old, but ain't gone daft yet!
Geralt|Not what I meant. There's wraiths that deceive, assume the form of dead loved ones. Trows, for instance, or dunnies…
Verden Old Woman 02|Naye, I'm sure this is Jackamar. In me dreams he spoke of our nuptuals, how we danced at Belleteyn, how the Redanians killed him at Rinde…
Geralt|Rinde? You've either mixed something up, or you're very old indeed. Battle happened eighty years ago.
Verden Old Woman 02|Oh, aye, slip o' the tongue. Meant to say the Battle of Rivia.
<|endoftext|>
Verden Woman 04|Witcher… What brings ye?
Geralt|Lessy, right? Wanted to talk to your grandma.
Verden Woman 04|To my… But she's been dead for years!
Geralt|Guess I talked to a ghost…
Geralt|Why wasn't she buried alongside her husband?
Verden Woman 04|I can't say for certain, I was a little lass then. But me mum told me that shortly 'fore gran died she learned granddad had kept lovers on the side. She had no desire to lie beside him.
Geralt|Seems she changed her mind. She wanted something to connect her and her husband in the afterlife… asked me for help.
Verden Woman 04|Hard to believe… But you've an honest look about ye.
Verden Woman 04|If you helped gran, you deserve a reward. Here. 'Tain't much, but I'm afeared it'll have to do.
Geralt|Just passing through. So long.

Novigrad Trader 01|Damned cheap guards - you get your coin's worth! Even less! Thank you, witcher! Where would I be without you?
Geralt|Your guards run off?
Novigrad Trader 01|Louts didn't get the chance, thank the gods. It's them you cut down. Waited until we had passed the last settlements, then attacked!
Novigrad Trader 01|And to think I made sure the scoundrels were well-armed! We stood no chance against them!
Geralt|Hiring thugs - not a good idea these days. Need someone you can trust to guard a caravan.
Novigrad Trader 01|I cannot afford to enlist anyone permanently.
Geralt|Where'd you find these men?
Novigrad Trader 01|Former Temerian soldiers, they claimed to be. Of all people, I thought they'd know the trade.
Geralt|Knew it all too well, in a way…
Novigrad Trader 01|Thank you. Please, this was to be theirs at our destination. Now it's yours.
Geralt|Why'd you come all the way to Velen? Not many to sell to around here.
Novigrad Trader 01|There's the baron. Perhaps you've heard of him?
Geralt|Worth the journey just to sell to him?
Novigrad Trader 01|We'd never've set course for these gods-forsaken lands if it wasn't.
Novigrad Trader 01|And we've not much competition - that's the upside.
Geralt|Probably decided you weren't paying them enough…
Novigrad Trader 01|Nonsense. I paid them more than they were worth. A rumor went about that ghouls and other such monstrosities prowled the roads…
Novigrad Trader 01|They demanded more, as no one else dared ride this way.
Geralt|Think these boys could've handled some monsters?
Novigrad Trader 01|They fell to a solitary witcher… so I truly doubt it.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|You the ones destroying shrines all over Velen?
Novigrad Rich Man 01|What's that got to do with you?
Geralt|What's it got to do with you?
Novigrad Rich Man 01|We are the heralds of lightning, heavy drops from leaden clouds! Unleashed, the lightning's name shall be Overman!
Geralt|The locals claim the gods are unhappy. No fear of their wrath?
Novigrad Rich Man 01|The wrath of the gods? The gods are dead! We but dispose of their rotting remains - the dying embers of superstition that harms.
Geralt|Great. Need a favor, though - you gotta clean up after yourselves here. Then go back to wherever you came from - dispose of those embers there.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Religion is the opiate of the masses! The gods are dead! Thus speaks Master Friedrich of Oxenfurt!
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Common folk fear religion and the priests, not the gods. And this fear enslaves us in fetters of ignorance! We must forge a new morality - or rid ourselves of morality altogether.
Geralt|You'll do what you want. But if I were you, I'd get out of here. On account of the ghouls.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|And you beware. For he who long fights monsters turns monster himself. And the, uh… abyss gazes into him, also.
Geralt|Sheesh. Students…
Geralt|Amusing as this little show is, I'm getting bored. Leave and don't come back.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Or what?!
Geralt|Or I'll tell on you to the headmistress.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Repression! Attack the system's lackey!
Geralt|Stop this. End it.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|We shall not heed a stooge who goes about on the clergy's leash.
<|endoftext|>
Verden Peasant 04|Thank ye, thank ye! Ye came just in time! A moment more and that ghoul would've filleted me like a flounder!
Geralt|Actually, not sure I should've intervened. Your combat style - it's new to me. Shoulda just observed.
Geralt|Where'd you complete your training? School of the Snail? But then where'd you get your wolf's head medallion…?
Verden Peasant 04|You're… You're the real thing, a witcher!
Geralt|Mhm. What gave it away? That I didn't wet my trousers at the sight of one lousy ghoul? Answer the question: where'd you get the medallion?
Verden Peasant 04|I bought it… from a travelin' peddler. Oh, villagers a-comin'! Don't tell 'em about me, please!
Verden Peasant 01|Monster's slain! Oy, what's this? Two witchers? We only hired one.
Geralt|Monster was fierce - took two witchers to take it down.
Verden Peasant 01|That's 'tween you two. This 'un didn't want coin, so you've none to quarrel over.
Geralt|Of course. So this witcher demanded the traditional reward. One other hallowed witchers' principle you should be aware of, then.
Verden Peasant 02|Yeah? What's that?
Geralt|Any witcher needing a brother's aid must then bury his medallion in the earth. In doing so, he renounces his trade. Then he's gotta work for the village elder for a year.
Geralt|You can take him there now.
Verden Peasant 01|Oooh… A witcher's surely worth two ordinary laborers.
Geralt|At least two. Farewell.
Geralt|Any witcher calling on a brother to aid him can never return to the site of their struggle together.
Verden Peasant 01|Not surprisin', given the shame he carries.
Verden Peasant 01|Come on, Mulik. Villagers should know the ghoul's been killed dead.
Verden Peasant 02|Farewell.
Verden Peasant 04|And thank you.
Geralt|Get outta my sight.
Geralt|Only one witcher here. This man's a charlatan - travels from village to village, cheating people.
Verden Peasant 04|No, no, it's not like that - I can explain everythin', I can!
Verden Peasant 01|He's a crook, a fraud! Oh, we've laws for this kind, special punishments. Thank ye for exposin' him, master witcher.
Geralt|Let him go - this time.
Verden Peasant 04|I… I… never again… I swear…
Verden Peasant 02|He's a halfwit, ain't he? Goin' after a ghoul…
Verden Peasant 01|Things'd be simple if the ghoul'd torn 'im apart. As it is, we've got ourselves a moral dilemma.
Verden Peasant 02|Let 'im go. But don't ye come near our village. We'll set the hounds on you if you do, is that clear?
Verden Peasant 02|Yeah?
Verden Peasant 04|Thank ye.
Geralt|Get outta my sight.
Geralt|Oughta take him to the village elder.
Verden Peasant 02|Course. Elder can decide what to do with the scoundrel.
Verden Peasant 02|Last cheat came through, fellow payin' with shaved coins - we lopped his hands off.
Geralt|I'm sure your elder takes care to make the punishment suit the crime.
Geralt|Oughta start by taking his sword, tossing his medallion in the fire. Farewell.
Verden Peasant 04|Hide! Monsters out there!
<|endoftext|>
Verden Old Man 01|Ye deaf?! Begone, ye blasted mutant!
Geralt|Where's all this hate for witchers coming from?
Verden Old Man 01|Where? I'll tell ye where! One o' yous came here, ate his fill for two days while he thunked things over. Then he says he'd do us a favor and kill our monster.
Verden Old Man 01|What's your price, I asked, but he said he wanted no coin, for he saw we'd none to offer.
Geralt|Awfully noble of him.
Verden Old Man 01|Thought so too, at first.
Verden Old Man 01|Said for pay he'd take somethin' I had but did not yet know about. Then he left. And 'ere the door swung shut behind 'im, me lass started wailin'. "What's these tears?" I asked. "Oh, I can't bear it," she says, "I'll kill the whoreson!"
Geralt|Go on.
Verden Old Man 01|Fool girl wept that some beast was gonna kill the witcher dead. "Ye howlin' for a mutant?" I said. Then she tol' me, tol' me: bugger had bewitched her with his evil eye, seduced her! And that were to be his prize: a witcher's bastard!
Geralt|If he's really a witcher, you don't have a thing to worry about. We can't sire children.
Verden Old Man 01|Thank the gods - any more of yous and we'd be lost! But this one, he beguiled me daughter, rutted her 'neath me own roof - that I can't forgive!
Geralt|Tell me where he is. Take care of this for you.
Verden Old Man 01|Cemetery - went there to slay the monster. Hope the corpse eater guts that fornicatin' freak!
Geralt|So what did he want instead of coin?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Steal much?
Temerian Bandit 01|See any monsters? Eh? Sod off, witcher, we've no need for you!
Geralt|Actually, I see a few monsters…
Temerian Peasant 03|Where?!
Verden Scavenger 03|Dremmy, dammit, dumber than a hunk o' lard you are! He means us!
Verden Scavenger 02|We're common folk. You're the mutant, the poxy freak! Get 'im, lads!
Geralt|No. No monsters. But before I go - as I see it, you should all get an equal share of the loot.
Temerian Bandit 01|Hear that? You're lookin' to make arses of us! A blind man could see it!
Temerian Peasant 03|Enough of the chatter! I'm takin' the beads! And the bronze ring!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What're you doing?
Temerian Peasant 03|What one does in the country… Harvestin'. Just switched from wheat fields to battlefields.
Geralt|Corpses look fresh. Some of these men - still alive a bit ago, right?
Temerian Peasant 03|Aye, they were. Wounded but breathin'. Healer could've helped 'em… But no healers around. Just us.
Geralt|Yeah. Just thieves… and murderers.
Temerian Peasant 03|You're ploughin' startin' to annoy me. And I don't like bein' annoyed.
Geralt|Listen, I…
Geralt|Behind you!
Verden Scavenger 03|If you think I'm gonna fall for… Oh, you fucker!
Geralt|Calm down. I'm going.
Verden Scavenger 03|Good idea. Go.
Verden Scavenger 03|Not another step… Or there'll be one corpse more.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What'd this man do to you?
Temerian Peasant 03|Him? Nothin'. Appeared in the village… Lookin' to trade his ring for some bread.
Temerian Bandit 01|But we've no food, none. 'Cause of the Black Ones - trampled our fields, raided our granaries, burned our orchards. So instead of bread, he'll get a noose.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|Please, good folk. Do you not have ears?! I did not want this war! I have deserted, to go home to my wife and child! Take everything I have, but spare my life!
Geralt|Let him go.
Temerian Peasant 03|Oh, sure, and maybe give 'im some fixin's for the journey? Saddle up a horse for 'im?
Temerian Bandit 01|Black Ones showed us no mercy. We show them none in return.
Geralt|Tried it the nice way… Gotta try something different.
Geralt|Do what you want.
Temerian Peasant 03|Oh, we will… Don't you fret.
Geralt|Still torturing him?
Temerian Peasant 03|No worries, he'll hang soon.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Take them in, give 'em a home. Won't steal from you, then.
Novigrad Old Woman 03|Sure, but I'll be feedin' the whelps! I gain nothin' from it.
Novigrad Old Woman 03|But… Suppose I'll give it some thought.
Geralt|Keep watch - kids are likely to try again.
Novigrad Old Woman 03|Oh, I'll be waitin' for 'em! With a stout branch to smack the little shits with!
Geralt|Easy, they're just kids.
Novigrad Old Woman 03|Aye, for now. But they'll grow into bandits, you wait!
Geralt|Found a group of kids in the woods. They were the ones stealing your hens.
Novigrad Old Woman 03|Oh, children, eh? Ridin' on the backs of wolves, were they?
Geralt|Never any wolves here. The kids are just… clever…
Novigrad Old Woman 03|If they've anythin' in their noggins, they'll stay away from me hen house now!
Geralt|I can help you. Not for free… But, you're advanced in years, so I won't ask too much.
Novigrad Old Woman 03|Poppycock. "Not much," he says, but you'll take me liver come the end. Well, no one else's linin' up to help me…
Novigrad Old Woman 03|Me hens started disappearin' about a week past. Always take one at a time, the vermin.
Geralt|One at a time? Interesting… Monsters leave any tracks?
Novigrad Old Woman 03|Aye, prints of wolf paws, but… strange-like, as if the wolves walked on their hind legs.
Novigrad Old Woman 03|And don't you be like that wise-arse Yosip from Downwarren. Tells me I'm mistaken. But few know beast tracks like I do - me man were the best poacher for miles around.
Geralt|I see. I'd still like to examine the prints myself.
Geralt|What happened, ma'am?
Novigrad Old Woman 03|As if the war weren't enough, sir. I'm losin' me hens! How'm I to live? Eh?
Geralt|Get a look at the thieves?
Novigrad Old Woman 03|What thieves?! It's monsters takin' me chickens.
Novigrad Old Woman 03|An ordinary thief I'd nab on me own, but beasts? What'm I to do?
Geralt|Take care, now.
Novigrad Old Woman 03|Eh, witcher? What is it?
<|endoftext|>
Verden Girl 01|Watch out, Petey! He's got a sword!
Verden Boy 02|A soldier!
Verden Boy 01|He won't take us alive!
Geralt|Not gonna hurt you.
Verden Boy 01|Then why're you here? That captain with the black mustache send you?
Geralt|Don't know any captain. Followed the tracks of the hen-stealing monsters here.
Verden Girl 01|Pff, you're a lot of fuss over a few skinny hens.
Verden Girl 01|The old lady didn't like 'em much anyway. She were always yellin' at 'em. And she looks like a witch.
Geralt|Why're you in the woods? Where are your parents?
Verden Boy 02|Soldiers caught 'em.
Verden Boy 01|We was crossin' the river, but they spotted us. We ran, but mum and dad had bags. Told us to flee.
Geralt|Lived in the woods alone ever since?
Verden Boy 01|Sure. Find a lot of things, steal a few others… we get by just fine.
Geralt|You survive by stealing from others. This can't end well. You should ask someone for help.
Verden Boy 01|Who'd help us? Who'd take us?
Verden Boy 01|Once we've got all the hens, we'll go deep in the woods!
Verden Girl 01|Petey says we's gonna hunt, wear animal hides, sew a tent outta leaves…
Verden Boy 01|And never grow up!
Geralt|Hmm. Last bit's most likely.
Geralt|Good luck, I guess. And watch out for yourselves.
Geralt|Where'd the wolf prints come from?
Verden Boy 02|Da once hunted down a wolf, gave each of us a paw for good luck. We tied 'em to our shoes.
Verden Boy 01|Cause wolves steal hens, right?
Geralt|Sure, usually not one at a time, though.
Geralt|Time I was on my way.
Verden Girl 01|You'll not tell anyone we's here?
Geralt|I won't, but you be careful.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|If it ain't that fuckin' priest, it's corpse eaters… I'm done with this damned town.
Geralt|A priest?
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|We'd agreed to meet as usual, just a larger delivery… "Good customer," I thought… Then they whipped out blades!
Geralt|We still talking about a priest of the Eternal Fire?
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|I'd say so! Beet-stained pricks can't be trusted! This one'd ordered premium grade fisstech from me three times, everythin' perfect…
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|But the fourth his men came at us with knives. Sought to knock us outta the trade.
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Shoved me in that ditch with the corpses, must've thought the ghouls would take care o' the rest.
Geralt|And to make sure, he hired a witcher to burn the bodies, destroy any evidence.
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|A witcher?! Meanin' you?! So what now?
Geralt|Nothing. Didn't pay me to burn the living.
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Ah, thank the gods it's true what they say: though mutants, you live by a code! Oh, thank you, witcher!
Geralt|Bullshit.
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Right. Got things backwards on account o' the drama. Thanks for helpin' me.
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Fuck, saw a ghoul take a corpse's leg! Whole damn leg, in one swipe!
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Gotta go somewhere else. Even if it's ploughin' Poviss.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What do you want?
Eternal Fire Priest 01|Rejoice, for even a creature as depraved and base in nature as you can serve the glory of the Eternal Fire.
Eternal Fire Priest 01|Someone must see to the corpses on the battlefield. Necrophages defile those not already rotting in mass graves. This is not right.
Geralt|That's to be my good deed for the day?
Eternal Fire Priest 01|A handsomely profitable one, I might add. I know your kind don't work for free.
Geralt|All right. I'll take care of it.
Eternal Fire Priest 01|This will count amongst your merits. The more good one works in life, the more… hallowed things are. Yes. Splendid. Here are the holy oils.
Eternal Fire Priest 01|Douse generously and set alight, understood? I wish it to flare up to the sky. For the glory of the Eternal Fire and all that.
Geralt|Once I've incinerated the bodies, where'll I find you?
Eternal Fire Priest 01|I shall be near the bridge to Novigrad.
Geralt|Not interested. Farewell.
Eternal Fire Priest 01|Well, witcher? Have you completed your task?
Geralt|Tended to the corpses in the mass graves. Incinerated 'em all.
Eternal Fire Priest 01|Hm, have you any proof?
Geralt|Proof? Whaddaya want, a fistful of ashes? If you don't believe me, take a stroll across the battlefield, see for yourself.
Geralt|You're a man of the cloth - ghouls and graveirs shouldn't bother you.
Eternal Fire Priest 01|My , my, irritable, aren't we. No reason. You must practice the virtue of patience, my son. Take this and go in peace.
Geralt|So, took care of the graves. Interesting, actually. One of the corpses proved to be quite, well, alive. And pretty talkative.
Eternal Fire Priest 01|What do you mean?
Geralt|Fisstech dealer, one of 'em survived. Had an awfully interesting story to tell.
Eternal Fire Priest 01|Hmmm… Intriguing. I would purchase this story from you. For all time. Exclusively.
Geralt|Deal.
Eternal Fire Priest 01|Take this and get out of my sight.
Geralt|You can hire me. But you sure as hell can't buy me.
Eternal Fire Priest 01|Ah, an impasse. Well then, it will be cheapest to kill you.
Eternal Fire Priest 01|Three on one. Surely we'll manage - witcher or not! Take him!
Geralt|Why'd you priests take an interest in the fallen so late?
Eternal Fire Priest 01|The Church of the Eternal Fire's first duty is to the living. You've no notion of the work we did just after the battle.
Eternal Fire Priest 01|The wounded needed tending, refugees - pastoral care. We had sermons to deliver, donations to collect…
Geralt|Relieved to hear it. What would the people've done without you?
Geralt|Farewell.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What's the matter?
Novigrad Peasant 03|Woodland spook done took me mare the other night. And there I were, so content the war had spared her…
Geralt|A woodland spook?
Novigrad Peasant 03|Aye. As me forefathers told it, comes at midnight, sprinkles blood on your threshold so as none'll wake - and then it steals.
Novigrad Peasant 03|Er… Would you search out me mare for me? Chat with the wood-dweller, perchance he'll give her back?
Geralt|How much'll you give me if I find your horse?
Novigrad Peasant 03|Give ye… a fifth o' vodka. Sound all right?
Geralt|It'd sound fine if you changed that fifth to five, then added jugs at the end, then offered me the equivalent in crowns.
Novigrad Peasant 03|Well… fine. Have it your way. Just bring her back. She's a gray mare, mind ye. None too large.
Geralt|Even spooks leave tracks. Lemme look around, see if I can't find some.
Geralt|Not the kinda job I do.
Novigrad Peasant 03|Why ain't it? You're a witcher, 'tis plain. And I won't go into the woods meself.
Geralt|Why not? No woodland spooks in there, that's certain. Farewell.
Novigrad Peasant 03|What if I paid ye?
Geralt|No.
Novigrad Peasant 03|Hm, hm. Strange, that 'un.
Geralt|Horses disappear around here often?
Novigrad Peasant 03|Nay, sir. Not many horses at all these days. Soldiers took all that didn't die. But me neighbor had a steed, then two nights past - whoosh!
Novigrad Peasant 03|Spook took 'im. Times past, 'twere maybe a cow gettin' milked at night or a hen nipped here or there, but now-- Ahhhh…
Geralt|Interesting.
Geralt|Think I know what happened. It was no woodland spook. Your horse is in a Scoia'tael camp.
Novigrad Peasant 03|Me mare's gone and joined the Squirrels? She were peaceful always, and now she's a rebel?!
Novigrad Peasant 03|Argh…
<|endoftext|>
Scoiatael Man 01|No closer. Nothing here for you, vatt'ghern.
Geralt|Gotta take one of the horses back to its owner.
Scoiatael Man 01|You sound certain, but should you be? What now? Will you kill what remains of our unit for one old nag?
Geralt|No, I'll pay you for the horse. Don't care about the rest.
Scoiatael Man 01|Hm, this horse - why is it so important to you?
Geralt|Just trying to keep my word. Made a deal with its owner, that's all.
Scoiatael Man 01|If so, take it. But I don't wish to see you here again.
Geralt|You'll give it to me… willingly.
Scoiatael Man 01|Take one horse - that I'll allow.
Geralt|If I have to…
Geralt|Know the owner of one… but you probably need his horse more than he does.
Scoiatael Man 01|Did you mean to take it? What next? Might we expect villagers with torches and pitchforks?
Geralt|Doubt they'll venture out this far. Farewell.
Geralt|Need that many horses? Your light brigade planning to charge straight into Radovid's camp?
Scoiatael Man 01|We need them to transport the wounded.
Geralt|Uh-huh. Local peasants must've charged you a bundle for them.
Scoiatael Man 01|If we could afford to purchase horses, we would not be starving.
Geralt|So long.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Peasant 03|What say you, sir?
Geralt|Couldn't find your mare. Must really be a woodland spook running around.
Novigrad Peasant 03|Is there now't we can do?
Geralt|No. And in general, don't venture too deep into the woods. You never know what a spook'll do.
Geralt|This your mare?
Novigrad Peasant 03|Nay, not at all! She were gray, I told ye. And twice as old, legs as crooked as me dead wife's.
Novigrad Peasant 03|Suppose I got to pay you more for this young 'un. But, oh well.
Geralt|Thanks. So long.
Novigrad Peasant 03|Aye, I'd recognize her anywhere.
Novigrad Peasant 03|C'mon, Jumper, you've got some explaining to do. Where'd ye wonder off to, anyway?
Novigrad Peasant 03|And here's yours, sir, as agreed.
Geralt|Thanks. So long.
Geralt|Farewell.

Geralt|Fine. I'll try to find some paint for you.
Troll_1|Good mans. Redaniarmy no service forget.

Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Interest you in a pass? Cheapest around, right here.
Geralt|What? Could dress up like Radovid and buy a gilded carriage for that much.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|What'm I to do if you can't afford it?
Geralt|Sure hope the pass is worth this much coin.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|You've made the right decision. Won't regret it.
Geralt|No deal.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! Hold up!
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Might have a little work for you… Reduce the price for a job well done. Eh?
Geralt|What kind of work?
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Nearby, just to the south-east, me sister's husband's got a business. He and some lads tidy up battlefields.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Problem is there's always swarms of shite botherin' 'em - you know, them monsters drawn to corpses.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Give 'im some protection, and I'll swing you one beautiful discount.
Geralt|Gotta think it over. So long.
Geralt|What's your offer, then? 'Cause I already ran into your brother-in-law. He and his men can work in peace.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Ahh, well then, that changes everythin'!
Geralt|That's better.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Pleasure doin' business with yous.
Geralt|Actually ran into your brother-in-law, tended to the monsters, too, but… He, uh, was killed.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|What?! You pullin' me leg?!
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Forget my offer! It's off the table, you git!
Geralt|I think you'll swing me a discount just because.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Aye. Good idea. Discount's yours, my friend.
Geralt|All right, see what I can do.
Geralt|What kind of pass are we talking about?
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|You don't know? Redanians hold all the fords 'cross the Pontar. Can't get through without a pass.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|But! You're in luck - so happens I've got a few to sell.
Geralt|Think I know who you're talking about…
Geralt|Problem is, I don't help men like him.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|If you don't, you don't. Every man's got his reasons. No discount, I'm afraid.
Geralt|Think I saw your brother-in-law, but walked on by… Maybe I can go back?
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Forget about it, they're done by now. Were to stop there only briefly, then move on.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Tough, no discount, gonna pay the full price?
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Oh, you again. Lookin' for a pass? I got a special price for you.
Geralt|Maybe you could… drop the price a bit?
<|endoftext|>
Redanian Soldier 01|Another one? Run along home with the rest.
Novigrad Peasant 02|Sir, show some mercy! We've not got nowhere to go. For us, it's Novigrad or death.
Redanian Soldier 01|Had enough of you lot! Sod off! Or I'll have you skewered!
Geralt|They seem desperate. Let 'em through. Can't see any harm in it.
Redanian Soldier 01|Fuckin' hell, 'ow many times have I gotta repeat this - I've orders to turn back anyone who don't show a pass!
Geralt|King's a long way away, and your pay's probably meager. Sure we can't make a deal?
Redanian Soldier 01|Mean to say you're lookin' to uh - ahem - purchase a one-time pass?
Geralt|Exactly.
Redanian Soldier 01|Ah, that's a whole other conversation. Way's clear.
Geralt|Let these people pass.
Redanian Soldier 01|Yes, sir.
Geralt|Let 'em through, before I get angry.
Redanian Soldier 01|Huh? That a threat?
Redanian Soldier 01|You'll not talk to me that way, oh no! We're done! Get 'im!
Geralt|Sorry, can't get involved. You're on your own.
Novigrad Peasant 02|Master, sir!
Redanian Soldier 01|Enough! Gather up and go! Scram!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Hand over the documents, thief.
Novigrad Poor Man 01|Me? A thief? I won 'em straight, I did, in a game of cards!
Geralt|Not how Muggs sees it. Claims he was… mugged.
Novigrad Poor Man 01|He lost, demanded them papers back, and when I refused he walloped me over the noggin with a bottle. Barely escaped with me life.
Geralt|Listen, it's like this: either give me the papers, or I'll take 'em from you.
Novigrad Poor Man 01|Think I frighten that easy?!
Geralt|Played cards for them once. Care to play again?
Novigrad Poor Man 01|Hm.
Geralt|You're clearly in the middle of a lucky streak. Could very well continue.
Novigrad Poor Man 01|You might be right. Let's play.
Geralt|How much're they worth to you?
Novigrad Poor Man 01|I don't read, meself, but I seen the seals. I know it ain't no scrap of arsewipe. I won't sell 'em to the first fella comes askin'.
Geralt|Give me the papers. You have to.
Novigrad Poor Man 01|True. Definite.
Geralt|I'll be back.
Novigrad Poor Man 01|Hm?
Geralt|I win.
Novigrad Poor Man 01|I ain't blind. Take the damn things. Let none say I ain't an honest man.
Geralt|Gods know I'll only ever say kind things about you.
Geralt|You win.
Novigrad Poor Man 01|Sure did - hahahaha! Still got the touch!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What do you want?
Dwarf Man 02|Name's Muggs, Rostan Muggs. Need your help in a grave matter.
Geralt|What's this grave matter?
Dwarf Man 02|I came here on business. Sadly, just there across the river, toward the bridge's end, I was attacked.
Dwarf Man 02|Smashed a bottle of the finest dwarven spirit on the bugger's skull, but the robbery was still a partial success.
Geralt|Tell me what you want already. And be brief.
Dwarf Man 02|Thief ran off with me documents. Very important documents. I'd need you to get 'em back for me.
Geralt|It'll cost you. I don't work for free.
Dwarf Man 02|That I know… Since the dawn o' time, no witcher's lifted a finger without pay. I've a smatterin' o' coin in the soles of me boots. Return the documents, and it's yours.
Geralt|Fine. See what I can do.
Geralt|And you think this is witchers' work because…?
Dwarf Man 02|Why wouldn't it be?
Geralt|Well, not like your papers were stolen by a manticore or a drowner…
Geralt|Sorry. You'll have to get someone else to help you.
Dwarf Man 02|Swarmy goatfucker! Here I tell you me troubles, trust you like a brother, and this is how you repay me?! A pox eat your stones!
Geralt|Found the thief who took your documents.
Dwarf Man 02|Ah, it can't be! Let's go get 'im! You can hold 'im while I take what's mine.
Geralt|Slow down. See, this man said he never attacked you. Said you lost to him at cards.
Dwarf Man 02|Ach, cheeky bastard! But like me Aunt Rosalie always said, lies got but wee legs and don't run far.
Dwarf Man 02|The documents belong to me employer. A deed to a townhouse in Vengerberg. And true enough - I'd been drinkin'… got a bit carried away. And I lost 'em in a game o' cards.
Geralt|Then you whacked the winner on the head with a bottle.
Dwarf Man 02|Wh-wh-what was I to do? He weren't willin' to give 'em back! When the scoundrel drew a weapon, I fled. But without them papers, I havenae the gumption to show me face at home.
Geralt|Here. Now pay up.
Dwarf Man 02|Of course I will! Give ye all I've left. Wouldnae have it any other way!
Geralt|All right. I'll see what I can do.
Geralt|Seem really valuable to you, these papers. Think you oughta pay me more.
Dwarf Man 02|More, but how? I ain't got more.
Geralt|Don't have time for this now. So long.
Dwarf Man 02|Well?
<|endoftext|>
Redanian Soldier 01|Halt! Stand and duel! I challenge you!
Geralt|Boots a bit big, maybe? Careful not to trip.
Redanian Soldier 01|Halt, I say! I am Ronvid of the Small Marsh, bound by a sacred oath…
Geralt|Ooh, that's rough. My sympathies.
Redanian Soldier 01|… to honor Maid Bilberry, fairest of all maids I know, by dueling a hundred knights to the death. Now draw your sword posthaste, for I've ninety-nine left after you.
Geralt|At your service. Let's get this over with.
Geralt|Hm, why're you challenging me? Don't recall doing anything to offend the Maid Bilberry.
Redanian Soldier 01|Well… Why… Uhm… Then swear - swear Maid Bilberry's the most loveliest of all!
Geralt|Thing is, I've never laid eyes on her.
Redanian Soldier 01|Ahah! Ahh! I shall wash your scorn away with thy blood, fiend! Stand and fight!
<|endoftext|>
Redanian Soldier 01|Prepare for battle! You shall not have it easy this time.
Geralt|Brought friends? Hm. They all pledge to defend Maid Bilberry's honor, too?
Redanian Soldier 01|Noo… No, no, they defend justice - for it is only fair you face a threesome.
Geralt|Is that so?
Redanian Soldier 01|Yes! For you are a rogue and a cheat, sir! You never revealed yourself to be a witcher!
Geralt|You never asked. But, since you've all gone to the trouble… Let's fight.
Geralt|You're right - guess you had no choice in that case. But I'm still not gonna fight you.
Redanian Soldier 01|You must! Or I shall cut you down, honorably, though without mercy!
Geralt|You'd better go home. Get some sleep. Think things over tomorrow.
Redanian Soldier 01|Wise words.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Don't know about you two, but I'm feelin' a bit sleepy.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|We're done here…
<|endoftext|>
Redanian Soldier 01|Yes, luck stood with you! B-but the next time we meet…
Geralt|Challenge me again - raise your hand, draw your sword, look at me the wrong way… and I'll kill you.
Redanian Soldier 01|You so sure o' that?
Geralt|Yes.
Redanian Soldier 01|We shall see!
Geralt|Go back to Maid Bilberry and apologize for being an ass. Quick, before I change my mind and break your bones.
Redanian Soldier 01|We shall meet again!
Redanian Soldier 01|Yes, but next time…
Geralt|Had enough?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What's this about?
Elf Man 02|This dh'oine sold fisstech to some young elves. A contaminated batch that killed every other user.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Lies! They mean to kill me, steal my gold! Help me! Please!
Elf Man 01|What you sold was poison! Shame you weren't there to see the young lad and others expire amidst spasms.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|You, all of you to an… elf, you despise humans, seek vengeance on us! But can you fault us, fault me for your civilization's downfall?!
Elf Man 03|Shut your mouth, poisoner.
Geralt|Don't see any proof this man sold anyone fisstech, let alone contaminated powder. Can't let you kill him.
Elf Man 02|Then you, too, shall die, vatt'ghern. Shame you happened on our path… and chose to stand in our way.
Geralt|Just the sale of fisstech is bad enough. But offering contaminated powder - it's malicious, something that has to carry punishment.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|No! Don't let them murder me, you can't!
Elf Man 02|Thank you, vatt'ghern - for letting us do what was only right. Va fail.
Geralt|Need to see if this man's actually carrying any fisstech.
Elf Man 02|We've done that already, checked everywhere, even his boots. Nothing! The bastard sold it all, which hardly makes him innocent.
<|endoftext|>
Temerian Bandit 03|Unbind me! 'Fore the next ones come!
Geralt|When they come, I'll tend to them. Meanwhile… let's you and me chat. Like to know who I'm untying.
Temerian Bandit 03|John Verdun. Served in the 10th Maribor Division…
Geralt|Long way from your army.
Temerian Bandit 03|Me army don't exist no more. Black Ones smashed it to bits… I scarpered off into the woods just 'fore that happened.
Temerian Bandit 03|Joined a group of refugees… Fuckin' burstin' with patriotism, they were. Soon as they learned I'd abandoned Temeria in her hour of need, they beat me down, tied me up like a turkey, left me to the drowners.
Geralt|Fine. I'll help.
Temerian Bandit 03|Phew, thanks. For a minute there, was almost sure you'd leave me to die.
Temerian Bandit 03|Like to thank you somehow… But I've not a chipped crown to my name.
Geralt|Tough. I'll take the loss.
Temerian Bandit 03|Thanks, witcher. May you prosper on the Path!
Geralt|Sorry, can't help you.
Temerian Bandit 03|What? Why not?
Geralt|Find it hard to believe the folks from the camp left you here just 'cause you're a deserter.
Temerian Bandit 03|All right, mighta been other factors involved! But is that any reason to leave me to a certain death?
Geralt|Not that certain… You could wiggle free. Just keep quiet… drowners might not notice you.
<|endoftext|>
Temerian Bandit 03|Witcher! John Verdun, remember? You saved me from the drowners!
Temerian Bandit 03|Was copperless then… Now, why, me purse's burstin'!
Geralt|Mhm. With coin that belonged to the refugees. Vengeance taste sweet?
Temerian Bandit 03|I thought you'd come for your reward. I'll gladly pay, mind you. You saved me life - no two ways about it.
Temerian Bandit 03|But if you're lookin' for a bruisin'… well, you'll find it.
Geralt|Shoulda left you there, tied up, right at the water's edge.
Temerian Bandit 03|Well, you can't turn back time… But I'm willin' to see to it your conscience don't torment you long.
Temerian Bandit 03|Get him!
Geralt|Coin doesn't stink. Give it here.
Temerian Bandit 03|There y'are. May it multiply in your purse! Now go.
Temerian Bandit 03|It's you!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What happened here?
Verden Scavenger 01|Ye stupid or blind? It's clear as day!
Verden Scavenger 03|Tis also clear he's a witcher. Spare 'im your lip and answer!
Verden Scavenger 01|I knows as much as yous - meanin' nothin'. But with a little learnin', corpses can be read like books. Black 'uns, see? Fought the Reds, for the bridge.
Verden Scavenger 03|We's merely seein' to it that, uh… nothin' goes to waste. Take this fine sword, for example - found it in the rushes… Maybe you'd like to buy it?
Geralt|Well, not like it can be useful to a dead man.
Verden Scavenger 01|Truly reasoned! May it serve you, instead!
Geralt|A dead man's sword? No thanks.
Verden Scavenger 01|Dead or quick - who cares 'bout some previous owner? Sword cuts the same, regardless. But if it's not to your likin', fine.
<|endoftext|>
Verden Peasant 01|Whoa, whoa! This here's a toll crossin'.
Geralt|By what right?
Verden Peasant 01|By the right of a prick up your backside, wisearse! Pay up or start fuckin' swimmin'!
Geralt|Fine… I'll pay.
Verden Peasant 01|Bit of a shame, that. Would've liked the practice… But coin's not bad either. Ride on!
Geralt|Lemme through.
Verden Peasant 01|Right, move on. Road's open.
Geralt|I'll cross - but I'm not gonna pay you a broken copper.
Verden Peasant 01|Broken's what your jaw'll be once our clubs're done with it! Votmir, have at the thrifty fucker!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Roasted a dog?
Geralt|Must've been pretty darn hungry.
Geralt|Come out! I'm not gonna hurt you.
Geralt|When'd you last eat?
Verden Girl 02|A week back. Half a charred squirrel. And a handful o' berries.
Geralt|Here. Be sure to share it with the others.
Verden Girl 02|Thank you!
Verden Girl 02|Here, for you. For your kindness.
Geralt|Don't have any food, but maybe this'll help.
Geralt|Why're you out here alone? Where are your parents?
Verden Girl 02|Black 'uns killed some of them. Others kicked us out themselves. Too many mouths to feed, they said…
Geralt|Well, farewell. And good luck.
Verden Girl 02|Good luck to you, too, master.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Peasant 02|Barn's full up with some manner of beast! Barred them inside, but that won't hold long. And we'll be in a world o' woe once they're loose!
Novigrad Peasant 01|We're not rich, but cut the filth down and we will pay you.
Geralt|Fine. I'll try to help you.
Novigrad Peasant 01|We'll let you in the barn, then open the doors once it's over.
Novigrad Peasant 01|Quick, master witcher! Or they'll get out!
Geralt|Sorry. Can't help just now.
Novigrad Peasant 01|Didn't I say as much?
Novigrad Peasant 02|Master witcher! You've returned! Will you help?
Geralt|Not an expert or anything, but you two look like you could use some help.
Novigrad Peasant 02|Aye, it's true, we could.
Geralt|You're right. So long.
Novigrad Peasant 02|You daft? That was a witcher!
Novigrad Peasant 02|Master witcher! Wait!
Geralt|I'm listening.
Geralt|What's all this?
Novigrad Peasant 01|Not your concern, that's what!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Use that barn as a cemetery?
Novigrad Peasant 01|Uhh… No… Why d'you ask?
Geralt|Found human remains inside. Several sets. They're what drew the necrophages.
Novigrad Peasant 01|They was… They was bandits. When it were just coin they took, we lived and let live, so to speak…
Novigrad Peasant 01|But when they dragged Heddy to the barn, we wouldn't take no more! Grabbed our pitchforks and… well, you seen how it ended.
Geralt|Job's done…
Novigrad Peasant 01|True enough. Here's your pay. And thanks for your help.
Geralt|Farewell.
Geralt|Next time you kill someone, bury the bodies. Deep. Need to take care of these, too, or they'll attract more corpse eaters.
Novigrad Peasant 01|We'll do it. Thank you, master witcher.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Greetings.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|What is it? Hm?
Redanian Soldier 03|Don't mind him. Sit with us.
Redanian Townsman 03|You're most welcome to. Though be warned - we're in the middle of some serious studyin', as our learned companion calls it.
Geralt|Kind of you to let me join you. And it just so happens I've got something to warm us up.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Well! The kind of guest I like! I shall find some mugs.
Redanian Townsman 03|Day full of surprises, truly.
Redanian Soldier 03|You saved us - we'd just drained our last bottle. What do they call you?
Geralt|I'm Geralt of Rivia. I'm a witcher.
Redanian Soldier 03|They call me Rufus, and this here learned fellow is Theophile Maria Rosco, and this is… sorry…
Redanian Townsman 03|Manfred. I'm Manfred.
Redanian Soldier 03|Exactly. Hm - Geralt… Heard that name before. You frequent the fairs?
Geralt|Nope.
Redanian Townsman 03|You've confused him with Gerard, the stage artist who, indeed, attends fairs and breaks wind to the tune of popular melodies. To the delight of the crowds, I'd add. Our guest is none other than the White Wolf himself.
Redanian Soldier 03|Well, my apologies. Ain't you the one that… you know, the rumors about Foltest's death…
Geralt|No. Wasn't me.
Redanian Soldier 03|Oh.
Geralt|Any news? Of the war, for instance?
Redanian Townsman 03|They say the Black Ones'll mount a new offensive soon, to cross the Pontar. I bet diamonds to peanuts Radovid won't manage to repel this time.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Such a shame Henselt perished in Lormark. Blasted Dragonslayer.
Redanian Soldier 03|Right you are. With Henselt alive, Nilfgaard wouldn't 'ave had it so easy in the east.
Redanian Townsman 03|The emperor's sure to take Novigrad soon. He'll seize the Temple vault, the city armada. The west'll be all but his as well.
Redanian Soldier 03|You know a lot for an ordinary merchant.
Redanian Townsman 03|I do. What of it? Hm?
Redanian Soldier 03|Just that it makes me like you even less. First you ask about the message I'm carryin'. Now you say you're waitin' for Nilfgaard to cross the Pontar.
Redanian Soldier 03|You'd better come with me. I know some people who'd want to talk to you.
Redanian Townsman 03|You'll have to kill me first.
Redanian Soldier 03|If needs must.
Geralt|Leave him alone.
Redanian Soldier 03|A Nilfgaardian spy in league with Foltest's murderer?
Redanian Soldier 03|I'll take you both on.
Geralt|Relax. A misunderstanding, that's all this is.
Redanian Soldier 03|Hold him, witcher. I'll find a rope.
Redanian Townsman 03|Hah! Not a chance!
Geralt|All right, I'll grab him.
Redanian Townsman 03|Most you'll grab is your own cock!
Geralt|Sorry, not about to get involved.
Redanian Soldier 03|I'll fuckin' manage on my own!
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Shame Henselt perished in the battle for Lormark. Now there was a king! He'd have rebuffed the Black Ones.
Geralt|Time I was on my way. Thanks for your hospitality.
Redanian Townsman 03|Stay a while. Road's no hare, it won't run off.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|If he's in a rush, let him go.
Redanian Soldier 03|Take care, master witcher.
Geralt|I'm no one special. Fellow traveler, that's all.
Redanian Townsman 03|Fine thing, that, sittin' down with folk and not introducin' yourself. Maybe you have something to hide?
Redanian Soldier 03|Not this again. If he doesn't want to, then he needn't talk.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Indeed, it's rather suspicious…
Redanian Townsman 03|Mighty suspicious. Best introduce yourself, mate - we don't like spies.
Geralt|Don't wanna cause any trouble. Farewell to you.
Redanian Townsman 03|Hah! Told you - a spy.
Redanian Soldier 03|Damn, maybe he is.
Redanian Townsman 03|I'll not let a spy walk free! To arms, gentlemen!
Geralt|Shit.
Geralt|Thanks. Be happy to join you.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|What do they call you?
Geralt|Love to sit down, but got a long road ahead.
Redanian Soldier 03|War and death all around. You might take time to enjoy life a bit, seize the moment.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|It's no wonder we're losing this war. Behold - a paragon of the Northern army seizing moments instead of fighting the Black Ones.
Geralt|I'll leave you to it. Cheers.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Good luck to you on your travels.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Rich Man 03|He's dead.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|You should go.
Redanian Townsman 03|Dog's bollocks, I didn't want to kill him.
Geralt|Mighta thought of that beforehand.
Redanian Townsman 03|Aaargh…
Redanian Soldier 03|Let's search his body. Might've been carryin' documents, a message.
Geralt|You're on your own.
Redanian Soldier 03|Thanks for your help - one Nilfgaardian spy less.
Redanian Soldier 03|Take this. It oughta prove useful.
Redanian Soldier 03|One Nilfgaardian mole less.
Geralt|Can't actually know he was a spy.
Redanian Soldier 03|Oh, he was, he was. I know them on sight. Seen my share
Redanian Soldier 03|On your way, now. You're no use to us.
Redanian Soldier 03|Fuckin' neutrality… Fatherland needs to be defended.
Redanian Soldier 03|Ah! Had it right. Purse full of Nilfgaardian florens.
<|endoftext|>
Verden Peasant 03|Oh look, we got ourselves a customer.
Geralt|Not about to buy anything from you.
Verden Peasant 03|Afraid you're mistaken. If we're to let you pass, you gotta pay.
Geralt|And if I don't?
Verden Peasant 03|Heheheh, then you die.
Geralt|Tell you what. Give you a chance to earn something. Anything you take off me, you get to keep.
Geralt|See this medallion?
Baron Bandit Weak 03|Uh, gaffer… gaffer!
Verden Peasant 03|Shut it, Sobek. Aye. Now I see it. We didn't mean no--
Geralt|Recognize the guild?
Verden Peasant 03|Aye, master. Forgive us for not remarkin' on it earlier, please…
Baron Bandit Weak 03|Gaffer! Gaffer!
Geralt|Now listen. Might pass through again. Some day, dunno when. But when I do, I don't wanna run into you. That clear?
Verden Peasant 03|As a summer's day, m'lord! Gods speed you on your Path!
<|endoftext|>
Verden Woman 05|You didn't find him?
Geralt|No, I did, but…
Verden Woman 05|Naye, don't say it. It's clear from your face. Please, take this coin.
Geralt|Thanks. And I truly am sorry.
Geralt|Can't accept this coin. I'm sorry I wasn't able to bring him back alive.
Verden Woman 05|Might I at least fetch his body?
Geralt|Wouldn't advise it, it's dangerous. If you decide to go anyway… it's near his snares.
Verden Woman 05|Thank ye… Farewell.
Verden Woman 05|Ah, 'tis you… Greetin's.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|We know each other?
Verden Old Man 03|Not personal, like, though I've seen ye many times.
Verden Old Man 03|I've a gift. I see the future. Yours as well…
Geralt|But not for free, I guess…
Verden Old Man 03|I don't ask much. If you've a bite to eat…
Geralt|Lemme get you something.
Geralt|Here.
Verden Old Man 03|Thank ye. A fine offerin', well worth a foretellin'.
Geralt|Ahh, all right, let's hear it.
Geralt|Been having these visions long?
Verden Old Man 03|Since I were a tyke. Me mother took me to the village witch once. I fells into her cauldron full of some magic brew.
Geralt|Mhm. Seriously?
Verden Old Man 03|If I'm to tell it serious, 'twere as a youth that I got hit in the back of me head with a rock. Started seein' more'n others.
Geralt|Sorry, I don't have time for this.
Verden Old Man 03|May ye not want for time when it is truly needed…
Verden Old Man 03|I see a white wolf. He looks on as the Great Viper bites and devours the Silver Lily. He wants to spring, he wants to fight, but the serpent is quicker. The lily must perish.
Geralt|That's not the future. Lived through that - and you probably heard about it in some ballad.
Verden Old Man 03|My third eye grows foggier the older I become… but if you brought me some dragonsroot…
Geralt|Rare plant.
Verden Old Man 03|Rare, indeed, but it did once grow in a cave southeast of here.
Geralt|Fine. I'll see what I can do.
Geralt|Not that interested in seeing if it still does.
Verden Old Man 03|Yet without dragonsroot I cannot hope to foresee your future…
Geralt|Think I'll survive. Farewell.
Verden Old Man 03|I see a white wolf, he enters an endless cavern. He sings a hymn of madness and despair, summoning that which is not dead, for it cannot die.
Verden Old Man 03|Oh, you're back.
Geralt|Got what you asked for.
Verden Old Man 03|Thank ye, now I need a moment.
Verden Old Man 03|I see a wolf, strivin' forward towards a solitary tower, 'midst a blizzard.
Verden Old Man 03|He follows the swallow. Yet the swallow does not heed the wolf's howls, soarin' higher and higher, for it knows 'tis its last flight…
Verden Old Man 03|Ess'tuath esse! So shall it be! Look for the signs! The world will perish amidst ice and be reborn with the new sun!
Verden Old Man 03|Reborn of the Elder Blood, of Hen Ichaer, of a planted seed…
Geralt|Ithlinne's prophecy.
Verden Old Man 03|Leave me be. Go. Go now.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Got any witchers' work for me?
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Ah, yes. You witchers are said to be excellent trackers. If this is true, you may indeed be able to aid me.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Some days ago I sent a unit of scouts to the wood across the lake. None has returned.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Find my men, bring them back to camp. I will pay you well… as it stands in the notice and not a copper more, mind you. We must have order in the ledgers as well.
Geralt|Fine. I'll look into it.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Begin your search across the lake. We saw them cross. And good luck, witcher.
Geralt|Local peasants don't exactly see you as liberators.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Say what you mean, witcher.
Geralt|Small unit, isolated area - might've gone at your men with pitchforks.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|A handful of yokels in ragged foot-wrappings cut down a unit of imperial scouts? What else? Perhaps a dragon ate them? Esse bloede joc.
Geralt|Why'd your men go to the woods? Any specific reason?
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|None, A patrol, as the code ordains.
Geralt|Not my kind of work. Need to figure it out yourself.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|I see… Should you change your mind, you know where to find me.
Geralt|Found your notice.
Geralt|The contract we discussed. What was it about?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Found your soldiers. Meaning, their bodies.
Geralt|Female wyvern killed them. They wandered into her hunting ground.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|A wyvern? Bloede pest.
Geralt|Your men must've provoked her.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|I see. Thank you, witcher. Your reward - as in the notice. Va fail.
Geralt|Discovered something else. You didn't send those boys out to scout. That was a death squad, led some Redanian prisoners out there, executed them.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|War is like this. Who loses, dies.
Geralt|I don't want your coin.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Dead men buried in the woods - you are offended? They died honorably… if soldiers who let themselves be captured can have honor.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Here in Velen, hunger is our greatest foe. What was I to feed those prisoners, eh? Grass and mud? It was an act of mercy.
Geralt|You're a murderer - plain and simple.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|I am an imperial quartermaster. And we are done, witcher.
Geralt|Pay up, Nilfgaardian. Don't have the slightest desire to debate with you.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Nor I you. You have earned this coin. Take it… And leave me.
Geralt|Those men haven't been forgotten. Someone'll come asking about them.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|In Nilfgaard, any soldier who is taken prisoner is as if dead.
Geralt|Those prisoners were from Redania.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Soon to be an imperial province. Before Saovine, I wager, the Great Sun will fly upon banners above Redania's capital.
Geralt|You happen to lose a unit recently?
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|One is missing, yes. Did you find my notice?
Geralt|No. Found their bodies.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|You look tired, quartermaster. Been stationed here long?
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Too long. But the day will come when the emperor's banner will fly first over Novigrad, then over Tretogor. And we will all go home.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Who are you? Why do you sniff around here?
Geralt|Looking for work.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Wait, wait… Two swords, eyes like slits - you are a witcher, is that so?
Geralt|Geralt of Rivia.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|I have not heard the name, but you will find work here. This I know.
Geralt|Greetings, quartermaster.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Honor and glory, Geralt! How can I help?
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Still wandering about the camp? Careful, they could name you a spy.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Do my best to help you.
Nilfgaardian Woman Old 01|You will not regret it. There is nothing I would not do for Hrodberth. Remember this.
Geralt|I'll ask around, see if I can learn something.
Nilfgaardian Woman Old 01|My servant strove to do the same. He drank with the soldiery in the mess, but met no one from my son's company. It is as if it has ceased to exist.
Nilfgaardian Woman Old 01|You must speak to the quartermaster. He is dismissive of me, but he will be more candid with you. I can feel it. A mother feels these things.
Geralt|Guess we'll see…
Geralt|Sorry, Just not in my line of work, finding soldiers who've gone missing. But I do hope you find him, ma'am. Alive.
Nilfgaardian Woman Old 01|I have come from far away… I… to seek my son. He served in the Nazairi cavalry. I must find him. I simply must.
Geralt|I'm not one of your soldiers.
Nilfgaardian Woman Old 01|This is good. Our army refused to help. Yet help is what I need. So much so I will ask a rock troll, if required.
Geralt|Interesting train of thought, ma'am…
Geralt|Don't mean to dash your hopes, but not all soldiers come home from war.
Nilfgaardian Woman Old 01|I know what war is. My husband fell at Brenna. But I had his body brought home to Nilfgaard, buried there. I will do the same for my son.
Nilfgaardian Woman Old 01|If I must.
Nilfgaardian Woman Old 01|I require someone's help to find Hrodberth… or his body. Coin is no object.
Geralt|What's your son look like?
Nilfgaardian Woman Old 01|Unlike others, easily distinguished. In all Nilfgaard's army, I do not think there was another with his mane… The color of fire…
Geralt|A red-haired Nilfgaardian?
Nilfgaardian Woman Old 01|His father hailed from Mag Turga. Folk have light complexions there. My son inherited this trait, and others, from his father…
Nilfgaardian Woman Old 01|May I count on your help?
Geralt|His brothers in arms tell you anything?
Nilfgaardian Woman Old 01|Some will not speak at all, others lie. This… quartermaster, for instance. He told me Hrodberth, my son, left the camp to scout… and did not return.
Geralt|Why, is that… unlikely?
Nilfgaardian Woman Old 01|He serves in the light cavalry. Nazairi Brigade. My son was no scout.
Geralt|Why'd you decide to look for your son, now?
Nilfgaardian Woman Old 01|He wrote letters - to me, to his fiancé… regularly. They would come in the post each week. And suddenly they stopped.
Nilfgaardian Woman Old 01|This was unlike him. Something had happened, I knew.
<|endoftext|>
Nilfgaardian Woman Old 01|My son - were you able to learn anything?
Geralt|I was…
Nilfgaardian Woman Old 01|I wish to know the truth… Be it sweet, be it painful, I wish to know.
Geralt|Your son is dead.
Nilfgaardian Woman Old 01|How did it happen…?
Geralt|His unit was ambushed. They fought bravely, but…
Nilfgaardian Woman Old 01|So he perished a hero… Just as his father before him.
Nilfgaardian Woman Old 01|I wish to lay his body in the family crypt. At home…
Geralt|Afraid that won't be possible. He was killed in the swamp…
Nilfgaardian Woman Old 01|I cannot even do this for him…? He is to lay in a foreign land?
Nilfgaardian Woman Old 01|Though… not for long. This will be Nilfgaard soon. My son did not die in vain.
Nilfgaardian Woman Old 01|I thank you for all you have done. Your payment.
Geralt|Farewell.
Geralt|He deserted. Was caught, then hanged.
Nilfgaardian Woman Old 01|Lies!
Geralt|Found him hanging next to others. Notice posted on the tree was clear…
Nilfgaardian Woman Old 01|I do not believe you. My son was no coward.
Geralt|Believe what you will. Found a letter on him. Addressed to you.
Nilfgaardian Woman Old 01|Mother, This may well be the last time I write. In all my letters, I have lied. Forgive me. I am no hero. I take no pleasure in killing Nordlings.
Nilfgaardian Woman Old 01|This place is a nightmare. I have borne it until now, I can bear it no longer. Not long past, they ordered us to murder prisoners. Do you know what this means - to kill defenseless men?
Nilfgaardian Woman Old 01|I must flee this place…
Nilfgaardian Woman Old 01|My darling child, forever… you have found him for me. Your payment, take it.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Ran into a woman, Nilfgaardian, who's looking for her son.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|I knew this one was stubborn. I did not know she would hire a witcher.
Geralt|Let's say a mother's tears moved me.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|What if all Nilfgaard's mothers came to find their sons? Can you imagine?
Geralt|Only met one. And promised to help her.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|I'm to reveal our troop movements to some Nordling…
Geralt|Maybe a coin pouch'll untie your tongue.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|You seek to bribe an imperial officer?
Geralt|Exactly. But just because I want to help an imperial soldier's mother. Take the coin and tell me what you know.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Red-haired whelp, Nazairi cavalry. A short time ago, he and several of his company sought to desert. I ordered them pursued.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|We caught some in the swamp, not far from here. Others managed to flee.
Geralt|The men you caught - what happened to them?
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|We hanged them - wartime rules. But I cannot say the red-haired boy was among them.
Geralt|Hm. You're a Nilfgaardian officer. Expected you to be more conscientious.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|If I had reported that any had fled, I would have had to pursue them. I've neither the time nor the resources. So I wrote that all are dead. Unlikely any survived long in the swamp.
Geralt|See if I can't find them.
Geralt|Now focus. And tell me everything you know.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Yes, I will.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|So you come to a murderer for help? I believed you the honorable sort.
Geralt|Just wanna help a Nilfgaardian woman.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|And I do not wish to see you again. Understood?
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|You helped me once. I suppose I must return the favor. But I do not know what happened to this whelp.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|He was a problem from the start. Preferred a quill and inkwell to a sword. He scratched away incessantly.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Not long past, his unit was decimated by the foe. Ambushed in the swamp nearby.
Geralt|Why'd you withhold this from his mother?
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|By imperial order, we are not to inform civilians of defeats, lost men and units. Also, we never found his body. Perhaps he survived…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Definitely didn't die in a fight… Never known soldiers to go into battle with their hands bound.
Geralt|Red… Just extinguished the mother's last ray of hope…
Geralt|Got a notice. These men were executed for cowardice…
Geralt|Letter to his mother… Least I can do is get it to her. But that's it.
Geralt|Dog tracks… It's as if they were pursued.
Geralt|Tried to run, but got stuck in the bog… Great target for an arbalist.
Geralt|Black hair… Not who I'm looking for.
Geralt|That's not him…
Geralt|Deserters tried to flee on horseback. Were caught here, looks like…
Geralt|Fled into the swamp.
Geralt|Red hair… Probably him. Need to find something else to know for sure.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What're you doing here?
Verden Peasant 04|What? This 'un fly in from the moon? We're makin' offerin's to the Allgod, clearly.
Verden Peasant 02|You too can seek His aid… That's if you've got fittin' offerin's. He scorned ours, then cursed the whole village.
Geralt|So, what's wrong with your offerings?
Verden Peasant 02|Ye needn't mock us. Ye can see right well we've brought scraps. 'Fore the war, I wouldn't give this such to me hounds… But what can we do? Such're the times.
Verden Peasant 04|And they're like to get worse. Allgod said if he don't get a rafter o' bacon and a barrel o' beer at least, the rivers'll fill up with frogs, and lotusks or somesuch'll devour the harvest!
Geralt|I could intercede on your behalf with this Allgod of yours. Got a feeling we'd come to an understanding.
Verden Peasant 02|Well, I s'pose it can't hurt to try… To speak with him, you've to stand afore the altar and cry out, "Allgod! Help a poor wretch in need!" Who knows, he might just listen to a foreigner.
Geralt|Can't help you at the moment… except with a bit of advice. Find a god who prefers incense to bacon.
Geralt|Got good news. Your god's dead. It was actually a run-of-the-mill monster - sentient but mean, took advantage of you. You went hungry, while it grew new chins.
Verden Peasant 04|What've you done! The Allgod warned us… Said if he ever departed death would await us all! C'mon, Trebor, we must tell the others… Only group prayer can save us now.
Geralt|Talked to your Allgod. Face to face.
Verden Peasant 04|And? Will he show us mercy?
Geralt|He will. Promised to be pleased with whatever you bring.
Verden Peasant 02|Told ye! Told ye the Allgod's merciful, understanding! Thanks, witcher!
Geralt|Oh, one last thing… did you know there's a crypt beneath this hill? Might wanna take a look sometime. Architecture's fascinating.
Geralt|Farewell. The Allgod show you favor.
Geralt|Sadly, the Allgod wouldn't bend. Seems this shepherd's got a stern hand for his flock.
Verden Peasant 04|Told ye, Trebor… Won't move 'im with tears. We gotta empty our larders.
Geralt|The Allgod, you call him. First I've heard. This some new deity?
Verden Peasant 02|Nay, 'tis ancient, revered by our forefathers. They say it were like this: Roslav of Oreton came here to gather brushwood. Suddenly, for no reason, a bush burst into flame! Then Roslav heard a voice from the ground, demandin' offerin's and obedience!
Verden Peasant 04|We been comin' 'ere since then, bearin' gifts. In exchange for which the Allgod watches over us, keeps us from evil.
Geralt|Mhm. Plain to see, that.
Geralt|So long.
Geralt|Ah, right. Know him. Personally, even.
Verden Peasant 02|Tain't true, is it?! Ye seen 'im with your own gawkers?!
Verden Peasant 02|But he don't answer. To our thinkin', he's grown angry with our pitiful offerin's, abandoned Velen.
Verden Peasant 04|Anythin' new?
Verden Peasant 04|Nothin's changed, master witcher. Allgod still refuses our offerin's… Curse ain't lifted, not nowheres.
Verden Peasant 04|Tell us, master… Were he terrible angered at our meagre offerin's?
<|endoftext|>
Fugas|You think this a jest, mortal?! Whosoever looks upon my godliness… must die!
Geralt|Huh, expected the Allgod to be corporeal in form… but never thought he'd be… corpulent. Fattened up nicely at those peasants' expense.
Fugas|Expense? Expense?! Not a word 'bout the help I give in return - blessin's, absolutions, enlightened advice? Believe me, these folks need all of it! I'd watch over 'em still if they fulfilled their end. But lately they offer these pathetic scraps.
Geralt|…That they steal from the mouths of their children. And to make matters worse, you cast a curse on them.
Fugas|And I'll not lift it till they bring me worthy offerings! I'm to settle for curds and whey? Not a chance. And you can tell them that!
Geralt|Got an idea how to resolve this. I'll just kill you.
Geralt|Listen here, lardass. You're gonna be satisfied with what you get, or I'll feed you to the ravens.
Fugas|Ploughin' reformers… Fine, fine. I'll sup more modestly… but just till the end of the war! Not one day longer!
Geralt|Fine, I'll tell 'em what you want… but they'll carry you outta here on pitchforks one day. You'll see.
Geralt|Been in this hole long?
Fugas|For a century or so. One winter I found shelter here, built a fire so large the flames leapt through the crack, lit the bushes above. I coughed from the smoke… and suddenly heard a peasant. "A voice outta nowhere," he called, "A miracle!" Thus I became a god.
Geralt|Parasite, more like.
Fugas|Maybe so. But what're Freya and Melitele, then? Demandin' prayers and offerin's, givin' naught in return? I talk, at least.
Geralt|Who the hell are you supposed to be?
Fugas|The local peasant folk call me the Allgod.
Geralt|Can think of quite a few other, more fitting nicknames.
Fugas|Now you listen to me, witcher. Have you no other duties, missions? Swamp's dangerous, got its share of true terrors. Tend to them, I harm no one.
Fugas|What…? Who dares disturb my divine being?!
Geralt|Geralt of Rivia. Pleasure…
Fugas|Maybe you'd care to go up top? See if you're still there?

Geralt|Calm down. Just wanna talk to y--
Verden Girl 02|Leave me be! Killer! Murderer!
Geralt|Got it wrong. I'm--
Verden Girl 02|You've cat eyes! Same as him!
Geralt|Same as…?
Verden Girl 02|Same as 'im! The bad man who killed everyone!
Geralt|Did he have two swords? On his back?
Verden Girl 02|Not tellin' ye nothin'! Go away!
Geralt|All right, enough. Tell me what happened here.
Verden Girl 02|Aye… I'll tell ye.
Verden Girl 02|Our woods - they was haunted. Some spook. Uncle Sobemir said we'd best fetch a witcher.
Verden Girl 02|So one came. Looked lots like you, but… there were evil in his eyes.
Verden Girl 02|He brought us the spook's head 'cept… Uncle Sobemir weren't happy 'bout somethin'. They yelled and they cursed.
Verden Girl 02|And then… they went to the barn, and… and…
Geralt|And… what?
Verden Girl 02|I'm not sure… I… I heard 'em screamin'… Uncle Sobemir… and the others.
Verden Girl 02|Then that… that witcher, he ran outta the barn, blood all over 'im. And anybody who… well, all of 'em, one by one - with his sword, like this. Me mum and me brother, too.
Verden Girl 02|He let me go. I don't know why. And then… he went thataway, towards the circle where we leave gifts for the gods. I hid… in the barn. Found this lyin' in the hay.
Geralt|School of the Cat…
Geralt|Thanks. You've been a big help. What'll you do - got any family around here?
Verden Girl 02|Me auntie. Lives in Oreton.
Geralt|I'll take you to her. But first I gotta see to this bad man.
Geralt|Wait here for me. Master Freckleface can keep you company. Stay put and keep quiet, understood?
Geralt|Sit tight, kid.
Geralt|Stay put and keep quiet, understood?
Geralt|This doll's yours, right? Hug it close and stay put, understood?
Geralt|Sh-sh-sh. Think I know the rest.
Geralt|Huh. This doll yours, maybe?
Verden Girl 02|T-tis.
Geralt|He got a name?
Verden Girl 02|M-master Freckleface.
Geralt|Hm, pretty.
Verden Girl 02|G-give 'im to me? Please?
Geralt|Doubt Master Freckleface'd be much help on the Path, so… here.
Geralt|Now, think you could tell me what happened here? I need to know.
Geralt|Oh, you'll get him back… but you gotta tell me what happened here first.
Verden Girl 02|Pinky promise?
Geralt|Cross my heart.
Geralt|That's 'cause I'm a witcher. I kill monsters.
Verden Girl 02|Said the same, that 'un! And ye seen what he done!
Geralt|Take Master Freckleface and go and find her. Travel by day. Stay on the main road and don't make any noise, got it?
Geralt|Go and find her. Travel by day. Stay on the main road and don't make any noise, got it?
Verden Girl 02|I'm cold.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|A hundred.
Lynx Witcher|Ha-ha. If only.
Lynx Witcher|Twelve. Understand, pal? Twelve fucking crowns. Barely covers my potion ingredients.
Geralt|What had you agreed to?
Lynx Witcher|That several times over. But when it came time to pay up… ah, you know the routine. "Good sir, me young 'uns are starvin'. There's a war on! Gods have mercy! Show some pity…"
Geralt|Rings a bell. But that's no reason to kill.
Lynx Witcher|I'm not finished.
Lynx Witcher|Told them I wouldn't show pity. That if I didn't see gold, they'd wish they had the leshen back. They got these grim looks… then the ealdorman spoke.
Lynx Witcher|"Calm now, master witcher. Me and the lads, we hid some gold in the barn, so's the baron's men wouldn't take it. Come, you'll get your coin right quick."
Lynx Witcher|I fell for it. Like a fool. One of 'em chattered on, while another jabbed me in the back with a pitchfork.
Geralt|So you decided to massacre the whole village.
Lynx Witcher|What would you have done? Gone to the local magistrate to file a complaint?
Lynx Witcher|I admit, I lost my temper. Lost it bad.
Lynx Witcher|I'm used to shit bounties. To the cheating, to them begging me for help, then spitting as I pass.
Lynx Witcher|But murder me - just to save a few crowns? I'm supposed to protect whoresons like that?
Lynx Witcher|So I drew steel… and didn't sheathe it till the ground was slick with blood.
Geralt|A lot of innocents died in that village.
Lynx Witcher|Yeah, they did. My fucking bad. Got carried away.
Geralt|Not the first time, either. Right?
Lynx Witcher|Wanna kill me, wolf? Fine, draw your blade. But don't force me to confess.
Geralt|Take care, now.
Lynx Witcher|That's it? Not gonna lecture me? Make me promise to mend my ways?
Geralt|They call me the Butcher of Blaviken. For good reason. I know how it is. Sometimes… sometimes heads just roll.
Lynx Witcher|Wait.
Lynx Witcher|I'm no cheap prick like those hayseeds. I owe you something. Here, directions to my stash. Take what you want.
Geralt|Thanks.
Lynx Witcher|No, thank you. Good luck on the Path, wolf.
Geralt|Stand and fight.
Lynx Witcher|Ah, wow… So that chat - what the hell was the point?
Geralt|I give folk a chance to defend themselves. Unlike you.
Lynx Witcher|Hm, awful chivalrous. A regular defender of the downtrodden… so, mind if I have a dose of Swallow?
Lynx Witcher|C'mon, I'm injured. It'll even the odds a bit.
Geralt|Fine. Drink.
Lynx Witcher|Hah, much appreciated. Behold, a witcher with honor…
Lynx Witcher|And no brains.
Geralt|From what I saw, uneven odds're what you like.
Lynx Witcher|Yeah. But only when they're in my favor.
Geralt|Sorry, not this time. Draw your sword.
Geralt|Ultimately, it's not my job to judge you.
Geralt|The girl - why'd you spare her?
Lynx Witcher|Cause-- Ah, it doesn't matter.
Geralt|Wouldn't have asked if it didn't. Talk.
Lynx Witcher|Reminded me of my sister - how I remember her from… just before they took me away to the School of the Cat.
Geralt|How is she now?
Lynx Witcher|Died about ten years ago. Of old age.
Lynx Witcher|Well, we've had our little heart-to-heart, witcher to witcher. What now?
Geralt|How the hell did you survive that? Pitchfork wounds're bad - know that all too well.
Lynx Witcher|I turned at the last instant. Prongs went in shallow, at an angle. Missed my lungs.
Geralt|Fifty.
Geralt|Not in the mood for guessing games.
Lynx Witcher|Hah. Knew you were no fun the minute I saw you…
Geralt|You lost something.
Lynx Witcher|Come all that way to give me my medallion? Thanks. Craft solidarity's alive and well.
Geralt|Huh. But our craft's reputation is on its last legs. Folk won't easily forget that massacre.
Lynx Witcher|Occupational hazard. Could've happened to any one of us.
Lynx Witcher|Well? What're you still doin' here?
Geralt|I wanna chat first. Then we'll see.
Lynx Witcher|Take a seat.
Geralt|I'll stand.
Geralt|Now talk. Honorton - what happened?
Lynx Witcher|Come on. You know what happened.
Lynx Witcher|Know what they wanted to pay me for the leshen? Go on, guess.
Geralt|You won't leave here alive. Not after what you did.
Lynx Witcher|Uhh… don't I even get a chance to explain?
Geralt|This isn't a trial. Stand up.
Lynx Witcher|A fellow witcher? Well, well, small world.
Lynx Witcher|Well, well, what have we here? Feline armor, wolf's head medallion - a crossbreed?
<|endoftext|>
Verden Girl 02|You're back! I thought… thought you'd not return! That he'd hurt you, too!
Geralt|I'm fine.
Geralt|And you don't need to worry about him anymore.
Verden Girl 02|So… so you'll take me to my auntie's? It's… it's awful here.
Geralt|Sure thing. Let's go.
Verden Girl 02|Think… think I could ride on your shoulders?
Geralt|Hm. So long as you promise not to pull my hair.
Verden Girl 02|I promise!
Geralt|Then hop on up.
Geralt|I will, but not yet. Wait here just a bit longer.
Geralt|And he won't hurt anyone ever again.
Verden Girl 02|Auntie! Auntie Lucy!
Verden Old Woman 02|Millie? What're you doin' here, you naughty girl?!
Verden Girl 02|I… 'cause… back in the village… there's no--
Geralt|I'll explain. You run along and play a bit, all right?
Geralt|There was a massacre in Honorton. No survivors - well… except her.
Verden Old Woman 02|Gods… What happened? A bandit attack?
Geralt|You could say that.
Geralt|You'll look after her?
Verden Old Woman 02|Truth be told… you'd do better to take her with you.
Geralt|Funny. Used to be folk were afraid we'd take their kids.
Verden Old Woman 02|Used to be folk weren't so in need.
Verden Old Woman 02|Got four of me own grandkids. Used to be six… but we buried two last winter.
Verden Old Woman 02|Hard to live off naught but bark soup.
Geralt|Take this. Use it for food - and only food. If I come back and see you drinking…
Verden Old Woman 02|So much? The gods reward ye, master witcher! A thousand blessings!
Geralt|Time I was on my way.
Verden Girl 02|Now? But… but why?
Geralt|Witcher's lot in life - always on the road, on the Path.
Verden Girl 02|Will ye comeback and see me sometime?
Geralt|Hope so. Take care, kid.
Verden Old Woman 02|Millie! Drop that doll and grab the broom! There's work to be done!
Verden Old Woman 02|Millie! Come, child, we'll buy a bit o' flour. Your aunt'll whip up some pancakes. Sound good to ye?
Geralt|Times're tough.
Verden Old Woman 02|Agh, what do you know about it? Begone, already.
Geralt|What? You call me a murderer, then wanna entrust a child to me?
Verden Old Woman 02|Ye shan't lead her round with an empty belly, there's that.
Geralt|No. A… another witcher did it. Villagers provoked him.
Verden Old Woman 02|They speak true of you lot. Heartless and cruel, murderers all.
Geralt|Not all.
Geralt|He's received the ultimate punishment. Enough said.
Verden Old Woman 02|What of it? Ye think that settles things? That folk'll forget?
Geralt|No, they won't forget. They'll continue to fear us, hate us. I've grown accustomed.
Geralt|Doesn't matter. Didn't come here to make peace.
Geralt|A monster killed them. A leshen. They'd posted a contract… but I arrived too late.
Verden Old Woman 02|Twas a lovely village… Good folk lived there, good and true. Ahh, 'tis tragic! Tragic indeed!
Verden Girl 02|It's me, Millie! Remember me?
Geralt|Course I do.
Verden Girl 02|I… I've a gift for ye. 'Cause mummy always said if someone's nice, ye gotta thank 'em!
Geralt|If only more people believed that.
Verden Girl 02|I best be goin'. Auntie says I'm not to stray far from home.
Geralt|Wise words. Be careful… and thanks for the gift.
Verden Girl 02|Hey! Wait! I've somethin' for you!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Must be Honorton, village from the notice. Except… it's awful quiet.
Geralt|Necrophages. Great.
Geralt|Quiet here… and it stinks of carrion. Not good.
Geralt|Not a living soul in sight. Something evil's been here. Necrophages appeared after.
Geralt|Necrophages tore the body apart. Can't say what killed him, though.
Geralt|Hut wasn't looted. Can rule out robbery as a motive.
Geralt|Fire's still burning. This happened recently.
Geralt|Somebody's well-off. Especially for Velen.
Geralt|A leshen's head. Chopped off with a sharp knife.
Geralt|Well, well… somebody beat me to it.
Geralt|Nice work. Must be an expert.
Geralt|Cuts. Shallow… but each hit an artery.
Geralt|Blade pierced her back, between vertebrae. Severed her spinal cord.
Geralt|She couldn't move. Bled to death.
Geralt|Arm severed above the elbow. With one blow.
Geralt|Blood… mixed with something. That smell… alcohol, earthball and wolfsbane. A potion.
Geralt|This blood didn't come from a peasant.
Geralt|Pitchfork. Dangerous weapon at close quarters.
Geralt|First cut severed the aorta. Second hit the femoral artery. He died quickly, didn't put up a fight.
Geralt|Dammit. Must've been a witcher. Killed the leshen… then the villagers.
Geralt|That was his medallion chain in the barn. Might've lost something else there. Should look around.
Geralt|Bolt… snapped in half.
Geralt|Aha - gotcha.
Geralt|Don't worry. I'm not going to hurt you.
Geralt|If he went off towards the circle, that'd be the place to start.
Geralt|Palm print… in blood. Had his hand on his wound. Slipped and leaned on his hand to catch his balance.
Geralt|Footprints. Barely visible. Must be him.
Geralt|Blood… still fresh. He's close.
Geralt|Foglet, ghoul, grave hag… Wonder why he didn't turn in these trophies. Maybe they tried to cheat him then, too.
Geralt|Must be the hideout. Let's see what School of the Cat witchers stash away.
Geralt|Sword wounds.
Geralt|Perfect strike. Died before he hit the ground.
Geralt|These must be her tracks.
Geralt|The stone circle. Need to look around.
Geralt|Died without a fight. Butchered.
Geralt|Blade pierced internal organs.
Geralt|Gut sliced open. Probably died defending its owner.
Geralt|A doll… and a child's footprints.
Geralt|In one window, out the other. Smart.
Geralt|A doll. Fabric's saturated with smoke… Same smell's coming from somewhere else.
Geralt|The soil lie light upon you.
Geralt|Should get back to the kid. Before something else sniffs her out.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|You of Clan Brokvar?
Skellige Merchant 01|True and blue, bred and born.
Geralt|Think I found something might belong to you and your kin. Cargo from a longship that wrecked north of Ard Skellig.
Skellige Merchant 01|Ach, the "Hemdall's Wrath," must be. Sailed out to raid the Continent's coast, must be a month, now. Never came back…
Skellige Merchant 01|But listen, you happen across a sword among the wreckage, decorated, ornate? Belonged to the captain. His kin would surely want it back.
Geralt|Saw some barrels, a few reams of fabric and a lot of trash, but no sword.
Skellige Merchant 01|A shame. Must've sunk to the bottom, or else someone got there before you did and took it.
Geralt|Could be.
Geralt|Yeah, I found it. Glad to give it back, provided the finder's fee is fair.
Skellige Merchant 01|Naturally. Wouldn't have it any other way.
Geralt|Thanks.
Geralt|Hurry and you might be able to recover the rest of the cargo.
Skellige Merchant 01|We'll do just that. I've folk to round up, but thanks for bringin' the news to us.
Geralt|Don't mention it. So long.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Old Woman 03|A ghost! We're all gonna die!
Skellige Old Woman 04|Idgit woman! Ever heard a ghost walk so loud, drag its feet? It's a man, flesh and bone. 'Cept what's he seek here?
Geralt|Just exploring the tunnel other side of the hill.
Geralt|Why're you here?
Skellige Old Woman 03|Came here to cut nails.
Geralt|Nails?
Skellige Old Woman 04|Off corpses. Don't ye know? Wraiths use nails to build their cursed longship.
Geralt|So you're hoping you can make 'em run short of materials.
Skellige Old Woman 04|We would if we could get in the crypts. But there's ghosts inside. Would ye tend to them?
Geralt|Fine. I'll see what I can do about the ghosts.
Geralt|Took care of the ghosts. Crypt is safe.
Skellige Old Woman 03|Thank ye for your help, Whitehaired One.
Skellige Old Woman 04|We'll make a sacrifice to Freya in your name.
Geralt|Farewell.
Geralt|Ran into some monsters down there. Already took care of them.
Skellige Old Woman 03|The white-haired one… Who is he, I wonder…
Skellige Old Woman 04|A warrior, plain to see. Just what we need.
Skellige Old Woman 04|Come over 'ere, traveler!
Skellige Old Woman 03|Ye clean just monsters outta crypts, or treasures, too…?
Skellige Old Woman 04|With peepers like that, it's no wonder he wanders the crypts. Sun must plain blind him.
Geralt|What do you need?
Skellige Old Woman 04|Ye aim to enter the crypts?
Geralt|Maybe…
Geralt|Greetings to you.
Skellige Old Woman 04|And to you.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What is it?
Skellige Villager 04|My ship was wrecked against a rocky shore during the last storm. I've lost everything…
Geralt|How'm I supposed to help?
Skellige Villager 04|I haven't even got the coin for the journey home. And with each day's delay I draw closer to bankruptcy!
Geralt|Mhm, might've guessed you'd come around to coin. So, need a loan, or is it just alms you're after?
Skellige Villager 04|I shall pay you back, every last copper, I swear it! You need only call on me at my address in Novigrad.
Geralt|Fine, I'll help you. I visit Novigrad often enough. Might stop by, see how business is going.
Skellige Villager 04|Thank you! You'll find me in the port district. My name's Johann Bohner.
Geralt|See you later, then.
Geralt|Heard a few too many tales like yours to believe yet another.
Skellige Villager 04|To tell you the truth, I'd probably not believe it either. Alas, I must count on the kindness of others.
Skellige Villager 04|Sorry to trouble you, but I really have no choice…
Geralt|Sorry, in a bit of a hurry.
Skellige Villager 04|Gods, foul times we live in. A man can perish by the roadside and no one'll even stop to care…
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Villager 04|Most humbly beg your pardon, but I-I'm in quite a predicament, see. I'm a wandering juggler from occupied Temeria and--
Geralt|Temeria? You sure? Not Novigrad?
Skellige Villager 04|Why-why Novigrad? I come from Maribor and, uh…
Geralt|You're not cut out for this line of work - memory's too short. See, we've met, but you were a respected Novigrad merchant who wanted desperately to get home.
Skellige Villager 04|Oh, but-but I assure you I-- All right, all right, you got me.
Skellige Villager 04|I-I know this all looks bad, but I-I swear, I-I'll pay you back, mate. All of it, with interest! Just… please, don-don't take me to the jarl.
Geralt|Definitely won't get my coin back if I turn you in. But try to cheat me again, and I'll find you. I'll find you and I'll--
Skellige Villager 04|Nay, I ain't lyin'! Besides, you can go to the jarl any time you want.
Geralt|Then I expect to see you later.
Geralt|Think you could fool me a second time? I'm gonna let the jarl decide what to do with you.
Skellige Villager 04|Force me to come with you - go ahead, try!
Geralt|I don't need a jarl to deal with you, you little crook.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Think I have something that was meant for you.
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 02|A letter from me mum? Says here me sis was bringin' it. How'd you come by it?
Geralt|Came across some bodies in the woods, victims of a monster attack. Found this letter on one of the dead, a woman.
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 02|Singa's dead. Argh, told her and mum so many times - come over, live with me! No, they had to stay on Faroe.
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 02|I gotta send someone to fetch her body.
Geralt|I'm sorry.
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 02|Thanks for bringin' word, not every man'd go to the trouble. Here, take this.
Geralt|You don't wanna know…
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 02|Huh? Why in blazes not? You robbed her, killed her, didn't you! And your conscience eats you now!
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 02|I'd not 'ave expected anythin' else from the likes of you. Outta my sight, you flea-bitten mutant!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What's this offer? Got a contract for me?
Skellige Warrior 03|Might do… if you're willin' to partner with me.
Geralt|Usually work alone.
Skellige Warrior 03|Could pay to make an exception this time. It's not everyday you get a chance to work with the most renowned bounty hunter north of the Yaruga - Djenge Frett himself.
Geralt|I'll bite. What's the famous Djenge Frett need a witcher for?
Skellige Warrior 03|I'm guessin' you're a man of the world. Perhaps you've come across the Grossbart brothers in your travels?
Geralt|You hunting them?
Skellige Warrior 03|Aye, quite the rogues, they are. Three of 'em, and every one's got a pack o' rapes and murders under his belt. Even took to grave robbin' lately!
Skellige Warrior 03|Easy to recognize on account o' the yellow caps they wear. Folk see three yellow tops, they flee to their huts. Which don't help much, o' course, 'cause they're also fond of arson.
Geralt|No, haven't met 'em.
Skellige Warrior 03|If you do, tread careful. They're quick to stick a knife in a man's gut - often just by way of greetin'.
Geralt|Doubt they'd try that with a witcher.
Skellige Warrior 03|Ye never know with that lot. Right, well, I head south soon. Haven't looked there yet. Fare ye well. We might meet again someday.
Geralt|Ah, so those were the Grossbart brothers… Well, seems you need to find yourself a new bounty.
Skellige Warrior 03|Cut 'em down already? Nice work. Listen, give ye half the bounty now if ye tell me where to find the bodies.
Geralt|Sure.
Geralt|Hunting outlaws - just not what I do.
Skellige Warrior 03|Think ye can live on slayin' monsters alone? Downright near-sighted of ye, witcher! Strigas are just about extinct, but scoundrels are out there in droves… and multiplyin'.
Geralt|Funny… heard that once already.
Skellige Warrior 03|Yeah? From who?
Geralt|Don't matter. He's dead now.
Skellige Warrior 03|Ye needn't resort to threats. I can take no for an answer.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Warrior 02|Thank ye, White One. You're not one of us, but ye sure fight like an islander. How's it you came to Skellige?
Geralt|Long story. Got something to take care of here.
Skellige Warrior 02|As we all do. Me, for instance, I'm lookin' for me sister.
Geralt|What happened to her?
Skellige Warrior 02|Pirates took her. But I'll get 'em in me grip and squeeze. Regret their mothers ever bore 'em as they shit themselves.
Geralt|Know where to go? Got any clues?
Skellige Warrior 02|These two here, afore they pounced on me, said their captain'd set sail for Hindarsfjall. Kurisu were on board his longboat.
Geralt|Hope you find her.
Skellige Warrior 02|Listen, if… if you come across those pirates or see Kurisu anywhere, tell her to go to Blandare, tell her to go home.
Geralt|Got my word on that. Farewell.
Geralt|I'll be sure to say you're looking for her if I find her. Can't promise anything beyond that.
Skellige Warrior 02|I'd never ask more. Thank ye. So long.
Geralt|If your sister's Kurisu, think I might've run into her. On Hindarsfjall, at Freya's temple.
Skellige Warrior 02|How is she?! Sound, healthy?!
Geralt|She's safe, healthy, at least in body. Priestesses took good care of her.
Skellige Warrior 02|I've gotta go there! I've gotta take her home!
Skellige Warrior 02|Here, take this. And you've me unending gratitude! Thanks, witcher!
Geralt|Here's hoping you find your sister. Farewell.
Skellige Warrior 02|Greetings, White One. Glad to see ye farin' well.
Skellige Warrior 02|Hey, White One! Help!
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Woman 05|Welcome to the Temple of Freya. I'm Kurisu. How can I help?
Geralt|You a novice? 'Cause I'd never take you for a priestess…
Skellige Woman 05|Truly? Hmm, you've got a good eye, though a bit off in this case. I'm neither a priestess nor a novice. I escaped a pirate ship, was wounded - that's why I'm here.
Skellige Woman 05|Sisters Astrid and Dalla found me on the beach, near dead. They brought me to the temple, watched o'er me. I owe them me life.
Geralt|Quite the adventure… Got a home to go back to? Or will you stay here?
Skellige Woman 05|I've a brother on Ard Skellig. He's surely mad with grief, searchin' for me… Once I'm better, all better, I'll find a longship and head home.
Geralt|You were lucky. Very.
Skellige Woman 05|True. Soon as I get back to Blandare, me and me brother'll make an offerin' to Freya. And I thank ye for your help.
Geralt|Take care, now.
Geralt|You're Kurisu?
Skellige Woman 05|Aye.
Geralt|Ran into your brother. He's scouring all Skellige for you.
Skellige Woman 05|Ye know him? Truly? How is he?
Geralt|Fine. Mentioned some pirates had kidnapped you.
Skellige Woman 05|Twas the most horrible night of me life… I remember fire, cries, and the clink of iron 'gainst iron… They herded us on a longship.
Skellige Woman 05|Toward dawn a storm broke. It was mayhem, so I took advantage and jumped overboard.
Geralt|So long.
Skellige Woman 05|Greetings, what brings ye here?
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Warrior 01|Who are ye? Why're ye here?
Geralt|Could ask you the same. Places like this - usually home to necrophages alone.
Skellige Warrior 01|There're corpse-eaters, aye. And they grow bolder by the day, crawl out to attack the livin'!
Skellige Warrior 02|We'll kill 'em all! Clear the mine with our swords in our hands! Honor our fathers in doin' so.
Geralt|I'm a witcher. Could go with you and help.
Skellige Warrior 01|And steal the glory due us?! No chance!
Geralt|Glory won't do much for you if ghouls're gnawing on your bones.
Skellige Warrior 02|Hm… when ye think on it… makes sense.
Skellige Warrior 01|Hmm… All right. You lead the way, then.
Geralt|If you're looking to die, that's your problem. So long.
Geralt|Still here?
Skellige Warrior 02|Ye back? Come to see how we unburden the world o' ghouls?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Geralt of Rivia. I'm a witcher.
Skellige Villager 01|Thanks for your aid. If you'd not come by, we'd 'ave been done for.
Geralt|Lugos'll wonder what happened to his men. What'll you do?
Skellige Villager 01|Don't worry about us. Send my boy off to Kaer Trolde, hasty like. The jarl's not like to let Lugos off. You'd best watch your own back. Lugos finds out, he'll try to get even.
Geralt|Think I'll manage. Good luck.
Geralt|Just a traveler. Happened to be passing through.
Geralt|Who were they?
Skellige Villager 01|Bandits. Madman Lugos' men.
Skellige Villager 01|And who are you, my good man?
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Warrior 04|Ah, there y'are. Don't know about your ways, but here, when ye agree to do business, we don't keep folk waitin'.
Geralt|What business?
Skellige Warrior 04|Oh, drop the secret shite, we've not the time. Nilfgaardian bloke, Ville, said he'd send a body for the goods the day. So in ye go, and just be sure to behave.
Geralt|Fine, I'm going.
Geralt|I look like a Nilfgaardian to you?
Skellige Warrior 04|What the fuck's your problem?
Skellige Warrior 04|Get in there! Ye wanna crack, do it with the boss.
Geralt|Look, I have no idea what you want from me.
Skellige Warrior 04|Then who the fuck are ye? And what the fuck're ye doin' here?
Geralt|Picking flowers.
Skellige Warrior 04|Wise arse, eh? Well ye can sniff them flowers o' yours - from below!
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Bandit 01|Fuck me, powerful stench comin' from the hold.
Skellige Warrior 01|Aye, we're victims of our own success. Best raid ever.
Skellige Bandit 01|Success or no, gotta get those shiteaters out right quick, 'fore the stank settles in permanent-like.
Skellige Bandit 02|Think I could have me a go?
Skellige Warrior 02|Too late now. Got a buyer for the whole lot.
Skellige Bandit 02|No one'll ever know…
Skellige Bandit 03|Uggghhh…
Skellige Warrior 03|What is it?
Skellige Bandit 03|Whoreson bit me clean to the bone.
Skellige Warrior 03|Ye should've put a blade 'tween his ribs, gotten it over with.
Skellige Guard 06|Call that "premium goods"?! Fuckin' jest, that! These folk ain't but skin and bones.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What'd you expect - a big sun on my chest? Would that be Nilfgaardian enough for you?
Skellige Guard 06|Fine, fine, no need to be jumpy. Goods're ready.
Geralt|Don't like to hear humans referred to as "goods."
Skellige Guard 06|I don't give a fuck what ye do or don't like. Got the sum we agreed on?
Geralt|Yeah. Your coin.
Skellige Guard 06|They call you Black Ones whoresons to a man, but me, I like doin' business with yous. At least you don't stall in payin'.
Skellige Guard 06|That leaves transport. We brought 'em here, you gotta take 'em onward. Ye'd do best to sail your ship into the bay.
Geralt|Just give me the key to the cell.
Skellige Guard 06|Then what? Will ye drive 'em on foot? Ye alone?
Geralt|Any who drop, I'll leave behind. Ville only wants the strong.
Skellige Guard 06|Fine, here. Just don't come cryin' for your coin if they run. They're your property now.
Geralt|You're confused. I already paid. Just here for the pick-up.
Skellige Guard 06|Ah, aye, I remember now.
Geralt|I really don't like to hear humans reffered to as "goods." And I'm not a slave trader.
Geralt|Heard you've been waiting for me. How're the goods?
Skellige Guard 06|Had to calm a few of 'em, but we managed it without doin' serious harm. Tough islanders, these, they'll serve you well.
Geralt|Good. Ville doesn't like cock-ups.
Skellige Guard 06|Hm… Sure it were Ville who sent you? Expected someone more… Nilfgaardian.
Geralt|Sorry to disappoint. To be honest, I'm not from Nilfgaard. And I haven't the faintest who Ville is.
Skellige Guard 06|Enemy in the camp! To arms!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Thanks for the information.
Skellige Woman 05|No, I'm the one grateful… for savin' me and the others.
Skellige Woman 04|The trader's come, there's no hope for us.
Skellige Woman 05|Quiet, I know 'im. That's Geralt of Rivia, the witcher. A friend of an Craite's. Jarl must've sent 'im to rescue us!
Skellige Woman 04|Thank ye, witcher! Don't know what would've become of us without ye!
Skellige Woman 05|Wait, 'fore you go - that boss, he had a chest in his room, elegant like, cloth covered. I'd bet me right foot he didn't keep spare socks in it.
Skellige Woman 05|Thank ye, witcher, thank ye once more!
Geralt|You're mine now. All of you. Now listen and obey. Anyone doesn't, gets cut down like a dog, understood?
Geralt|Follow me.
Geralt|You're free. Go west, you'll reach a village.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What happened?
Skellige Fisherman 01|What happened, dammit, is that I fell and cracked me damn leg in two!
Skellige Villager 01|Stop whinin', Petter, I'm ashamed to hear it. Pull yourself together, man.
Skellige Villager 01|Worst case, Henrik'll whittle ye a wooden leg. Old Olle's got one and ye don't hear him complainin'.
Skellige Fisherman 01|Old Olle's also got lice, stinks and leaks out both ends, yet he don't complain 'bout that either. You two gonna help or no?
Geralt|How'd you fall?
Skellige Fisherman 01|We set out to light a fire there, atop the statue's shoulders. For our own glory and that of our ancestors.
Geralt|Looks like you succeeded.
Skellige Villager 01|Aye, but the fire whoomped big so quick Petter jumped back, lost his balance…
Geralt|Got lucky anyway. Could've broken his neck falling from that height.
Geralt|This celandine should help you. Won't mend your leg, but it will make it hurt less.
Skellige Villager 01|Thanks, our undyin' gratitude that gets ye!
Skellige Fisherman 01|The gratitude of a dyin' man, in my case. Enjoy it while it lasts.
Skellige Villager 01|Shut it and show me that leg!
Skellige Villager 01|Thanks again. Gods guide ye.
Geralt|Celandine would dull the pain.
Skellige Villager 01|Know where it grows? I'd go meself, but I'm unwillin' to leave Petter alone.
Geralt|Pretty common herb. Must be a bush around here. I'll get you some.
Skellige Villager 01|Thanks.
Geralt|Common herb, you shouldn't have to look far. I don't have time.
Skellige Villager 01|Oh, right, forgot, a man in need can only rely on hisself.
Geralt|This statue - what is it?
Skellige Villager 01|An altar to the god of warriors.
Skellige Villager 01|Any man who dares climb it and light the fire gains the favor of the gods, fame and--
Skellige Fisherman 01|And an excellent chance of snappin' his leg off at the arse.
Skellige Fisherman 01|You lot gonna help me or continue preachin'?
Geralt|Love to help, but a medic's what you need.
Skellige Villager 01|Tough… I'll get him to the village somehow, find a druid.
Skellige Fisherman 01|A druid? No chance! I don't trust any man who ploughin' lives on roots and leaves!
Skellige Villager 01|You'll have to make an exception or ye really will lose that leg.
Geralt|Need a medic or a druid, not a witcher. Farewell.
Geralt|How do you feel?
Skellige Fisherman 01|Same as before. Owww!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Druids aren't any good with wraiths…
Skellige Villager 02|Oh? Suppose you're better?
Skellige Villager 04|Shut your gob, he's better than any. That's a witcher, there.
Skellige Villager 04|Listen - it's our arena, got a wraith that haunts it. Damned if we know how to drive it off. Think you could manage?
Geralt|Wraith's gone. You can start organizing fights again.
Skellige Villager 02|What? Easy as that…?
Geralt|Nothing's ever easy with specters.
Skellige Villager 04|Aye, I believe it took effort… And effort deserves compensation.
Geralt|Ghost shouldn't pester you anymore. Drinking mead with his ancestors by now.
Skellige Villager 04|Hah! Knew you'd manage it! Well, Gunnar, me winnings…
Skellige Villager 02|Here…
Geralt|You bet on it?
Skellige Villager 04|Shoulda seen it! I said you'd pull it off, Gunnar said there weren't a chance. It's why he's got that sheep's arse frown now.
Geralt|See that frown often - when it's time for me to get paid.
Skellige Villager 02|You needn't fret, we're honorable folk here. This is for you.
Skellige Villager 04|And remember - you get a cut o' the earnin's once we get the arena up and runnin' again.
Geralt|I'll remember that. So long.
Geralt|This wraith - I can probably manage it. Need the details.
Skellige Villager 04|What do you wanna know?
Geralt|All right, could try my hand at driving away this specter… Not for free, though.
Skellige Villager 02|Get it done, and we'll pay you the champion's purse!
Skellige Villager 04|And a premium from our earnin's to come, once the fightin' begins after the curse is lifted!
Skellige Villager 02|Oh! Sure you're not gettin' carried away there…?
Skellige Villager 04|A little, aye… but fuck it! Witcher gets rid o' the wraith, he'll deserve a premium from the earnin's, he will!
Skellige Villager 02|So be it… One time only, though.
Geralt|Sounds reasonable. Wait for me here - shouldn't be too long.
Geralt|Sorry, not interested. So long.
Skellige Villager 02|But unclean powers haunt the place, an accursed ghost!
Geralt|So don't go in there.
Skellige Villager 04|Aww, you can shove that advice up yer arse.
Skellige Villager 02|But if ye change your mind, a reward awaits.
Geralt|Business is booming, far as I can see…
Skellige Villager 02|Better believe it! Every man and his hound wants to fight in the Cursed Arena!
Geralt|My cut of the proceeds must've grown sizeable…
Skellige Villager 04|And how! Here.
Geralt|Always a pleasure doing business in Skellige.
Skellige Villager 02|Greetin's.
Geralt|Know anything about this specter? When'd it first appear?
Skellige Villager 04|Me grandda told me his grandda said the wraith was called Ulle the Unlucky. Lost every bout he entered, yet always recovered from his wounds. Ulle weren't even able to die like a man!
Skellige Villager 02|Till one day Jarl Thormar called a tournament in the arena. In those days they drew lots to choose their foes, and the jarl drew Ulle the Unlucky.
Skellige Villager 02|Jarl was cock sure he'd win, so he mocked Ulle, ridiculed him till all in the stands were cryin' with laughter. Finally, he raised his arms in triumph. And that's when Ulle, who couldn't take it no more, stuck a dagger in his back.
Skellige Villager 04|As he died, Thormar cursed Ulle: "May ye lose again and again, for centuries on end." That's what he said. Ever since, Ulle's haunted the arena, lookin' for a fight, and gettin' a few.
Geralt|Mean there've been those who've tried to defeat him?
Skellige Villager 04|You kiddin'? Everyone's beaten 'im! Poor bugger keeps comin' back, though. Can't organize no normal fights precisely 'cause o' that.
Geralt|What kind of an arena is this?
Skellige Villager 04|It's an arena, like any other.
Skellige Villager 02|The custom was for the best warriors to clash here. Spikeroog bouts were famous all across Skellige!
Geralt|Then one day a wraith showed up…
Skellige Villager 02|How did ye know?
Skellige Villager 04|Told ye, he's a witcher, a cunning man. He knows these things!
Skellige Villager 02|Oh, witcher. Changed your mind, have ye?
Skellige Villager 04|Come again, eh?! Great things're bound to happen 'ere. Mark my words!
Geralt|I hope they do. Good luck.
Geralt|Thanks. So long.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Warrior 01|Come to face the Ghost of the Arena? Don't be shy - all defeat Ulle the Unlucky.
Skellige Warrior 01|Just spare me your jabber, your cries of "Die, wraith!" and "I shall defeat ye, Specter o' the Arena!" I've heard 'em all a thousand times. Dreadful sick of 'em.
Geralt|Draw your weapon.
Skellige Warrior 01|Drawin', drawin'. But make it quick. And not too much drama, if ye don't mind.
Geralt|You're no typical wraith…
Skellige Warrior 01|Why not? 'Cause I don't shriek threats and warn ye of your death? Well, that's simple enough - plain bored o' that.
Skellige Warrior 01|Sides, I know how it'll be: you'll spit out some insults, pierce me with your sword. I'll then disappear, only to be back again in a few days.
Skellige Warrior 01|And it'll be so with those who come after ye. Such is me fate - I'm to tarry here till the world's end, losin' every fight along the way.
Skellige Warrior 01|But you've not come to chat. Draw it, swing it, get to work and defeat the Ghost of the Arena.
Geralt|Not gonna be any fight.
Skellige Warrior 01|Have it your way. If not you, then the one to come after. 'Tis all the same to me.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Mind if I interrupt?
Skellige Villager 06|Nay. My prayers're in vain anyways…
Geralt|Hear you're having trouble with a curse?
Skellige Villager 06|Aye, I am. Look, see it lyin' there, the horse head on the pole? That's--
Geralt|A Nithing. Kind of curse. Seen this before. They're nothing to scoff at - can bring misfortune, even death.
Skellige Villager 06|Aye! And the name carved upon it is Tjalve, my first-born. Boy's feverish, grows weaker by the day. I fear I'll bury 'im before the next moon. Tried to lift the curse myself but… no luck.
Geralt|I can help you - one of two ways.
Geralt|First - I can try to convince whoever put up the Nithing to lift the curse themselves. Second - I can deflect the curse back on whoever cast it by writing their name on the shaft. Either way, need to know who's behind this.
Skellige Villager 06|But… I don't trouble no one. Don't know a soul who'd wish it upon me.
Geralt|Mhm. Guess I gotta investigate…
Geralt|Heard you're a man with troubles…
Geralt|I'm sorry… Farewell.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Found your shawl, near Lothar's house… by the Nithing you put up there.
Skellige Woman 05|How did you know?
Geralt|Had a hunch… thanks for confirming it. You know Tjalve's got one foot in the grave?
Skellige Woman 05|Good. That bastard should never have been born.
Skellige Woman 05|Me, I was to be Lothar's bride! But he cast me aside for that flounder. Gettin' his comeuppance, now. Him and that whole ploughin' family.
Geralt|Want you to lift the curse. I mean it.
Skellige Woman 05|Fine, I'll do it, but I've my terms. Lothar's to renounce his son and come back to me.
Geralt|I'll be sure to tell him… But I think we both know what his answer'll be.
Geralt|You'd kill a child out of jealousy? Are you serious?
Skellige Woman 05|Tis not jealousy but dignity that matters here. Ten years we lived side by side. Ten years! I cooked for 'im, washed his breeches, shared me bed… And he abandoned me with nary a word!
Skellige Woman 05|Whole village laughed… "Stupid bint Jonna, let herself be had!" Oh no - I've not been had, nor have I forgot.
Skellige Woman 05|What do you want?
Geralt|Never mind. Farewell.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Villager 06|So? You know who placed the Nithing?
Geralt|Old friend of yours… Jonna.
Skellige Villager 06|I might've guessed. Jealous bitch, can't stand to see others happy! So? Will she lift the curse?
Geralt|Yeah, sure. All you gotta do is renounce your family and go back to her.
Skellige Villager 06|Nay. Never! My wife, my son - I'd strip them of honor, condemn them to poverty! You've gotta break the spell, witcher! Let her die!
Geralt|Can't do that. Jonna doesn't deserve it.
Skellige Villager 06|And my son?! Does he?!
Geralt|No. But he doesn't have to die. You have a choice.
Skellige Villager 06|All right! If it'll save Tjalve, I'll go back to the hussy. And you… best not see your face round here again.
Geralt|You might deserve to be punished… but not this way. Fine. I'll do it.
Skellige Villager 06|Thanks be to the gods!
Geralt|Don't bring the gods into it. This is between two human beings.
Geralt|We'll talk later.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Druid 05|But I only wish to pray, pay homage to the gods.
Skellige Bandit 03|You wanna pass, you gotta pay. Can't let you through elsewise.
Skellige Druid 05|Have you no conscience?! The gods will punish you!
Geralt|Let him through. No sweat off your back, no harm done.
Skellige Bandit 01|Perhaps, but then 'tain't no help to us, neither. Besides, why do you care? You his nanny or somethin'?
Geralt|Let him pass. I'll pay his toll.
Skellige Bandit 01|Hah! Knew it! It's his nanny! Seemed a warrior for a bit… Now, why's a bleedin' nanny wear swords across his back?
Geralt|Want me to show you? I can still change my mind.
Skellige Bandit 03|Calm now, no need. Coin's there, so let him through. And who's payin' for who - that's no concern of ours.
Geralt|No. I'm someone who has weapons and knows how to use them.
Skellige Bandit 01|Hear that, lads?! He's threatenin' us!
Skellige Bandit 03|Let's see if his swords're as sharp as his tongue.
Geralt|This is none of my concern. Won't interfere.
Skellige Bandit 03|As well you shouldn't! On your way, now!
Skellige Bandit 01|That's him! The one killed Sigrun!
Skellige Bandit 03|Whoreson! It's come time to answer for that!
Skellige Bandit 03|You again?! Get outta here!
Skellige Bandit 01|Won't pay us in gold, pay us in blood!
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Druid 05|Thank you, wanderer. I shall say a prayer for you at my pilgrimage's end.
Geralt|Nice gesture, thanks… Now, where's your pilgrimage taking you?
Skellige Druid 05|To the Four Faces of Hemdall, raised in honor of our great hero.
Geralt|I've heard the legends of Hemdall… A great warrior and first father of the Isles.
Skellige Druid 05|Tis true, and before the advent of Tedd Deireadh, the Final Age, he shall return, walk amidst us, and face the evil powers, demons and specters of Chaos.
Skellige Druid 05|The golden cockerel Kambi will crow to warn Hemdall of the coming of the Naglfar, bringing the army of darkness. A battle will ensue - Ragh nar Roog - and Hemdall will clash with the forces of the dark.
Geralt|Let's hope he wins…
Skellige Druid 05|It'll make no difference. The prophecy is clear - after Ragh nar Roog, the world will end.
Geralt|Prophecies can be tricky that way. And there's never an ending that's not also a new beginning, a fresh start.
Skellige Druid 05|Let us hope you're right, wanderer, let us hope you're right.
Geralt|So long. And stay out of trouble.
Skellige Druid 05|Greetings, wanderer. You're safe and sound, that's good to see.
Geralt|Hello. Still on your pilgrimage?
Skellige Druid 05|Indeed. And by each of Hemdall's faces I pray the gods grant you grace.
Skellige Druid 05|Thank you, thank you for your help. Hemdall reward your sacrifice.
Skellige Druid 05|Gods be with you, wanderer.
Skellige Druid 05|Why? Wherein lies my crime?
Skellige Druid 05|I merely want to prey, pay tribute to the gods. These scoundrels won't let me pass!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Got some bad news… Sadly, Agda's dead. So are your brothers…
Skellige Villager 01|Wh… what? How? What're you sayin'?
Geralt|A storm destroyed their boat - Agda was killed. Your brothers felt they'd let you down, couldn't live with the shame… They chose death.
Geralt|Found this letter. Might help you come to terms…
Skellige Villager 01|A letter? That all that's left of 'em?!
Geralt|Sorry, didn't find anything else.
Geralt|Also found your fiancé's dowry. Small comfort, but still…
Skellige Villager 01|Thanks. Few men would be so honorable. Fare ye well.
Skellige Villager 01|I've nothin' left in this life…
Geralt|What's the matter?
Skellige Villager 01|Me betrothed and me brothers… Mikkel and Ulf sailed to Hindarsfjall. To fetch Agda, wedding's in but a few days. But they've yet to return.
Skellige Villager 01|A storm broke while they were gone. I fear it might've blown 'em onto the rocks at Faroe. Many've lost their lives there.
Skellige Villager 01|I'd sail out to find them, I would, but I've got to make sure the wedding's proper prepared.
Skellige Villager 01|They say it's not fittin' for a Skelliger to ask for aid, but I've no choice - will ye help me? Will ye seek out me kin?
Geralt|Fine, I'll look around for them.
Geralt|We've all got problems, I'm no exception. Sorry, can't help you.
Skellige Villager 01|I understand, should never 'ave bothered ye. I'll go meself.
Geralt|What about the wedding preparations?
Skellige Villager 01|Won't be any weddin' if I don't bring Agda here. I should go.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Woman 04|I've not seen you here before. What do they call you?
Geralt|Geralt of Rivia.
Skellige Woman 04|I'm Jutta an Dimun. No man's been found who could best me in combat.
Geralt|Will you fight me?
Skellige Woman 04|You? I've defeated Faroe's most famous warriors, men so worthy of respect I don't dare mention their names. And who is Geralt of Rivia?
Geralt|Someone you haven't defeated.
Skellige Woman 04|Maybe you're not worthy of my time. You performed any great feats? 'Cause I don't believe I've heard…
Geralt|What kind of feats you have in mind?
Skellige Woman 04|I've heard of you. 'Twas you defeated Olaf the Bear, right?
Geralt|That's me.
Skellige Woman 04|If that's so, you'll make a worthy opponent.
Geralt|Ready when you are.
Skellige Woman 04|Then let's start. May Freya choose the victor.
Geralt|Gladly fight you, but some other time.
Skellige Woman 04|Don't know if you lack honor or knowledge of our customs, but you'll not fight me now or ever. You're no longer worthy…
Geralt|But…
Skellige Woman 04|Out of my sight.
Skellige Woman 04|I've heard of you. Word is you defeated Kolgrim and his men. They say the ground couldn't soak up the blood fast enough.
Geralt|Just kinda turned out that way.
Skellige Woman 04|Modesty's a quality fit for priestesses and young lasses, not warriors. But I'll fight you nonetheless.
Geralt|I defeated Gundar.
Skellige Woman 04|Hm, thought you'd be no match for him. All right, we'll see how you fare against me.
Geralt|Got Hoskuld's sword like you wanted. Have yet to check if it really can't be chipped.
Skellige Woman 04|Well, well… How'd you manage it?
Geralt|Didn't take much. Just a bit of holding my breath and swinging my arms and legs at the same time.
Skellige Woman 04|Hm, strong in the mouth. Let's see if you're as cocky in the ring.
Skellige Woman 04|Greetings, White One.
Skellige Woman 04|If I'm to fight a witcher, I could use a fitting sword. At the sea's bottom, not far from shore, lies the wreck of Horned Hoskuld's longship…
Skellige Woman 04|…And amidst the wreck lies Hoskuld's sword, which legend claims cannot be chipped. Bring it to me, and I'll fight you.
Skellige Woman 04|Hm… I'll fight you… if you defeat Gundar. Couldn't best me, but he's a brave man and a worthy opponent.
Geralt|Good, I'll give it a shot. See you soon.
Skellige Woman 04|I truly wonder if you will. Farewell!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|You Gundar?
Skellige Guard 03|Aye.
Geralt|I want to fight you.
Skellige Guard 03|Why me, exactly? Askin' outta curiosity, given you're a foreigner.
Geralt|All right. Jutta said she'd fight me if I defeated you.
Skellige Guard 03|Jutta said that?! Means that if I win, she'll give me another chance!
Skellige Guard 03|Well, come on, then. Let's do this!
Skellige Guard 03|You step outside the ring, you lose - got it?
Geralt|Heard you fought Jutta.
Skellige Guard 03|And she bested me. But there's no dishonor in losin' to her. Though it is a shame…
Geralt|Why?
Skellige Guard 03|Twere a fair fight, one worth rememberin'. But if I'd won, I could've presented her an altogether different sort of challenge.
Geralt|Hm, seemed a little unapproachable to me…
Skellige Guard 03|Heheeh. She awaits a man she can't defeat. In fact, she's declared that only a man who beats her can hope to woo her.
Geralt|Interesting way to look for a husband.
Skellige Guard 03|I'm not sure it's marriage she's after.
Skellige Guard 03|Argh, a lass like that's one in ten thousand!
Geralt|So long.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Woman 04|Enough! Enough! Oh, gods…
Geralt|Not surprised you have a hard time finding worthy opponents.
Skellige Woman 04|In the end… one came along… Where'd you learn all that?
Geralt|At Kaer Morhen.
Skellige Woman 04|Kaer Morhen! That's terribly far. But you learned a great deal on the road as well, surely. Would you tell me about it?
Geralt|It'd make for a long story.
Skellige Woman 04|All right, we need a quiet spot, some good mead and… What do you say?
Geralt|Gladly. See you at the inn?
Skellige Woman 04|Too rowdy. Come to my home, in Harviken. I'll be waiting after dusk.
Geralt|See you later, then.
Geralt|Some other time, maybe.
Skellige Woman 04|Hm. Must admit that was not the answer I expected. Thought you'd want to celebrate your victory.
Skellige Woman 04|Though, of course, I understand you might be in a rush. Good luck on the Path.
Geralt|You've probably never heard of the place.
Skellige Woman 04|You'd be surprised. But you needn't tell me if you don't want to.
Geralt|It's no secret, actually.
Skellige Woman 04|In that case, will you tell me later? Over mead, somewhere cozy?
Skellige Woman 04|So? Had enough?
Geralt|Yes.
Skellige Woman 04|Ugh… I thought I'd finally found a man who could best me.
Geralt|Shouldn't 'ave fought so hard…
Skellige Woman 04|You know nothing, White One. Now go.
Skellige Woman 04|Foul! Fraud! Magic and potions to defeat one woman?
Geralt|But…
Skellige Woman 04|For shame!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Greetings.
Skellige Woman 04|I'd started to think you'd changed your mind.
Geralt|I'd never miss a chance to spend a pleasant evening with you.
Skellige Woman 04|I don't know that I'll make for engaging company. In truth, I rarely talk to men.
Geralt|We don't have to talk.
Skellige Woman 04|Well, well. And here I thought Freya'd played a trick on me: I swore before her I'd only marry a man who could defeat me in combat.
Skellige Woman 04|And she sent me a witcher… Cruel irony, wouldn't you say?
Geralt|Are you terribly disappointed?
Skellige Woman 04|No. 'Cause I see that we understand each other perfectly.
Geralt|Rarely? Why?
Skellige Woman 04|Well, I don't like to waste time chattin' before fights, and after them I've none left to talk to.
Skellige Woman 04|And now that I've finally met someone stronger, seems Freya's played a cruel trick on me.
Geralt|What's Freya got to do with it?
Skellige Woman 04|I swore to the goddess that only he who bested me in battle would lie with me, take me as his wife and give me children.
Geralt|Can't really help you with the second and the third…
Geralt|But I'm sure I can think of something to satisfy the first.
Skellige Woman 04|Exactly what I'd hoped for.
Geralt|Wrong guy beat you, unfortunately.
Skellige Woman 04|Yes, I know witchers aren't husband material, nor can they sire children. But it was you who bested me.
Geralt|And I'm sure many warriors in Skellige are worthier of your attention than I am.
Skellige Woman 04|One would be enough.
Geralt|Never thought of searching the other isles?
Skellige Woman 04|Hm, you could be right. I believe it may be time to leave Faroe.
Geralt|Well, good luck, Jutta an Dimun.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Druid 05|A witcher? Oi! Step over here!
Geralt|Heard you calling.
Skellige Druid 05|Aye, 'cause I was. I thank Mother Nature she didn't skimp on my voice, as she did with some others I know…
Skellige Druid 05|See, one of us, Egill, went mute all of a sudden. No spell or potion helps him. But it is said strong emotions and experiences can restore speech. So, I thought perhaps you might… I'll pay you, of course! Give you an e-excellent gwent card!
Geralt|Suppose I could try… But I wouldn't even know where to start. You want me to... scare him?
Skellige Druid 05|Aye, good, good! That should do it! Scare, irritate… whatever you wish, provided you do him no harm. You can usually find Egill near the hallowed oak. Poor man, he's probably praying in his heart for a cure.
Geralt|Sorry. Just not one of the services I offer.
Skellige Druid 03|What harm was my vow to you anyway?!
Skellige Druid 05|I had no one to talk to! Am I to go to Gremist each time I wish to chat?
Skellige Druid 05|Oh! C'mere, witcher! Egill's got something to say!
Skellige Druid 03|Aye! That you're a cruel and malicious old buffer!
Skellige Druid 05|Hah! Heard him screaming clear over here! Grand work, witcher! Your reward, as promised.
Geralt|Don't like being played for a fool. Remember that… or next time you'll be the one left speechless.
Geralt|How about that. Beard down to his waist… and a toddler's sense of humor. Good luck to you.
Skellige Druid 05|So, witcher? Will you help Egill?
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Druid 03|Piss off, already, you--! Oh, nay… I-I… My vow of silence! All for naught.
Skellige Druid 03|Three years! Three years and not a word, not a peep! Until today. You made me break my vow. Happy?!
Geralt|I meant well, really…
Skellige Druid 03|Well it certainly didn't turn out well! Out of my sight, swine!
Geralt|Oh, sorry. Someone tricked me. I thought--
Skellige Druid 03|Boo hoo hoo! My deepest sympathies! Now get out of my sight, you imbecile!
Geralt|Are you the silent druid?
Skellige Druid 03|…
Geralt|Oh, yeah. Dumb question.
Skellige Druid 03|…
Geralt|They ever try to cure you some other way? Give you potions or herbs?
Skellige Druid 03|…
Geralt|Not just mute. Seems he's deaf, too…
Geralt|When'd you lose your voice? Can you show me, hold up some fingers?
Geralt|Ah, charming man.
Geralt|Hm, doesn't look like we'll figure much out talking. So long.
Geralt|Talking won't get me anywhere…
Skellige Druid 03|…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Definitely not for those unlucky enough to land here. You Gunnar?
Skellige Warrior 01|Who's askin' and why?
Geralt|I wanna travel the Path of Warriors.
Skellige Warrior 01|No outlander's ever dared… But if you've had your fill of life… Go on, try.
Geralt|What do I do?
Skellige Warrior 01|Path's got two offshoots. One leads into mountain peaks, the other into the bowels o' the earth. Traverse both, and you'll 'ave proved your valor.
Geralt|Well, I'm not scared to try.
Skellige Warrior 01|Not just foreign, but dumb, too. Well, no curin' that.
Skellige Warrior 01|Well, run to the top of Mount Aardeklove, grab the crimson shawl. Then reach the cave. At its end ye'll find somethin' I'm not about to describe.
Skellige Warrior 01|On you go, then. Show the world what you're worth.
Geralt|Tell me about the mountain path.
Skellige Warrior 01|It leads along the crest of Mount Aardeklove. You'll find a crimson shawl at the peak. Bring that back as proof you've reached the path's end.
Geralt|Doesn't sound like much of a challenge…
Skellige Warrior 01|Clear you've not spent much time in our mountains.
Geralt|Can you tell me more about the underground path… this a cave of some sort?
Skellige Warrior 01|Aye, but the corridors leadin' to it are flooded. No Continental's ever managed to swim them. Takes trainin' since youth, a lot of divin' after pearls.
Geralt|We'll see about that. What else?
Skellige Warrior 01|At the cavern's end a surprise awaits. Take what ye find there, bring it to me.
Geralt|A surprise? What kind?
Skellige Warrior 01|You'll see… so long as ye get to the end. So long as the harpies don't get ye.
Geralt|Might give your path a try some day… Not today, though. So long.
Skellige Warrior 01|First you've gotta run the Warrior's Trail along the mountain's ridge. At the summit ye'll find a crimson shawl. That is, you'll find it if you make it there.
Geralt|Second part of the trial - what's it entail?
Skellige Warrior 01|Second part's harder still. Ye'll enter a flooded cavern, have to swim its passages, all beneath water. Only men of these isles're capable of the feat.
Skellige Warrior 01|You again? Thought you'd wised up.
Geralt|Thought wrong.
Geralt|What do I do to complete the Path of Warriors? Remind me.
Skellige Warrior 01|Eager to walk the Path, but don't remember what he's to do. Heh.
Skellige Warrior 01|Climb to the top of Mount Aardeklove, retrieve the crimson shawl. Then reach the cavern at whose end you'll find somethin' I will not describe.
Skellige Warrior 01|Bring me that… with the shawl.
Geralt|Times've changed.
Skellige Warrior 01|Begone from here. You tread upon the Path of Warriors.
Geralt|Just so happens that's exactly what interests me. What is it?
Skellige Warrior 01|It is the road young An Skelligers follow into the world of grown warriors.
Geralt|Like to give it a try.
Skellige Warrior 01|You're neither young nor an An Skelliger, but if you want to learn the true meaning of bravery… go right ahead.
Geralt|I don't know you, you don't know me… So what's your problem?
Skellige Warrior 01|These Isles were ours alone once. No foreigner dared set foot here. And if they did, they'd not return home. The good days, those…

Skellige Boatbuilder 02|Free me, I beg o' ye.
Geralt|Why'd they chain you here?
Skellige Boatbuilder 02|I didn't like ol' Gretter, no, but I didn't want his death. Free me, please. I was framed for murder.
Geralt|Hmm… Guess I believe you…
Skellige Boatbuilder 02|Thanks. I won't forget this. I've no way to pay ye, but… We ever meet again, I'll get you back for what you done.
Geralt|Can you walk?
Skellige Boatbuilder 02|Don't fret about me. I just need to rest a spell, then I'll be fine. Thank you for your help.
Geralt|Yeah… All prisoners make that claim.
Skellige Boatbuilder 02|No… Nay, don't go, please! Don't leave me! I beg ye, please don't leave me!
Skellige Boatbuilder 02|You're back… Free me, please. I was framed, I speak true.
Skellige Boatbuilder 02|Never mind me, just need a bit o' rest. I thank ye for your help.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What happened here?
Skellige Girl 02|Me brother… They chained 'im to the rocks… Because of me!
Geralt|Why because of you?
Skellige Girl 02|Cause… 'Cause… 'Cause I didn't like me uncle, Gretter. He was fat and stank.
Skellige Girl 02|Once, I told me brother that uncle… did bad things to me. Yorg flew in a rage and killed him. Then they caught 'im and tied 'im to the rocks.
Geralt|That's how your laws work. A murderer has to be punished, even if he killed to save someone else.
Skellige Girl 02|But… but I lied to Yorg. Uncle did nothin' to me. He stank, and I didn't like 'im, that's it! And now… now Yorg'll die, 'cause o' me.
Geralt|Well maybe that'll teach you not to tell stories about others. So long.
Geralt|Your brother'll be fine, I freed him. He's bound to come and find you soon.
Skellige Girl 02|Truly? Thank ye, thank ye! I'll never tell another lie, I swear it.
Geralt|What'd your brother do? Why'd they chain him?

Verden Scavenger 03|Irwif indod o ifi, chiast.
Foreigner Woman 01|Nidydych inei gael!
Geralt|What're you doing here?
Verden Scavenger 03|Woman is criminal. Took child. Not hers.
Verden Scavenger 03|No believe her. Criminal! Must to die. I take plaetyn home.
Geralt|You can't hurt the woman… or take the child. I won't let you.
Verden Scavenger 03|Felli, gadael iddo fold.
Geralt|This is between you two. Won't interfere.
Geralt|What did the woman do? Why do you wanna take the child?
Verden Scavenger 03|Matter for king. Dirgelech. You not know.
Verden Scavenger 03|I seek them. Woman criminal. Child not hers, she took.
Geralt|Why should I believe you?
Foreigner Woman 01|Maen gorved! Gorved!
Verden Scavenger 03|Dima chi, alst!
Foreigner Woman 01|Biddich in melltitho gam!
Verden Scavenger 03|Irwif indod o ifi, chiast.

Verden Scavenger 03|You see maenwod… woman and plaetyn? From far, different talk, different cloth.
Geralt|Have I seen a foreign woman? With a… plaetyn?
Verden Scavenger 03|Yah. That. Foreign woman. From distant parts.
Geralt|No. Haven't seen anyone like that.
Verden Scavenger 03|I must find - foreign woman with plaetyn. I give gold.
Geralt|Why are you looking for them?
Verden Scavenger 03|They bad. Run from punishment. Evil only. Ill fortune.
Verden Scavenger 03|They here. Woman and plaetyn. Here evil and ill fortune.
Geralt|Sure, I've seen who you're looking for.
Verden Scavenger 03|Where? I gold give!
Geralt|No idea why you're looking for them. Sorry, can't help you.
Verden Scavenger 03|I lie? Rydych in talf cysgod! Iddo daink!
Geralt|Saw them in a cave. Nearby.
Verden Scavenger 03|Thank you. Take gold.
Verden Scavenger 03|You die!
Verden Scavenger 03|Kadanheil! Help!
Verden Scavenger 03|You goes! Begonered!

Foreigner Woman 01|Pawy idich ci? Bet wyte tinei?
Geralt|Calm down, I want to talk.
Foreigner Woman 01|Rawyn kasau iille, hepa fi.
Geralt|Your language… Reminds me of the language I saw in documents from a ship.
Geralt|Recognize this? Understand?
Foreigner Woman 01|Waethon ki dodohyd ify ilong?
Geralt|Take a look at this. Recognize it?
Foreigner Woman 01|Gwae fin!
Geralt|Keep it. Not like I have any use for it.
Geralt|Sorry, can't understand a thing. Want me to take you away? Is that it?
Foreigner Woman 01|Helpae fi allem.
Geralt|Sorry, but I don't know what you need.
Geralt|Farewell.
Foreigner Woman 01|Ewaech ife ford o fan hyn!
Foreigner Woman 01|Rydaw imor draeg...
Foreigner Woman 01|Clore! Aym pituna!
Geralt|Sorry, can't let you keep that. I don't actually know who you are.

Skellige Villager 06|Phew, thanks for the help.
Geralt|What was that about?
Skellige Villager 06|Ah, bugger can't handle that his sister'd rather sail to Lilac Bay with me than serve Freya.
Geralt|A Skelliger seducing a priestess? I thought--
Skellige Villager 06|Thought what? That we don't do "such things"? Not every man in the Isles believes that rubbish about the gods. But many can't accept that, and it leads to feuds, vendettas.
Skellige Villager 06|It's not right, not fair - I love Irma, and she loves me. There'll come a day we'll be together, I'll find a way. Religion's full of holes as logic's concerned, there's bound to be holes in its principles, too. I'll find 'em, show 'em to the priestesses. Then they'll let me wed my Irma.
Skellige Villager 06|You travel a lot, don't ye? Ever come across somethin' that can help me, bring it here. I'll pay ye well. I live in the hut the other side of the volcano.
Geralt|See what I can do. So long, and try to stay away from brothers in a rage.
Geralt|So he was trying to avenge his sister?
Skellige Villager 06|Aye, though I've no notion why. Didn't force her to do a thing, never hurt her in no way.
Skellige Villager 06|Ah, greetings. Got somethin' for me?
Geralt|I'm off. Farewell.
Skellige Villager 06|Thanks for your help. But I'm thinkin' I'll learn no more sittin' here. Time to see the world. Perhaps while I'm on my travels, I can figure out a way to be with Irma.
Geralt|Good luck.
Skellige Villager 06|Ever find somethin' that could help me, you know where I'll be.
Skellige Villager 06|"Tristianna and Isador" - could be useful, thanks.
Skellige Villager 06|"Religion and Life." Yeah… Not quite what I had in mind.
Skellige Villager 06|"The Curious Cases of Virtuous Vegga." Don't know what it's about, but I'll gladly give it a read.
Skellige Villager 06|"The Cult of Freya." Ah, this I definitely gotta read.
Skellige Villager 06|"Change Your Life! A Handbook for the Stubborn." Heh, oughta come in handy.
Skellige Villager 06|Thanks, I think I'm lookin' for somethin' else.

Skellige Old Man 02|Oi there, witcher! C'mere a minute. Case your wonderin', Simun Brambling's askin'!
Geralt|Greetings, Simun. Lugos decide to let you go?
Skellige Old Man 02|Nay. It was me decided to leave. Time's come to settle some scores. And you're gonna help me.
Skellige Old Man 02|A favor for a favor, remember? You owe me a debt. Pay it… or cover you and your whole line with shame.
Geralt|My line doesn't have too rosy a future anyway, but never mind that. What do I do?
Skellige Old Man 02|There's a lake here on Ard Skellig, near Blandare. A lone hut on its shore. We'll meet there. It's where I tell ye what comes next.
Skellige Old Man 02|Don't tarry long. Or you'll have me thinkin' you're tryin' to weasel out… and you don't want Simun Brambling to be thinkin' that.
Geralt|Same old Skellige shit: "Honor this, shame on that, glory to the other…" Dead tired of it.
Geralt|Not about to let you drag me into some mess just 'cause you say it's the right thing to do. Count me out, Simun. And don't bother me again.
Skellige Old Man 02|As you will, witcher. But beware… Break an oath in Skellige, you're likely shortenin' your life.
Geralt|Gotta tell me what it's about first.
Skellige Old Man 02|And I say ye needn't know. It's honor binds you to do what I say. Do whatever I fancy askin' ye.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Warrior 01|Knew you were thick, Brambling, but that thick? To waltz into me… Who the hell's this?
Skellige Old Man 02|Geralt of Rivia. A witcher.
Skellige Old Man 02|He's come to kill ye.
Geralt|What'd he do to you, Simun?
Skellige Warrior 01|Me?! To him?! 'Twas him who did me wrong! Whoreson killed me brother… Tricked him. Betrayed him. I swore revenge, hunted him across all the isles. Bugger always got away somehow. Till now, that is…
Skellige Old Man 02|High time we end this strife. Once and for all. No more questions, Geralt. Cut him down.
Geralt|Out of the question, Simun. I'm no murderer. Not gonna kill him.
Skellige Old Man 02|Then you'll die - at his side.
Geralt|Nothing personal, just paying a debt.
Skellige Warrior 01|Honor demands it, I get that… but it don't mean I'll ease your task any.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What's the problem?
Skellige Villager 03|A beast! It attacked me! Me and my comrade!
Skellige Hunter 01|We'll gut the fucker!
Skellige Villager 03|Aye, but not us - the witcher!
Skellige Hunter 01|Why bother the witchman?
Skellige Hunter 01|Like as not it were a pack of wolves! But they got you so afeared, you shat yourself and saw specters.
Skellige Hunter 01|Let me round up a few sturdy lads and we'll--
Skellige Villager 03|Won't be needed.
Skellige Villager 03|The witcher'll help, right? You shan't let us down.
Skellige Hunter 01|Faroe folk - dumb as stumps.
Geralt|Fine, what's this about - tell me.
Skellige Villager 03|Me and my mate were on our way here to Fyresdal with a cart full o' hides.
Skellige Villager 03|Suddenly we heard a screech. Our horse got spooked, started kickin' - and then, monsters jumped out o' the bushes!
Skellige Villager 03|My mate drew the short straw - they got him first. By some miracle I managed to get away.
Geralt|What kind of monsters?
Skellige Villager 03|Nekkuks, no doubt about it.
Geralt|What?
Skellige Villager 03|You know, sharp claws, animal skulls on their heads, attack in swarms…
Geralt|Nekkers?
Skellige Villager 03|Yeah, nekkers! Near twenty of 'em!
Skellige Villager 03|So, will ye help? Will ye kill the bastards?
Skellige Villager 03|That road needs be clear. Aim to travel it again soon.
Geralt|I'll help you.
Skellige Villager 03|Grand! Knew a witcher wouldn't let me down. Not like some waffly prick from Clan Drumdond…
Geralt|Or Clan Drummond.
Skellige Villager 03|Good luck, witcher! Fare ye well!
Geralt|Wait. Where should I look for you?
Skellige Villager 03|What?
Geralt|Once I finish. Where will I find you?
Skellige Villager 03|Oh! Aye, aye. Umm… here. Meanin' in the tavern nearby. I'll await ye there.
Geralt|Fine. See ya.
Geralt|Hm, don't know. You lost your transport, so I don't see how you're going to pay me. And I don't work for free.
Skellige Villager 03|I've coin set aside, I'm sure we'll agree terms. How much would you ask?
Geralt|Sorry, got more important matters to tend to.
Skellige Villager 03|No! Ye can't abandon me! Not like this!
Geralt|Fine. I'll do it. I'll help.
Geralt|That hunter wanted to help you. Might still catch him if you hurry.
Skellige Villager 03|But a witcher's what I need!
Geralt|Well this witcher's busy. Godspeed.
Skellige Villager 03|But if… if ye happen to pass that way, look into it? Please?
Geralt|That hunter - could he be right? Maybe it was just wolves.
Skellige Villager 03|I knows what I saw! Besides, who's he to say?
Skellige Villager 03|Those Drummond blaggards don't know shite from shoelaces.
Geralt|That particular blaggard was wearing an Craite colors.
Skellige Villager 03|Huh… ye sure about that?
Geralt|Surer than sure.
Skellige Villager 03|Ach, doesn't matter. That lot's not to be trusted, either.
Skellige Villager 03|Monsters attacked me. I need a witcher, not some hunter.
Geralt|You from Faroe? Come a long way…
Skellige Villager 03|That just happened. Came to Fyresdal to trade a load o' hides from Svorlag.
Geralt|Svorlag? Thought you were from Faroe - Svorlag's on Spikeroog.
Skellige Villager 03|Uhh… ah, well ye see, first I sailed from Faroe to Svorlag. Traded some loot from the Continent for hides there, then came here.
Geralt|Faroe to Spikeroog to Ard Skellig… huh, roundabout journey.
Skellige Villager 03|Ah, hadn't much choice, had I? A merchant sails where the trade's good, not where it's close at hand.
Skellige Villager 03|Excellent! It's a deal.
Skellige Villager 03|Ye see? I said we'd agree. So how'll it be?
Skellige Villager 03|A fair price. So how'll it be?
Skellige Villager 03|I'm countin' on you, witcher.
Skellige Villager 03|Help me, please. Got my hopes pinned on ye.
Skellige Woman 02|And? Then what?
Skellige Villager 03|Then nothin. Never you mind. This here's a job for a witcher.
Skellige Woman 02|As ye wish.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Trail ends here.
Geralt|Huh… who would think to hang drawings in a place like this?
Geralt|Looks like the work of a child… or someone who's damned clumsy with a quill.
Geralt|Huh, two sticks protruding above the shoulder. Think that might be… me.
Geralt|Is that a… wagon? And here's where that boulder almost crushed me.
Geralt|Nekker tracks near the boulder - now I know where they came from. Just wonder who actually left them.
Geralt|These balls on sticks are endregas. Guess they were supposed to finish me off.
Geralt|All in all, a pretty elaborate plan.
Geralt|And this must be the meeting place. Huh, looks like this whole "ambush" was a group effort.
Geralt|High time I met the pranksters.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Must be the place…
Geralt|You can come out. I've seen your plan.
Geralt|Besides, I can hear you.
Geralt|One of you's wheezing like a broken bellows.
Geralt|Another's panting frantically, like a deer caught in a trap.
Geralt|And the third should really take something for that throat. I'd try thyme extract.
Geralt|Someone care to explain what's going on here?
Skellige Villager 03|What's going on is that you're down there, and we're up here.
Geralt|That's a situation I can fix quickly.
Troll_3|Witchy-thingy no gobgob. Or Poldy witchy-thingy sroop make.
Skellige_godling|That's right! We've caught ye! Ye're at our mercy now - and we're none too merciful!
Geralt|Oh, really. Fact is, I could just turn around and--
Troll_3|Poldy telled: witchy-thingy gobgob shut keep. Or sroop make.
Skellige_werewolf|I wonder why he's not already in the "sroop."
Skellige_werewolf|You were to kill him hrrrr…
Skellige Villager 03|What?! We never said nothin' about killin'!
Skellige_godling|Not a thing. We were just supposed to scare 'im.
Troll_3|Show witchy-thingy us scary-thingys. Make him no touch us.
Skellige_werewolf|I believe you misunderstood hrr…
Skellige_werewolf|He's a murderer. Like the rest of them. Like the one who killed my Addalia hrrr hrrr hrrr…
Geralt|A doppler.
Skellige Warrior 02|Ahem. Awful sorry 'bout your wench - we all are. But this witcher didn't kill 'er. And we can't very well punish him for another's crime.
Skellige_werewolf|He has much to answer for, too hrrr. I heard he killed a korred in Toussaint.
Skellige_godling|But he spared a golden dragon!
Skellige_werewolf|So what? What about Vereena, the bruxa with a fondness for blue roses from Nazair? He showed her no mercy hrrrr hrrrr…
Geralt|Vereena killed many an innocent. I had to do something.
Geralt|But I've helped monsters aplenty.
Skellige_werewolf|Yes? Who?
Geralt|Morkvarg, the werewolf of Freya's garden - lifted his curse, and let him live.
Troll_3|Werewool. Like you. Witchy-thingy like were-thingys. No you hurt too, maybe.
Skellige_werewolf|Don't make me laugh. That's not nearly enough hrrrrrr…
Skellige_godling|Ye see? He's not that bad. We should let him go!
Skellige_werewolf|Let him go? Now? So he can track us down and butcher us?
Geralt|I won't hurt you. I don't kill sentient creatures.
Skellige_werewolf|You lie. Every witcher is a murderer hrrrrr!
Geralt|I kill monsters, true - it's my job. But only when they threaten humans.
Skellige_werewolf|You hate us, hate us all!
Geralt|Humans hate you all. 'Cause they don't know you. Don't know which of you are dangerous, and which want to live in peace.
Geralt|Only witchers stand between you and humans. We know both worlds, protect both.
Geralt|We kill dangerous monsters so the thinking ones can live in peace.
Skellige_werewolf|So ye say now, as ye stand there scared. Ye know we have the upper hand hrr hrrr hrrr!
Geralt|You don't. Could've killed you all long ago if I'd wanted to.
Skellige_godling|I believe 'im. We should let 'im be.
Skellige Warrior 02|I'm all for it. To my thinkin', he's telling the truth.
Troll_3|Let witchy-thingy go.
Skellige_werewolf|Grrraaagh! Fools! Gullible as newborns!
Skellige_werewolf|A just witcher, a kind witcher - a lying witcher, he feigns it all! All humans lie!
Skellige Warrior 02|Let it rest! This is not the way. Ye shan't bring Addalia back.
Skellige_werewolf|Ggggragggh! Stay here, I'll finish this alone - hrr.
Geralt|Salma, a succubus in Novigrad - let her go free. Even though I knew she'd killed some guardsmen.
Skellige Warrior 02|You mean… even when you know a monster's killed someone, you don't hurt them?
Geralt|If it had good reason - yeah, sometimes.
Geralt|I spared the troll named Wham-a-wham, though I knew he'd killed some miners.
Troll_3|Poldy know! Make yum-a-yum elfy sroop. And have yum-a-yum sis-sis…
Geralt|Some trolls live in a mountain pass near Kaer Morhen - know them? Poldy must, looks like their brother.
Geralt|Last time I was there, they were begging for a beating. My friend wanted to kill them. I talked him out of it.
Geralt|Not so long ago I spared the life of a doppler in Novigrad. He was stealing food for the Scoia'tael. Letting him go cost me a hefty bounty.
Skellige Warrior 02|Hm… I'm grateful. Not many of us left.
Geralt|There's this sylvan in Velen - you gotta know him. I had a choice - kill him and collect a reward from the local peasants, or talk it out with him. I chose the latter.
Skellige_godling|Sylvans are nasty schemers. But it was nice of you to spare 'im.
Geralt|Came across a godling in Novigrad recently. Sarah. I helped her.
Skellige_godling|Ye helped Sarah?! I know her! She's always playing hilarious pranks.
Geralt|Johnny, a godling living in Velen. Helped him recover his voice.
Skellige_godling|That's right! A little birdie told me! Now Johnny can say all his favorite words, loud as he likes.
Skellige_godling|The sound of "surreptitious shananacking" rings out over all Velen!
Geralt|I helped a godling. Two, in fact - Johnny and Sarah.
Skellige_godling|That's true! I heard about that!
Geralt|Errr, changed my mind. Not about to parley with monsters.
Geralt|Come here. Alone or with that pack of yours, doesn't matter. Let's end  this.
Skellige_werewolf|Grrraarrhh, gladly.
Skellige_godling|Uhh… just remembered - I left a cauldron on the fire!
Skellige_werewolf|Any other cowards?!
Troll_3|Poldy uncoward!
Skellige Warrior 02|Three against one - we might stand a chance.
Skellige_werewolf|Gggggrrrrgggh! Get 'im!
Geralt|Won't show you any, either. Considered it for a moment there, but you made up my mind for me.
Geralt|Now come here. Alone or with that pack of yours. Let's end this.
Geralt|True, I killed Vereena. But you still got a chance, could still leave with your lives.
Geralt|Let's part in peace before someone gets hurt.
Skellige_werewolf|Hrrr… Is that a threat?
Geralt|I'm trying to save your lives. Won't touch you as long as you don't attack. But one false move, and I'll have to defend myself.
Geralt|Any last words?
Skellige Villager 03|Us? You're the prisoner.
Geralt|Sure about that?
<|endoftext|>
Skellige_werewolf|They've fled hrr! It doesn't matter. You're done!
Skellige_werewolf|You will die - for her! For my Addalia! Grraaagh!
Skellige_werewolf|Uuuggghhrrrr!
Geralt|Heh, done with that.
Skellige_werewolf|You're dead, witcher!
Troll_3|Witchy-thingy mash make! For srooooop!
Skellige Warrior 02|Lucky bastard! Ye were to end as arachas fodder.
Troll_3|Witchy-thingy kills! Kill witchy-thingy!
Skellige Warrior 02|What'd that poor troll ever do to you?!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Leave him alone.
Novigrad Thug Weak 03|And who might you be? Temple Guard, undercover?
Geralt|Call me an admirer of law and order.
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Made a mistake comin' to this town, then.
Geralt|You're making the mistake. Leave him alone.
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|And if we don't?
Geralt|If you don't, I'll have to kick your faces in.
Novigrad Thug Weak 03|D'you hear that, lads?
Geralt|This man's not worth your efforts. His shop's drowning in debt.
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|You're right. Even looks like a pauper.
Novigrad Trader 03|I beg to differ!
Novigrad Thug Weak 03|Don't even know why I bothered the bugger. My apologies, and fare thee well.
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|I, uh, gotta go brush me teeth.
Geralt|Well, I tried. But all in all, it's not my problem.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Thank you for your help. That's the only way to deal with this rabble. They beg for trouble.
Geralt|And you're begging for trouble, just coming here at this hour. Especially dressed like that.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|I've come on business.
Geralt|Good luck with that.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Wait… You helped me once, perhaps you'd be willing to do it again. For more than a kind word this time.
Geralt|What's involved? Just to be clear, I'm neither a bodyguard nor an assassin for hire.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Now what makes you think I need either of those? I'd simply ask you to accompany me on a stroll. Should anything happen along the way, well… perhaps then you might need to do some work for your pay.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|What say you to that?
Geralt|Agreed. I'll be right behind you.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Keep your hand on your hilt. As a general matter of precaution, of course.
Geralt|Of course. Always do that when I'm out for a stroll.
Geralt|Think you can handle this on your own. Nobody pays for company during a normal stroll, and if they do, I'm just not up for that sort of thing.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Strange lack of pragmatism for a witcher. You've passed up a marvelous opportunity to earn a considerable sum.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Farewell.
Geralt|You can't afford me.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Ah, amusing. The matter that brings me here happens to be very profitable. So, if it's merely a question of coin, I'm sure we will reach an agreement.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|You're late.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|I'm afraid I had some unexpected adventures along the way. However, we can now focus on our core concern, and that is what matters.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Who's the fellow followed you here?
Novigrad Nobleman 03|He's my gardener. I never go anywhere without him. He's good luck, you see.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Just no funny stuff, got it?
Geralt|…
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Right, on with it before winter snows surprise us. Got four quarts for you now, and can get you another two real quick, provided you're not lyin' about demand.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|I am Ginter de Lavirac and I never go back on my word. I had no trouble distributing the last four quarts and assure you there's demand for more.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|We'll see 'bout that. For now, you owe me five thousand crowns for the last batch.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|We agreed on four thousand, and I don't like cheats. I suggest you refrain from trying to pull anything lest you feel a witcher's blade in your gut.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Right?
Geralt|Don't care who owes who or how much. But this man is supposed to pay me, so I'd rather he not get fleeced.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Witcher or not, you can't hope to drop us all.
Geralt|Wanna find out?
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Peace brings prosperity, and strife's bad for business. Fine, make it four thousand. Let's go.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Pure pleasure doing business with you.
Geralt|Wrong. This is between you two - I'm waiting to get paid.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Not willin' to meddle in other folks' business - pleased to hear it.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Don't let 'im get away.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Wise choice.
Geralt|I'm not that sure. Just lost what I was due to be paid.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Wrong on that count. We'll give you the same sum as this whoreson agreed to pay.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|But witcher!
Geralt|What's going on here?
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Oh. Listen, mind watering those cornflowers over there?
Geralt|No cornflowers here.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Look harder.
Geralt|Make it quick. I don't have all day.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Startin' to like this gardener of yours.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|All right. What've you got there?
Halfling Man 01|Magic accessories. Alchemy ingredients, potions, and much more.
Geralt|Interesting. Don't look a bit like a mage.
Halfling Man 01|True, perhaps because I'm not a mage. I just… take care of the sundries the poor folk who burn at the stake leave behind. Ensure they end up in the right hands.
Geralt|Fine, what do you have?
Halfling Man 01|Naught but rarities, at unbeatable pri--…. Oh shit! You didn't see me here!
Witch Hunter 01|The halfling - what did he want? And why'd he bolt when he saw us comin'?
Geralt|Has to stay out of your way. 'Cause he sells the things dead mages leave behind.
Witch Hunter 01|Eternal Fire burns bright thanks to men like you. Hans! Gustav! Added pay to whoever nabs the halfling!
Geralt|Left his soup on the burner.
Witch Hunter 01|I've half a mind to put you on the burner, wise arse. Got my eye on you. Let's go!
Geralt|I don't do deals with vultures.
Halfling Man 01|Lookin' to buy?
<|endoftext|>
Elf Man 01|Thank you, vatt'ghern. If you hadn't intervened, they'd have snipped my ears, like they did Faelar's… Or worse.
Geralt|I'd leave Novigrad if I were you.
Elf Man 01|How about that. Nonhumans bother you as well?
Geralt|Me? No… The Eternal Fire, yes… They've got other scapegoats to burn right now, but it won't belong before they come for you.
Elf Man 01|I don't believe they will. They'd not dare go that far.
Geralt|I was in Rivia in 1268 - during the massacre. Know exactly what I'm talking about.
Geralt|Take care of yourselves, now.
Elf Man 01|Meaning? What would you have me do? Never leave my home? Step off the pavement to let a human pass?
Geralt|Farewell.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Think the lady's grown tired of your company.
Novigrad Peasant 01|Lady? What lady? See her ears? She-elf! And everyone knows that elves are always doin' somethin' on the sly!
Scoiatael Woman 01|I'm not doing anything, I swear it. I must just fetch some water.
Novigrad Peasant 02|Where will you put it? Where's your jug, eh?! Where's your bucket?!
Geralt|Leave her be.
Novigrad Peasant 01|By what right're you givin' me orders? Eh?
Novigrad Peasant 02|Let's go, Raddy. Killin's like battin' an eye for witchmen.
Geralt|You can breathe. It's over.
Scoiatael Woman 01|Over? For you, perhaps - you'll go your merry way… But I must stay here. And they will, too.
Geralt|Nothing I can do about that.
Scoiatael Woman 01|Then why get involved at all?
Scoiatael Woman 01|You didn't scare those boors off for my sake, but for your own. To feel just and noble. A knight on a swiving white steed. Or do I have it all wrong?
Scoiatael Woman 01|Go, vatt'ghern… And remember - we neither need nor want your pity.
Geralt|Stop, can't handle all this gratitude. We really oughta learn our manners from the Elder Races, that's plain to see.
Scoiatael Woman 01|What would you expect? Payment? Or am I to fall into your arms, perhaps spread my legs for you?!
Geralt|Why don't you just tell the truth?
Novigrad Peasant 01|Whaddaya mean, why? She's a nonhuman, lyin's in their blood!
Novigrad Peasant 02|Don't let that fair face beguile you, witcher. Pretty as a picture on the outside, she-elves… but the most vile filth within.
Geralt|This is none of my business. Figure it out yourselves.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What's going on here?
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Fuck all to do with you! Piss off!
Geralt|Lady doesn't feel like talking to you.
Novigrad Prostitute 02|I can handle this.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Shut yer trap!
Geralt|Get lost.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Errrm…
Novigrad Prostitute 02|Who told you to butt in, eh?
Geralt|Huh?
Novigrad Prostitute 02|You all right, darlin'?
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|This masquerade… just not a good idea, I don't think.
Novigrad Prostitute 02|Ugh, see what you've done?! He's broken character now.
Geralt|I think I'll be on my way.
Novigrad Prostitute 02|I should think so.
Geralt|Get outta here, or I'll kill you.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Criminy, what's with the aggro, the talk o' killin', doll?!
Geralt|I can make him leave.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|I'm lost. Is he in the scenario?
Geralt|Scenario?
Novigrad Prostitute 02|Stop spoilin' our fun, all right?
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Agh, great. Ugh, this git's completely blown the mood for me.
Geralt|Lemme get out of your way. Just… maybe find some place a little more secluded?
Geralt|All right, figure it out without me.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Fuck off, White One! Nobody gives a shit what you think! And you, get yer arse movin'! Let's go!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|I swear… you're worse than door-to-door peddlers.
Witch Hunter 04|Leave, witcher. Or I'll find some iron jewelry for you, too.
Mage 01|Help me! They'll burn me! Burn me alive! I've done nothing!
Witch Hunter 04|Nothing? Nothing?! Who concocted those poisonous potions? Who helped the Lodge of Sorceresses, sending them reports via megascope? Who addled men's minds with magic, eh?! I know you, Remi. I know you and your crimes.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|That was long past. It shan't happen again!
Witch Hunter 01|Oh, we'll make sure it don't. Shackle him. His cunt, too.
Novigrad Boy 01|Mummy!
Geralt|Can't allow this.
Witch Hunter 04|No one's asking your mind, mutant.
Geralt|Still think you'll listen to me. Or to my sword.
Witch Hunter 01|To me! At him!
Geralt|Collective responsibility, is that it? Not terribly fond of that strain of justice… But don't worry… won't get involved.
Witch Hunter 01|Good of you. See, witchers are like dogs - useful so long as they do what they're trained for. But when they start biting the wrong hands, no one hesitates to break their necks.
Geralt|Ooh, think I actually will bite… And it'll be the right hands.
Geralt|Lovely speech. Almost set my tail wagging… So long.
Witch Hunter 01|See? Even the freaks scorn you, Remi. Take him!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Looks like a nobleman…
Triss|Could be just that. Come with me, I can't perform the ritual here.
Geralt|I think it's a soldier…
Triss|We'll know soon enough. Come with me - I know a place where the walls don't have ears.
Geralt|We'll do this later. I gotta go.
Triss|Artifact compression. Someone got themselves enchanted in this figurine.
Geralt|Intend to decompress?
Triss|Of course. Whoever cast the spell on the poor soul must've forgotten about him.
Triss|C'mon, we have to decompress him.
Geralt|Look what I picked up.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Let's try it. Think it's a nobleman…
Triss|Be on your guard. It could be something far more dangerous.
Temerian Merchant 01|Heu-geh! No! Coral, nooo! I-I can explain everything! Akh akh akh…
Triss|Coral?
Temerian Merchant 01|I never looked at the lass… you are my one and only!
Temerian Merchant 01|Oooh… You're not Coral. Some succubus, a delusion… Where am I?
Geralt|What is your name?
Temerian Merchant 01|Mmm?
Triss|We're in Novigrad. No-vi-grad.
Temerian Merchant 01|In Novigrad? Last I recall, I was in Oxenfurt and Coral was furious. How can she demand fidelity when she herself is wanton as… as…
Geralt|As youthful goats.
Temerian Merchant 01|Exactly. Dammit, I feel as if I've been trampled by a herd of cattle. I've no notion what she did to me, but it seems you've delivered me from my misfortune.
Temerian Merchant 01|Here, take this. Have a good time, paint the town coral.
Triss|Whose taste has grown worse since you were sleeping with her. Come on, the kind-hearted gentleman'll get along fine on his own.
Geralt|I've got another figurine.
Geralt|Let's try to decompress this one. Anything I can do to help?
Triss|Yes. Be quiet and try not to disturb me.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 04|{Ver d’eer! En zer Ker'zaer! } [For Honor! For The Emperor!]
Nilfgaardian Soldier 04|{Woh erre sinde? Waen iche hene? } [Who are you? What am I doing here?]
Nilfgaardian Soldier 04|{Esse pund… } [I am going to vomit…]
Geralt|You're exhausted. Always happens with compression. Get some rest.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 04|Yes, I should.
Triss|Once you've recovered a bit, you should find Ambassador var Attre. He's sure to help.
Triss|Good luck.
Geralt|That was… interesting.
Triss|And exhausting. Ugh, to fall onto a featherbed and sleep till… well, till I woke.
Geralt|Who are you? What's the last thing you remember?
Nilfgaardian Soldier 04|I remember a hill… a battle. I had orders, for a unit… I remember a sorceress, her hair likes flames… She cast a spell.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 04|The right flank was to attack, hit the shield bearers.
Triss|The right flank didn't attack. And the sorceress was Lytta Neyd, known also as Coral. I was there, too… This… this happened long ago.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 04|{Sheyssere. } [Shit.]
Geralt|Place is pretty grim.
Triss|True, it looks like a vampire's hideout. Which is why we can be pretty sure no one'll bother us here.
Triss|Give me the figurine and stand back.
Geralt|So Coral enchanted him. Just like her.
Triss|If there's a more vindictive sorceress, I don't know her. Well, except maybe…
Temerian Merchant 01|Coral's not here? In that case… come to me, succubus.
Triss|Yn all’an daonna ar ais…
Triss|Everything's ready. Let's get to work.
Triss|Yn all’an daonna ar ais…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Interesting basilisk you've got there.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Course it's interestin'! Won't see a beast like this anywhere near here! They spawn only in the wild wastes of Zerrikania - from eggs laid by cockerels!
Geralt|This basilisk is interesting because it looks exactly like a wyvern. Young one, and ill-fed at that.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|You talk nonsense, sir. This here's the most truest of basilisks!
Geralt|Right, what do I know. I'm just a witcher.
Redanian Soldier 01|Hold on, now! If that's no basilisk, but some weevern, what did I pay for? Give me back my coin, cheat!
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Brave soldiers, don't push, or it'll-- Whoa, watch out!
Geralt|Cockerel eggs, you say…
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|And what cocks they are! Lift their rumps like brood hens to other cocks! Eggs laid by such a cockerel must be brought to hatchin' by a hundred and one venomous vipers! Then the young basilisk pecks its way out…
Geralt|Well, well… Spent years hunting monsters, and yet I'm still learning.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Look on, soldiers! Even a witcher scurries from the mighty basilisk. For all beasts fear it, even dragons… what'm I sayin', crocodiles! And crocodiles are inconceivably terrifyin', as anyone who's seen one will attest!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Know what rhymes with "wicked witcher"?
Geralt|My things, before I turn you into mincemeat.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Must be a slant rhyme…
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Shut your trap and give it back!
Novigrad Rich Man 02|So then… We are square, even, good… yes?
Geralt|Yeah, we're good. Get outta here before I change my mind.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Of course, master witcher. We're off. One-two-gone already!
Geralt|Not quite. We'll be good once you give me your things.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|All of them…?
Geralt|You can keep your knickers.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Fine, I'll handle the bandits. Go to your homes, bar the doors.
Novigrad Peasant 01|Beware o' them, witcher. They're the dangerous type, truly.
Geralt|Sorry. You'll have to manage on your own.
Novigrad Peasant 01|Witcher, don't abandon us!
Novigrad Peasant 03|Let it rest, Egan. 'Twas clear from the start he'd not help. On your way, vagrant.
Geralt|Who's Little Red?
Novigrad Poor Man 01|Word is she fornicates with wolves, and can tear a man apart with her bare mitts! A she-beast in a human husk, though some call her a great beauty.
Novigrad Peasant 02|She leads a pack of deserters, true dregs, from different armies. The kind what knows killin' and plunderin' well…
Geralt|Why's this band want revenge, on you of all people?
Novigrad Peasant 11|Cause… 'Cause I ratted on 'em to the witch hunters.
Geralt|Witch hunters care about bandits? Since when?
Novigrad Peasant 01|Little Red's band, they was terrorizing our village. We had none to defend us. Finally Bertram went by the hunters, asked them.
Novigrad Peasant 01|So the hunters went after 'em. We had a spell of peace, but now Little Red's learned of it all. Wants to kill Bertram. He's done for if you don't help.
Geralt|What's the problem?
Novigrad Peasant 03|Oh, nothin', on your way now, good man.
Novigrad Peasant 01|Shut it, Gottard. He could help.
Novigrad Peasant 01|Little Red's band means to attack the village. Want revenge on Bertram. We haven't much, but we're willin' to pay if you defend us.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Whatever you're planning, plan's gotta change. I can't-- won't let you hurt these people.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|I'm not here to hurt anyone 'cept that scoundrel Bertram. Came to me unbeckoned, a half year back. Said he'd betray who's worth lootin', for a share in the takings, o' course.
Geralt|I won't get in your way. Do what you gotta.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Right decision, witcher.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|See? Quick and painless. That's for you. For understandin'.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Let's go, gents!
Geralt|Don't care much what you say. Take your men and get lost - or there'll be blood.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Oh, there'll be blood either way. You just ensured there'll be more of it.
Geralt|What'd Bertram do to you to warrant vengeance?
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Haha, mean they didn't mention this bit? Then listen: he came to me a half year back. Said he'd point out who's worth lootin'… in return for a share o' the takings.
Geralt|They did - to defend them from monsters. And humans who can be monsters.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|And you believe me to be such?
Geralt|Are you?
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Find out for yourself, if you dare. Or give me Bertram and no one else'll get hurt.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|A witcher… Did the villagers hire you?
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|But some time on the bugger grew greedy. He wanted more, I refused. That's when he set the witch hunters on us. Lost half me men 'cause of 'im!
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Now step aside, witcher. This ain't your affair. We want Bertram, no one else. You've my word.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|You all right?
Redanian Townswoman 01|Fine. Truth be told I'd 'ave managed it on my own… But thank you.
Geralt|Walk you home?
Redanian Townswoman 01|Hey now! I'm grateful, sure, but I'll not demonstrate that in the alcove!
Geralt|Walk you home. That's it.
Redanian Townswoman 01|Hmm… In that case, yes… Come.
Geralt|You'd 'ave managed it? Managed those men? By yourself?
Redanian Townswoman 01|Of course! Knee to the bollocks, elbow to the throat, job done!
Geralt|All right. Be careful, now. Won't always be someone there to protect you…
Redanian Townswoman 01|I know. I didn't come to Novigrad on yesterday's hay cart.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|How many people's lives have you saved? From bruxae? From leshens?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|That has no bearing--
Geralt|Asked you a question. How many?
Geralt|There's something to think about, folks.
Geralt|For a relic, I'm pretty darn good with a sword. Know a cut where you'd bleed to death before you hit the ground.
Geralt|Run out of things to say? Good.
Geralt|Waste of words, talking to you.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Then go! Begone!
Geralt|Got the courage to repeat that slander to my face?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Readily! You are a mutant! A freak! A useless relic of a bygone age that should be burned like a withered branch!
Novigrad Peasant 02|Preacher's fierce in the mouth. But holler at 'im and his tail slinks between his legs! C'mon, people.
<|endoftext|>
Redanian Soldier 01|Turn back. Bridge is closed.
Geralt|On whose orders?
Redanian Soldier 01|By order of His Grace, King Radovid himself. Which means I'm not to let me own mum through without a valid pass.
Geralt|Mhm. I've got a pass.
Redanian Soldier 01|Hmm… let's see…
Redanian Soldier 01|Everything looks to be in order.
Geralt|All right, let me cross.
Redanian Soldier 01|Are you in a rush? Got somethin' concealed, maybe?
Geralt|Wanna frisk me?
Redanian Soldier 01|Hah! What? You out for a fondlin'? We've no time for games, witcher. Lads, let 'im through!
Geralt|Listen, how do I get a pass?
Redanian Soldier 01|You've got to have important state business the other side. Then you'd get one.
Geralt|How much I gotta pay to have important state business?
Redanian Soldier 01|No need to be clever, witcher. Just gotta know the right people.
Geralt|Which ones are they?
Redanian Soldier 01|Someone from the new regime'd be best. Or maybe… you know Albin Hart's brother-in-law?
Geralt|Who?
Redanian Soldier 01|Ehh, never mind.
Geralt|Guess that means I'm done here.
Redanian Soldier 01|Gotta pass yet? Don't be botherin' me if you don't!
<|endoftext|>
Redanian Soldier 03|Halt! No passage. Bridge is closed.
Geralt|Because?
Redanian Soldier 03|Cause King Radovid said it should be. Won't let anyone through who don't have a pass.
Geralt|Perfect. Just so happens I have a pass.
Redanian Soldier 03|Whaa? Lemme see…
Redanian Soldier 03|Doesn't seem forged, but you never know… All right, move on.
Geralt|Who issues these passes?
Redanian Soldier 03|Why you need to know? Your kind don't get passes, anyway. Not the right type, heheh.
Geralt|My kind has its ways. We just have to know where to look.
Redanian Soldier 03|Ah, well, that's different… It's royal officials who issue the official passes.
Geralt|Take it there're also unofficial ones, then?
Redanian Soldier 03|Mh, contraband, if you will, black market issue. You might ask folk near the crossings.
Geralt|Do just that.
Geralt|Farewell.
Geralt|Come on, give it a good think… I'm sure you know where I can get a pass.
Redanian Soldier 03|Errr…. Yeah… Royal officials issue 'em. But they're also available on the black market.
Geralt|From who?
Redanian Soldier 03|Don't know the names…. Ask folk around the crossin's. They'll know more.
Redanian Soldier 03|Oh, it's you… Can't let you pass without a… pass.
<|endoftext|>
Redanian Soldier 01|Halt!
Redanian Soldier 01|As per decree number 1408/DZ/54 of His Royal Majesty King Radovid V, passage over the bridge is possible only upon demonstration of a requisite permit.
Geralt|Here.
Redanian Soldier 01|Hm… Numbered… Dated… Signed by the Marshal of Civil Defense and the ambassador…
Redanian Soldier 01|Seems to be in order. Move on through.
Geralt|What? A permit?
Redanian Soldier 01|In accordance with decree 1408--
Geralt|Tell it to me straight, like a human being.
Redanian Soldier 01|King Radovid has decided only those with a valid transit permit may cross the Pontar.
Geralt|Who issues these permits?
Redanian Soldier 01|I'm not authorized to divulge that information.
Geralt|Farewell.
Redanian Soldier 03|Halt! No passage.
Geralt|Case of the plague surface in the city or something?
Redanian Soldier 03|The plague? Errr, no. We're to not let folk in the city. It's an order, so I don't. Unless someone's got a pass.
Geralt|This what you mean?
Redanian Soldier 03|Let me look at that…
Redanian Soldier 03|Hmm… Hmm… Missing a seal, the red one…
Geralt|Impossible…
Redanian Soldier 03|Department of Civil Defense, forgot again… They're really off their heads these days.
Redanian Soldier 03|Happens. So be it. You may come through.
Geralt|What kind of pass're we talking about?
Redanian Soldier 03|Well, a normal one, a transit pass.
Geralt|Who issues them?
Redanian Soldier 03|How should I know? I'm a lowly soldier…
Geralt|Who ordered the city gates closed?
Redanian Soldier 03|Word is, the king himself.
Redanian Soldier 03|Doesn't want paupers and refugees pissing all over his beautiful city.
Redanian Soldier 03|Apart from which, when folk can go hither and thither, always a chance some spy'll slink through. This way, spy's got it harder…
Redanian Soldier 03|So, no pass, no passage.
Redanian Soldier 03|Halt! You'll need to present a pass if want to cross.
<|endoftext|>
Redanian Soldier 11|Halt! Or we'll shoot!
Redanian Soldier 13|Turn back!
Redanian Soldier 13|Or you will be shot!
Redanian Soldier 11|Loose! Kill him!
Redanian Soldier 13|Shoot at will! He cannot pass!
Redanian Soldier 11|Argh, damn the bugger. The patrols will track him down.
Redanian Soldier 13|It's no good, you know! Patrols all around! They'll catch you! They'll deal with you!
Redanian Soldier 11|There! Now stay there!
Redanian Soldier 13|Last time you got away with that!

Geralt|Wondering if I could take part in the races.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|If you've coin for the rider's fee and a steed of your own - why not?
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Decide quickly, please. There's a race about to begin.
Geralt|I wanna race.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Grand. Your name and the name of your steed?
Geralt|Geralt of Rivia on Roach.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Excellent. Your opponent, let me see… Seamus Holt astride Athos.
Geralt|Like to race again.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Excellent, don't go anywhere, we'll start soon. Your opponent this time - Viscount Rommer astride Caniculus.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|The viscount races incognito, so I must ask for your discretion.
Geralt|Wanna try again.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Gained an appetite, have we? Your opponent this time - Luc Vegelbud, young Lord Albert's cousin, atop Succubus.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|He's the black sheep of the family, but he's not lost a race yet, so he's seen as something of a local champion.
Geralt|These races - tell me about them.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|They're run as per Erasmus Vegelbud's dying wish. He came into his fortune by gambling and remained proud of the fact to the end.
Geralt|Family doesn't mind having a race track right by their house?
Novigrad Rich Man 01|But the house, his fortune, would not even be theirs had they not fulfilled Lord Erasmus' wish - he made it a condition.
Geralt|Any special rules for the races?
Novigrad Rich Man 01|They're as simple as Lord Erasmus was. Two competitors, simultaneous start, first to complete a lap around the track wins.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Another race? Will you ride?
Novigrad Rich Man 01|It's no shame to lose to the best. Which doesn't mean you shouldn't keep trying.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Shall I sign you up for another?
Novigrad Rich Man 01|You lost by a nose.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Kudos! After all these years, we've a new champion!
Novigrad Rich Man 01|That's no small feat, you ought to be proud of yourself!
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Not bad. Yet we shouldn't kid ourselves, the competition was hardly stiff.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Bravo. Congratulations, you won in style.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Luc Vegelbud is good, but he's not unbeatable.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Fantastic race! Congratulations, a grand victory!
Novigrad Rich Man 01|What terrible luck for you. Well, there's always the next time.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Hear ye! Hear ye! The final of the Erasmus Vegelbud Memorial Derby is over! The winner is Geralt of Rivia, riding Roach!
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Glory to the victor!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Thanks for the invite.
Karl Varese|Congratulations. Quite the win at the Vegelbuds'. Luc's one hell of a prick, but I don't recall him ever losin' before.
Karl Varese|And seein' as you outran him, you actually stand a chance at Palio. Make some real coin.
Geralt|Fine, I'll race.
Karl Varese|Lovely, color me thrilled. Just don't bloody let me down, 'cause I'm about to bet a small fortune on you.
Karl Varese|Go prepare. Drink some chamomile or whatever the fuck you do.
Geralt|Palio? Never heard of it.
Karl Varese|Fuck me, what a peasant. The Palio's a race held at night in the city streets. Used to be every district sponsored a competitor. Things are different now.
Karl Varese|You're gonna race jockeys put forward by Bedlam and Reuven, but my coin's on you.
Geralt|Don't feel like racing anymore.
Karl Varese|Shame. You're passin' on an arse-load o' coin. We've a bit 'fore it starts - so come back if you change your thinkin'.
Karl Varese|So what'll it be?
Karl Varese|Great fuck. Could've whittled meself a jockey outta birch, stained him with piss and he would 'uve done better than you.
Geralt|Shit happens.
Karl Varese|Aye, it sure fuckin' do. That's business - sometimes you kick the cow, sometimes it kicks you.
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Temple Guard! Scatter!
Karl Varese|I'm fuckin' done here. Stay outta my way for a while.
Karl Varese|We gotta get the fuck outta here. Thanks, Geralt!
Karl Varese|Give us a kiss, Geralt!
Karl Varese|No? Then I'll smooch that Roach of yours. That were lovely!
Geralt|And my pay?
Karl Varese|Take it, you cheeky bastard. Never met a man who earned his coin fairer than you did today.

Novigrad Trader 01|Geralt of Rivia, known as the White Wolf? The Butcher of Blaviken?
Geralt|Geralt of Rivia's enough. What is it?
Novigrad Trader 01|A man came to me a few years past, paid me to keep a book for you. Said you'd come for it one day.
Geralt|Who was he?
Novigrad Trader 01|Umm… He didn't introduce himself. But the book has a red cover, that I remember. I'm sure I've not sold it.
Geralt|All right, see if I can find it.
Novigrad Trader 01|And perhaps glance at the others while you're at it?
Geralt|Be glad to look over what you got.
Geralt|Just interested in the one.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Old Man 03|A witcher? Oh! Here about the notice, perchance?
Geralt|Not quite… but what's it about? I hear right - you're going on some voyage, need a companion?
Novigrad Old Man 03|Not just "some" voyage - 'cross the sea! Mark this: when I got pressed into the infantry in 1242, I promised my beloved Letta I'd return alive, whole and with a pearl from Skellige. Not just any pearl, either. A black one! The rarest and most precious!
Geralt|Well, well… Ambitious.
Novigrad Old Man 03|Perhaps… But they were empty words. I came from the war, that one and the next, but I never fulfilled my promise. High time to change that. For if not now, then when?
Novigrad Old Man 03|Thing is… I've grown old in the meantime. As you see! Can't manage it alone, need a strong shoulder to lean on… and a witcher's shoulder's as strong as they come! So… whaddaya say?
Geralt|Plan's crazier than it is sane… But there's an irresistible charm to it. Offer me some pay, and I'll help you out.
Novigrad Old Man 03|Don't you fret about coin - I brought home a good deal of it from various fronts. Say we meet in Skellige, by the collapsed bridge near Arinbjorn. It's but a hop away from the bed where black pearls are born. Will that work for you?
Geralt|Sounds fine. See you there.
Geralt|Sorry, got other things to worry about. Good luck, though… you'll need a bit of that.
Geralt|Indeed. Going on some voyage, looking for a companion, right?
Geralt|Never mind. Farewell.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Black pearl, just like you wanted.
Novigrad Old Man 03|Beautiful, rare… like my Letta. Well, as Constable Natalis would say, you've earned a medal - or better yet, a week's leave in a brothel!
Geralt|Coin'll be fine.
Novigrad Old Man 03|Oh yes, erm… about that. Listen… I-I feel right foolish, but… well, I didn't bring any coin with me.
Geralt|Wise.
Novigrad Old Man 03|Wasn't it? Even the high roads are dangerous now. Not what they once were…
Novigrad Old Man 03|We'll meet in Novigrad. I'll pay you, to the last copper. Foot soldier's honor!
Geralt|Don't try to cheat me.
Novigrad Old Man 03|And earn a witcher's ire? I'm old, but I'm not stupid!
Geralt|Dammit. Splashing must've attracted them. You all right?
Novigrad Old Man 03|Nicked in a few places. But if I pulled through after Sodden, I'll survive this, too. So, any luck?
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Old Man 03|Geralt, witcher and pearl hunter! There y'are, your coin. Earned every last bit… I'd never 'uve done it without you.
Geralt|Was it worth it?
Novigrad Old Man 03|I think so, aye… I suppose Letta likes it.
Geralt|Sure as hell should. Pretty damn ungrateful of her otherwise.
Novigrad Old Man 03|It's… a bit more complicated.
Novigrad Old Man 03|See, uh, Letta's sick. Somethin'… somethin's not right in her head. Started with her memory, she'd forget things, then… then she stopped recognizin' folk, even me. And now… now she don't even speak.
Novigrad Old Man 03|Thought if she saw the pearl somethin'd wake inside her. You know… We talked a lot about that stupid promise - it was our joke, just ours, for years. But… no, no… It didn't work.
Geralt|Sorry.
Novigrad Old Man 03|As am I. Farewell, Geralt. Gods guide you the Path.
Geralt|What? She say something about what you did?
Novigrad Old Man 03|Letta… She don't say much of anything anymore. Hasn't for a while.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|Who's there?
Geralt|Witcher Geralt.
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|Get in here.
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|Boss awaits upstairs.
Geralt|No. Out of the question. If that's how you want to do it, I'm out.
Dijkstra|Geralt… Are you yellow?
Geralt|Gave it a thought, saw the light. Never should've gotten involved… Farewell, kingslayers.
Geralt|Mhm. Only thing I've found is her hideout.
Geralt|What's your point?
Dijkstra|We can use Philippa without involving her, provided you help.
Dijkstra|Radovid expects you to report to him, bring him information about her. All you need do is mention her name, intimate that you've a lead, you're on her trail…
Talar|Oh, he'll swallow that. Hook, line, sinker and a good bit of the rod as well!
Geralt|Let's say Radovid bites, believes me, and none of that's a given… What then?
Dijkstra|You'll tell him you've found Philippa's hideout. Somewhere where we can easily set a trap, and ambush… Suggestions?
Talar|Bridge to Temple Isle. Built up, both sides. Lots of nooks, gates. Easy to block off from the rest of the city.
Roche|Good idea. I'll divide my men, post half on one end, other half on the other, by the gate. And in the middle, Ves with a well-oiled crossbow.
Dijkstra|You see, Geralt. All we ask is that you invite Radovid out for a stroll, bring him to the bridge. We'll take care of the rest. So what'll it be?
Geralt|I'm in… But once it's done. What then? There'll be an uproar in the city, panic maybe. Need a place where we can wait it out.
Dijkstra|Thought of that already. Remember Madame Irina's theater? Abandoned now, not a soul looks in there. Thaler and I will await you there.
Geralt|Await us? Unwilling to risk your own necks?
Talar|Not the point. Dijkstra and I've many cocksuckin' virtues, but fightin' ability's just not one of them. About as fit for that as we are for a bleedin' beauty pageant.
Roche|Don't worry, Geralt. My people're battle hardened. They'll manage. You just bring them the king.
Geralt|Do what I can. Where's his ship moored these days?
Dijkstra|Just round the corner, in Novigrad's port. And for your sake, I hope he's in a good mood when you look in on him.
Geralt|You know, it's just not something I'm willing to do.
Roche|What? Geralt, what're you saying?
Geralt|Your plan - pretty damn risky. And I've got somebody to live for, I've got Ciri to find.
Dijkstra|Ciri's not the whole damn world.
Geralt|Speak for yourself.
Roche|Good idea. I'll divide my men, post half on one end, other half on the other, by the gate. And in the middle, someone with a well-oiled crossbow.
Geralt|Mhm. But I wasn't interested.
Dijkstra|Witcher! At last. Now, we're all present…
Roche|Mhm. And up the fucking creek. Why've you summoned us? Radovid's on his ship. We'll not get to him there, I've told you.
Dijkstra|Stop it. I've an idea how to draw him onto dry land.
Dijkstra|But all in due course. Let's start by confessing our sins. I let Philippa Eilhart in on our plan. Mea culpa.
Talar|Bravo. Bloody braaavo.
Dijkstra|Now, now. It's not a disaster. The lady sorceress is highly unlikely to warn the brat. What's more, she's willing to help us kill him. Naturally, it's nothing I'll ever agree to... But Phil, she's inspired me. Call her my muse.
Roche|Inspired you to do what?
Dijkstra|Patience. We've yet to get to the substance of the matter. Geralt… do I recall correctly that Radovid's hired you to find Philippa?
Geralt|You're nosy. Starting to piss me off, you know?
Dijkstra|I know. Forgive me, it comes with the job.
Geralt|No. You're not a spy anymore, remember? Chose the life of a criminal.
Dijkstra|No, that choice was made for me. Philippa forced me to flee Redania. Radovid prevented me from returning.
Talar|Dijkstra, infernally sad story, really fuckin' tugs at the heartstrings, but do you mind getting back to the matter at hand?
Dijkstra|Yes, right. Geralt, be so kind as to answer the question. He give you the contract or not?
Roche|The bridge must be clear.
Dijkstra|My lads'll make sure of that.
Talar|Guards round the temple - what about them? Won't they bloody congregate when they see the fightin'?
Dijkstra|If they're paid a tidy sum, they won't.
Talar|Ugh, well, the prick just popped our pumpkin.
Dijkstra|Ploughing neutrality.
Roche|Will you bloody tell us what this is about?
Dijkstra|Just as soon as Geralt arrives. Should he arrive.
Talar|If you won't ploughin' talk, least you can do is pour a round. Bloody suspense has made my throat dry.
<|endoftext|>
Philippa Eilhart|Eavesdropping on your conversation, naturally. With a good deal of interest… and a measure of wonder.
Geralt|Mind telling me what you found puzzling?
Philippa Eilhart|Your naiveté. Do you honestly believe Radovid will fall for such a crude ruse?
Geralt|Radovid's lost his mind. Doesn't think rationally anymore. That's why--
Philippa Eilhart|That is why he may very well choose to torture you, even if you brought me to him in chains. Just because.
Geralt|Philippa… Why even tell me this? Concerned about me that much?
Philippa Eilhart|Not at all. It's because I think it vital that Radovid die.
Philippa Eilhart|You don't want my help - more's the pity. But I shall do what I can to make certain you don't fuck it up.
Philippa Eilhart|Here. Take this.
Geralt|A ring… Redanian eagle etched in the ruby.
Philippa Eilhart|It belonged to Vizimir, Radovid's father. Hand him that, and he may believe you captured me. He might even choose to trust you.
Geralt|Helpful. Thanks.
Philippa Eilhart|Don't mention it. Believe me, I'm prepared to do much more to be rid of Radovid.
Philippa Eilhart|Good luck, Geralt. You'll need it.
Geralt|What's the catch?
Philippa Eilhart|There is none.
Geralt|Philippaaa… I know you too damn well. Always got a plan, always got at least two irons in the fire.
Philippa Eilhart|This time I shall be content with one - Radovid's head planted at its end.
Geralt|Might be tough to trick… but I think I'll manage.
Philippa Eilhart|Hm. I hope you will take a more serious approach to confronting the Wild Hunt… provided, of course, you survive long enough to undertake it.
Geralt|Philippa? What the hell're you doing here?
Philippa Eilhart|Geralt… Don't ask questions you know the answers to. It makes you look stupid.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|I'm a professional, got a reputation to uphold. Be stupid of me to come to you empty-handed.
Radovid|My father's ring… Philippa used it to stamp her decrees, then distribute them as the word of the king.
Radovid|Where is she?
Geralt|Under your nose, Sire. In Novigrad. In a house on the bridge leading to Temple Isle.
Radovid|Why haven't you brought her to me?
Geralt|Gotta capture someone to take them anywhere. All I did was track her down… then stole this ring as proof that I had.
Radovid|Do you fear her?
Geralt|No. You want to kill her yourself. With your own hands. I know this.
Radovid|You shall come with me. Hubrecht! Gather the men.
Redanian Soldier 01|How many, Sire?
Radovid|All of them.
Geralt|What others?
Radovid|Ah, you see, a rumor went around that I generously reward any who bring information about Eilhart. There's no shortage of the greedy and the stupid, so a queue quickly formed at the gangway to the ship.
Radovid|The first to board was a hunter. Brought me a dead owl with no eyes. He thought I'd believe it, shower him with gold. I had him blinded, then thrown overboard with a stone tied round his neck.
Radovid|The second was the postmaster from Oxenfurt. Claimed to have a letter she'd penned. It was forged, of course. I had his fingers cut off - he’ll never write again. Oh, and I took his tongue - the spoken lie is just as reprehensible.
Radovid|Needless to say the rest of the queue dispersed quickly.
Radovid|I hope you've brought something better than magic crystals this time.
Geralt|I know where she is.
Radovid|Perhaps… Or perhaps you seek to trick me. Like the others.
Geralt|Under your nose, Sire. In Novigrad. In a house on the bridge leading to Temple Isle.
Radovid|Proof, Geralt. Give me proof.
Geralt|Don't have any.
Radovid|To the dungeon with him.
Geralt|Wait! Don't have any proof, because I didn't want to scare her off. You want to kill her… with your own hands. I know this.
Radovid|Rarely do I take folk at their word. It is unwise. However, if what you say is true…
Redanian Soldier 02|Witcher Geralt… What do you want?
Geralt|An audience.
Geralt|Managed to learn something about Philippa Eilhart.
Redanian Soldier 02|I'll need your weapons. Now follow me.
Redanian Soldier 02|Your Majesty… The witcher. With news of Philippa Eilhart.
Radovid|Hm, you took your time… What is it?
Geralt|Got new information about Philippa Eilhart.
Geralt|Nothing just yet. Farewell.
Novigrad Guard 02|I've my orders - I'm not to let anyone in.
Geralt|You'll make an exception for me.
<|endoftext|>
Radovid|Well? Where is she? Where is Philippa?
Geralt|Like I said. House on the bridge. Closer to the other end.
Radovid|Close off this end, we need no guests, no innocent bystanders. Or witnesses.
Radovid|Damiaan, Jouke, Egbert, Freek, Caspar! You shall stay here, secure the rear…
Radovid|And kill the witcher.
Geralt|This how you reward those who serve you?
Radovid|It is how I punish those who irritate me.
Radovid|You know too much. You impede me too often. And I find your arrogance an annoyance.
Radovid|I've had men killed for less.
Radovid|Follow me!
Redanian Soldier 01|Any last words?
Redanian Soldier 01|Fuck…
Roche|Free the witcher! Then Radovid!
Geralt|You don't know where Philippa's hiding. Not exactly. Without me--
Radovid|Fret not. We will manage. Naturally, it would be easier with your help, but… you irritate me.
<|endoftext|>
Roche|How did she--?! Where?! Why?! How the fuck--?!
Geralt|Eavesdropped on us. Back at the warehouse.
Roche|What?! And you didn't think it worth mentioning?!
Ves|Lads… The time to discuss this is later.
Ves|Radovid is dead. It matters not by whose hand. Mission accomplished. Now let's get the hell away. Place'll be thick with Redanians in minutes.
Geralt|Let's go.
Geralt|We can discuss this later.
Geralt|Radovid's dead. Doesn't matter who killed him. Now let's get the hell out of here. Place'll be overrun by Redanians in minutes.
Radovid|Open up! I command you to open the door!
Philippa Eilhart|You needed merely to ask.
Radovid|Aaaaaaargh!
Radovid|Aaaaaaargh!
Philippa Eilhart|That settles the score…
Philippa Eilhart|And that was from the heart.
Philippa Eilhart|Forgive me… I could not deny myself the pleasure.
Radovid|Open up! I command you to open the door!
Philippa Eilhart|You needed merely to ask.
Radovid|Aaaaaaargh!
Radovid|Aaaaaaargh!
Philippa Eilhart|That settles the score…
Philippa Eilhart|And that was from the heart.
Philippa Eilhart|Forgive me… I could not deny myself the pleasure.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Can't let you kill them, Dijkstra.
Dijkstra|Aww, hard luck. Then you'll die with them.
Dijkstra|Kill them all.
Geralt|It's not my concern, so I should let you do what you will… But you're a real son of a bitch, you know that?
Dijkstra|It's why I'll make an excellent chancellor.
Dijkstra|Farewell, White Wolf.
Talar|Well? What? Is it done?
Roche|It's done. Though all did not go according to plan.
Roche|More on that later… First, a stiff drink. And a toast.
Roche|The North! Temeria!
Ves|Temeria!
Talar|Bloody Temeria!
Geralt|Temeria!
Geralt|Ugh… What now, Roche? A new guerilla campaign against the Black Ones?
Roche|No. The war just ended.
Geralt|How's that? There something I don't know about?
Talar|I'd say so. You see…
Talar|Tomorrow at noon, the commander of Army Group "Center" will sign a truce in Emhyr's name… A truce whose wordin' we agreed with Dijkstra.
Geralt|So back there in Velen, when the trolls nabbed you…
Talar|Yes, I was returnin' from the last round of talks. Emhyr will keep Aedirn and Lyria… But in exchange for Radovid's head and a stop to guerilla activities, he will withdraw from Temeria--
Roche|Which will become the empire's vassal state.
Talar|Self-ruled, internally! With its own courts, administrative structures and army!
Talar|The Silver Lilies will bloom 'neath the rays of the Great Sun. So I'd say were I a poet.
Talar|But I'm not, so all I'll say is there was no other fuckin' way.
Geralt|Haven't told me the whole truth.
Talar|You're right on that account… We know you're bloody allergic to politics, decided to emphasize mages and whatnot…
Dijkstra|If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well it were done quickly.
Dijkstra|That but this blow might be the be-all and end-all here.
Ves|What's that?
Dijkstra|Vakmeth, act one, scene seven. Always wanted to play that… never cast as anything but a halberdier.
Dijkstra|Geralt, what Thaler told you - put it out of your mind. There will be no truce with Nilfgaard. Redania, under my enlightened rule, will fight on until it wins. And when it does it will unite all the North. Including Temeria.
Talar|Wha… How? This is not what we ploughin' agreed!
Dijkstra|True. Instead, we insisted on one realm's questionable sovereignty. And to recover it, we gave Emhyr virtually all the north's other kingdoms. It was not a wise arrangement. So, no deal.
Roche|You two-faced whoreson… I will not allow this.
Dijkstra|Actually, you, Roche, should be the first to understand I've no choice.
Roche|Why the hell would I understand?
Dijkstra|Because you too are a patriot.
Dijkstra|Geralt - this doesn't concern you. You may go… Fare thee well on your Path or whatnot.
Roche|Meaning?
Geralt|Roche… You? In league with Nilfgaard?
Roche|I'm prepared to do anything for Temeria. Even whore myself out.
Geralt|You don't know Emhyr. He'll outwit you. Take your toys as if you were children.
Talar|Oh, don't you fret. We've heads on our shoulders, eyes all around. Take Dijkstra, for instance…
Geralt|Sure this isn't premature? Radovid's dead, but it's a long way from that to a free Temeria. War's not over, not even close.
Talar|You're mistaken.
Dijkstra|Kill the witcher!
Dijkstra|Fight, you dimwits!
Dijkstra|Fuck! Gotta do everything myself!
Dijkstra|Support! Run, get reinforcements!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Nilfgaardian regiment always accompany you on your walks?
Rosa Var Attre|Always. Papa's orders. "It's for your protection, Rosa, dear! People here hate us!" Why? What have I done to them? But enough about that. Soldier! You may leave!
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|But His Excellency Ambassador var Attre said that--
Rosa Var Attre|And this excellency is telling you otherwise! Do you not recognize him? This is Geralt of Rivia, the best swordsman the North has ever seen! I'm safe with him. Now march off! Quickly! Left, right, left, right!
Rosa Var Attre|Finally. Let's go, Geralt. I've something I wish to show you.
Geralt|We were supposed to train, not go for a walk--
Rosa Var Attre|I know, Geralt. Now stop harping on about it and let's go!
Geralt|You're using me. Don't like it one bit.
Rosa Var Attre|And I don't like lacy frills and Redanian novels, but you don't hear me complaining. Now follow me!
Rosa Var Attre|Geralt! Over here!
<|endoftext|>
Rosa Var Attre|Ow… Ow… Stop… I yield.
Geralt|You all right?
Rosa Var Attre|Yes. The only thing you've really hurt is my pride.
Geralt|All right. What's next?
Rosa Var Attre|We should return. Just… forgive me, Geralt, I know this might sound awkward, but would you mind turning around for a moment? My corset's shifted, it's pinching me terribly.
Geralt|I can understand a woman wanting to look pretty, but fighting in a corset? It slows you-- Rosa?
Geralt|Shit. She ran off. Anything happens to her, var Attre will kill me. Need to find her.
Geralt|By the way… how'd you get interested in fencing?
Rosa Var Attre|I was bored. I've no friends here. Papa keeps me on a short lead. It's banquet after banquet after banquet… I detest banquets.
Geralt|Mhm. Boring conversations, terrible food, and weak booze.
Rosa Var Attre|Exactly! At least with a sword in hand I can have some fun. You know, blow off steam.
Rosa Var Attre|Hah! Be grateful I'm no bruxa or alp. Else you would be dead already.
Geralt|Well done. Actually is something of a bruxa in the way you fight.
Rosa Var Attre|Perhaps I should have them call me that… the Black Bruxa? Black, because… you know… Nilfgaard.
Geralt|…
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Drunk 01|Far from home, aren't you, sweetie? And there's no telling if you'll ever get back.
Geralt|She's ambassador var Attre's daughter. She's got diplomatic immunity.
Novigrad Drunk 02|Don't really understand the shite you're saying. Though it's clear you love your Black Ones.
Novigrad Drunk 01|It's no surprise, Lucas. Witchers're drawn to monsters - just the way things are. But this beastie… Oh, we'll tend to her ourselves.
Geralt|Lemme rephrase, put it in words you'll understand. Piss. Off.
Novigrad Drunk 02|Well, well. It's not just Black Ones who'd tell us what do - it's witchers as well. Too bad I listen to neither. Get him, Lucas!
Geralt|Take the coin and go.
Novigrad Drunk 02|If you think you can buy us like some cheap whore--
Novigrad Drunk 01|Shut up, Lucas. Have you any idea what we can buy with this? We'll take your coin as war reparations for Nilfgaardian crimes.
Geralt|I believe you've offended the young lady. Now apologize. As nicely as you can.
Novigrad Drunk 01|F-forgive me, m'Lady. I… I am sorry.
Geralt|Your turn. Be nice like your friend. Bow low and go be a patriot somewhere else.
Novigrad Drunk 01|Inn't the miss sad, here all alone? Me and my friend could join you, tell you a jest or two.
Rosa Var Attre|A gallant gesture, but I must refuse.
Novigrad Drunk 02|Oi, Kobe… You heard her speak? Our lasses don't talk like that.
Novigrad Drunk 01|Aye, but Nilfgaardian ones do… Come to the wrong tavern, birdie. Black Ones aren't welcome here.
Rosa Var Attre|Get your filthy hands off me, you wretch!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Understand now why your father insists soldiers follow you around?
Rosa Var Attre|So they can save me. As you did.
Geralt|No. So you won't need saving to begin with. Rosa… those humans died because of you.
Rosa Var Attre|What of it? Do you expect me to shed a tear? Observe a minute of silence? They were dregs, they got they deserved!
Geralt|Lesson's over. Remember what you've learned today. Looks like you'll be using that sword often.
Rosa Var Attre|It's beyond me, Geralt, I don't understand you. Why concern yourself with the fate of two drunkards? The world would be a better place without--
Geralt|You should go home now. And take the shortest, not the scenic route.
Rosa Var Attre|I understand. Farewell, Geralt. And good luck on the Path.
Geralt|And you wonder why the locals hate Nilfgaard.
Rosa Var Attre|I thought you were different from other Nordlings. That you understand us, our sense of justice. I see I was wrong.
Rosa Var Attre|Lucas and Kobe… I shall remember those names. And when the emperor takes Novigrad, I will find them and have them pay.
Geralt|Easy. Didn't hurt you in the end.
Rosa Var Attre|They raised their hand against me. That's enough to have that hand lopped off.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|All right, let's open it.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Bloede glewynn!
Geralt|Vampire. Probably regenerates here.
Vampire Medic 02|Just five more minutes…
Vampire Medic 02|Is it 1358 yet?
Geralt|No…
Vampire Medic 02|Then fuck off.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Ugh, I'm ever running into things like that. Well, come on! Open it again!
Geralt|Why? See an elven manuscript there? 'Cause I sure as hell didn't.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|I hadn't the chance to look. Perhaps he enjoys bedtime reading and keeps it under his pillow?
Geralt|We should let him rest.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|But…
Geralt|It's better this way, trust me.
Geralt|Fine. I'll open it again.
Vampire Medic 02|What the-- again?! Do you fucking plan to come knocking once an hour now? Enough!
Geralt|Let's open it.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|If all goes well, I shall start on the prolegomena today. The jaws on those primates from the History Faculty will drop to the ground.
Geralt|No. I'm sick of elves and their secrets.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Oh! Your specialization in the subject as well?
Geralt|Yeah, sorta.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|We're due to hold a conference about the White Fleet soon, if you'd like to prepare a paper…
Geralt|No chance. See ya.
Geralt|Shouldn't have disturbed him.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|You needn't read the manuscript! Just open the sarcophagus, then be on your merry way.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Help me, this damned lid won't budge!
Geralt|Whoever put it on the sarcophagus was clearly thinking about grave robbers.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Ehhh… You've no idea who I am, have you?
Geralt|None.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Professor Vairmont Jonne, Oxenfurt University, Faculty of Applied Archaeology.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|As a certain ancient map would have it, there's a priceless elven tome in this sarcophagus - the Dar'Ah Manuscript.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|It could shed entirely new light on the Aen Elle-Aen Seidhe conflict. So, will you help?
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Come now, don't make me beg. I must speak to the vampire.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What's the problem?
Novigrad Trader 03|Fuck, another nonhuman! You're everywhere!
Novigrad Guard 01|Silence! Now we'll do this quick. I've got a little witcher chore - you willin'?
Geralt|Little chores aren't usually worth the pay.
Novigrad Guard 01|Well this will be, don't you fret. Now just be quick about it - I've wasted enough time on these two pricks.
Novigrad Guard 01|They share a warehouse. Monster's cropped up in it…
Dwarf Man 02|Cropped up? On its own? You put it there! You meant it to rip me noodle off, so you could get your paws on me goods!
Novigrad Trader 03|Don't try to spin this, shorty!
Novigrad Guard 01|I don't care who sicced a ghoul or a striga on who! Beast's gotta be dealt with - that's that.
Novigrad Guard 01|So, what'll it be, witcher?
Geralt|Fine. I'll see to it.
Novigrad Trader 03|I'll not have it! Nonhumans - they stick together!
Novigrad Trader 03|These two're like to prove it's no ghoul at all, but my dear departed nan!
Dwarf Man 02|I didnae get a good look at the mug, but now you mention it, it could very well be--
Novigrad Guard 01|Shut it! Or I'll send inspectors to your storehouse just as soon as the monster's dispatched!
Novigrad Trader 03|That won't be necessary.
Geralt|Sorry. Not interested.
Novigrad Trader 03|Nonhuman - o' course! You always stick together! He might've discovered I was right, but now--
Novigrad Guard 01|Now the captain'll decide what to do with yous. I've had it. Let's go!
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Guard 01|So? You take care of the beast?
Geralt|Yes.
Novigrad Guard 01|I knew hiring a witcher'd be quickest. So - figure out how it got in there?
Geralt|You hired me to kill the beast, not investigate.
Novigrad Guard 01|Fair enough. It's just I'll still have to muck around in the matter. I'd have paid extra not to. Here. This is for you…
Novigrad Guard 01|… and we’ll go to the garrison, talk to the captain. He can try to get to the bottom of this.
Geralt|Found a cage. Someone'd kept a nekker in it. Bars had been sawed through, though.
Novigrad Guard 01|So someone wanted it to escape. Which one of 'em did it?
Geralt|Found no evidence pointing either way…
Novigrad Guard 01|Hah, no one wants evidence. If neither confesses, we'll lock 'em both up for obstructing a Guard investigation.
Novigrad Guard 01|Thanks for your help. Here's your pay. C'mon!
Geralt|Think it was the dwarf.
Dwarf Man 02|What? Rubbish! Tripe! Why the hell would I do that?
Geralt|Seems plausible this racist got under your skin…
Dwarf Man 02|But…
Novigrad Guard 01|That's enough. Here's your pay. And you - come with me.
Novigrad Trader 03|Can't wait to watch him swing. Someone'll have to lift him onto the stool.
Geralt|I think it was the man. Hates nonhumans, purest motive in the world to get rid of the dwarf.
Novigrad Trader 03|Wha-? What motive? The scabrous freaks are colluding against me!
Novigrad Guard 01|Sure they are. You can tell me all about it from inside your cell.
Dwarf Man 02|Prick finally got his comeuppance. I'll buy his stock for coppers on the crown.
Geralt|Why'd he even do business with you if he hates dwarves so much?
Dwarf Man 02|Aach, he only talks tough. Wasn't at all prejudiced against dwarven coin.
Geralt|So why'd he try to kill you?
Dwarf Man 02|Him? Bah. That fool could never plan somethin' like this. Too watery between the ears.
Dwarf Man 02|So long, witcher!
Geralt|Not yet.
Novigrad Trader 03|What you been doin' in there? We're not payin' you by the hour, like some dockside whore. Hurry up! Chop, chop!
Novigrad Guard 01|Keep out of this. The witcher'll be paid from the coffers of the Temple Guard. Just as soon as he kills the monster…
Novigrad Guard 01|So don't be fussy, just tell me what you think.
<|endoftext|>
Dwarf Man 02|Hey, mate, someone invite you here?
Geralt|No. Followed a trail. Of human blood.
Dwarf Man 01|So you found our pal Derrick? Well, well, must have a good eye. After our little, well, fallin' out, I spent half a day lookin' for 'im. And all I got outta it was a stroll and some dog shit on my shoes. Soiled me finest poulaines - snake skin, take a gander!
Dwarf Man 02|What're ye gabbin' for? Cleaver said it clear - anyone finds our den, chib 'im 'tween the ribs and drop 'im in the gutter.
Dwarf Man 01|Think, Grun. Just once, use your fuckin' melon. If the witcher's found the body, he's found the key, too. Can't open the drop box without the key. We don't open the drop box, Cleaver don't get what he ordered. Cleaver don't get what he ordered, he gets angry. You want that? Didn't think so.
Dwarf Man 01|So, er… hark your ear, mate. You got two options. First - give us the key. I pay you for your trouble, and everyone goes their own way smilin'. Second - make a fuss, and we do what Grun wants. Chib between your ribs.
Geralt|Fine. Here's the key, now gimme some gold.
Dwarf Man 01|Ah, see that, Grun? Kindness works atimes. Pleasure doin' business with ye, chum. Now piss off.
Geralt|Don't have any key.
Dwarf Man 02|Argh. Wanted to do the right thing by you. As a nonhuman to a witcher. But fine - a no is a no.
Geralt|Two things only the greatest fools do: throw stones at hornets' nests… and threaten a witcher.
<|endoftext|>
Redanian Soldier 01|Where you think you're goin', mucka?
Geralt|Why do you even care?
Redanian Soldier 02|You're in a military operations zone. And our job's to collect the war tax.
Geralt|Look more like you're collecting for a round of vodka to me.
Redanian Soldier 02|I wonder, I do… Will you be that cheeky when we accuse you of spyin'? Now shut your trap and pay!
Geralt|Fine, I'll pay.
Redanian Soldier 01|That I understand. Exemplary patriotism, mate.
Geralt|Not about to give you a copper.
Redanian Soldier 02|Told you he was a spy. We're gonna arrest you in the name of good King Radovid!
Geralt|You can always try.
Redanian Officer 01|What's going on here?
Redanian Soldier 02|Reporting the capture of a suspicious individual, sir! A spy!
Redanian Officer 01|A witcher'd make as good a spy as you'd make a chaperone.
Redanian Officer 01|I catch you extorting coin again, you'll go straight to the front. The eastern front.
Redanian Officer 01|And you, witcher - best give these parts a wide berth.
Geralt|Thanks, farewell.
Geralt|This keeps happening, I'll end up funding Radovid's new infantry division.
Redanian Soldier 02|Don't you fret. Gods'll reward your patriotism.
Geralt|Already paid. Once is enough.
Redanian Soldier 01|Spy. Let's arrest him.
Redanian Soldier 02|Halt! You gotta pay the war levy!
Geralt|This again?
Redanian Soldier 01|Shut it and pay.
<|endoftext|>
Redanian Soldier 01|Hey, spy! Remember us?!
Geralt|Ah, greedy and greedier. Ever get to drink that vodka?
Redanian Soldier 02|Officer made us clean the latrines. 'Twere your doin'.
Redanian Soldier 01|You got to pay for that.
Geralt|Ahh… From the moment we first met, I knew I'd have to kick your asses someday.
Redanian Soldier 01|At him!
Geralt|About face! And back to the latrines, get cleaning.
Redanian Soldier 02|Yes, sir!
Redanian Soldier 01|For glory! For Radovid!
Geralt|Here. Take this coin, buy yourselves some vodka, and knock one back to my health.
Redanian Soldier 01|Think you can buy your way out of this?
Redanian Soldier 02|Clamp it shut. We'll take the coin.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What happened?
Novigrad Prostitute 02|Islanders, from Skellige… They've taken over Crippled Kate's.
Geralt|"Taken over"? How's that?
Novigrad Prostitute 02|Clobbered the innkeep, tossed out the girls, then set to drinkin'… They've been goin' since yesterday, apparently celebratin' some big loot…
Geralt|Yeah, sounds like Skelligers…
Novigrad Prostitute 02|But you look to be an honest man. Help us. Drive away the hooligans. We've not much, but it'll make a tidy sum if we all pitch in.
Geralt|Ugh, fine. See what I can do.
Novigrad Prostitute 02|Really? So there are good men left in the world.
Geralt|They'll stay a few days, maybe two weeks, drink all there is to drink, then leave. Without my doing a thing.
Novigrad Prostitute 02|You've no heart, no conscience! No surprise, though, don't know what I expected from the likes of you.
Novigrad Prostitute 02|You're back… Changed your mind? Will you drive off them Skellige roughnecks?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Don't have time to go back and forth on this. Let's do this quick: man to man.
Skellige Warrior 01|Do what, dammit? Whatcha wanna do man to man with me? Invitin' me into the alcove?
Geralt|No, pea brain. Challenging you to a duel. I win, you take your mates and get outta here.
Skellige Warrior 01|Ahh, why didn't you say so?! I'm always up for smackin' a man about the gills.
Geralt|That wrath of yours didn't do squat against the Ice Giant. My sword was more effective.
Skellige Warrior 01|Wait… you're… Geralt of Rivia? The one went to Undvik with young an Craite?
Geralt|In the flesh.
Skellige Warrior 01|Ah, that's another kettle o' fish… When a friend asks, a Skelliger never refuses.
Skellige Warrior 01|Gents, our time's come! Geralt the Giant Slayer's got need of this inn!
Geralt|I'm not going anywhere, but you are. If not, I'll carry you out… right after I knock you unconscious.
Skellige Warrior 01|Ye threatenin' me? Me?! Know who I am?! Yormund of Faroe!
Geralt|Never heard of you.
Skellige Warrior 01|Bleedin' Continental rats… Oy, mates, c'mere! This pipsqueak's lookin' to get his gob walloped!
Geralt|Collect your friends and go. On your best behavior, now.
Skellige Warrior 01|Uhhh…. Aye. Gents, time to go!
Geralt|Well, don't let me disturb you, then. Enjoy yourselves.
Skellige Warrior 01|Ah, thank ye, thank ye! Lookie that, decent men to be found even in this arsedump of a city!
Skellige Warrior 01|Sorry, mate, gotta fill your horn elsewhere. This establishment's part o' Skellige today!
Geralt|Seems to me we're still in Novigrad. And in Novigrad, Novigrad rules apply. Rules you happen to be breaking.
Skellige Warrior 01|Just how's that? Ye not allowed to drink in peace? Have a bit o' fun? Leg it, man, afore you taste the wrath of a Skelliger.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|A wolf head? I know this place. They held the first Trials of the Grasses here, before they built the fortress…
Geralt|Almost washed away. A few more decades and it'll be gone… Just like the witchers.
Geralt|A place where monster slayers were created… now infested with monsters. Near dripping with irony.
Geralt|Mutations were carried out here… Nice acoustics. Kids' screams must've carried far.
Geralt|Table for mutations… Like our Sad Albert, except even sadder.
Geralt|That smell… mutagens. Makes me wanna vomit despite the years.
Geralt|The lab… Where they brewed the potions. Poisons, more like.
Geralt|Prepared the herbs here. Corn lily, nightshade, wolfsbane… Nature's finest.
Geralt|A vat for seeping the herbs. I remember those teas they gave us…
Geralt|Some contraption… Broken.
Geralt|No idea what this was for… Maybe that's for the better.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|It's cold… unnaturally cold.
Geralt|Medallion's jumping. Boulder must be saturated with magic.
Geralt|Boulders form a triangle… affecting the magic aura. Thing is, who arranged them? Couldn't 'ave been Lambert…
Geralt|That smell… Some herb grew here.
Geralt|Dried needles. Juniper… or thuja.
Geralt|Seeds… Wolfsbane, I think.
Geralt|A rust-eaten sickle.
Geralt|Herb garden… probably cultivated by the mage in residence at Kaer Morhen. His magic made it a greenhouse… For a time.
Geralt|Could try to tune these stones… No point without some instructions, though.
Geralt|Mage's notes… Language is a bit archaic, but still intelligible.
Geralt|Mhm… Gotta hit two stones with Igni, and one with Aard. Piece of cake.
Geralt|Whoa-ho… Someone's clearly unhappy with the change in aura.
Geralt|It's gotten warm… Very warm. Even exotic herbs could grow in this temperature.
Geralt|Hey, hey. Got ourselves a botanical garden.
Geralt|Should glance at these papers…
Geralt|That didn't work.
Geralt|Maybe the mage left some instructions behind…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Took a lot of trouble to hide this passage behind an illusion.
Geralt|"Monstrum, or a Portrayal of Witchers."
Geralt|Somebody's notes on the first page.
Geralt|Notes describe how to open a passage in the mine.
Geralt|Might be worth seeing what's down there.
Geralt|An iron mine. Depleted centuries ago.
Geralt|Something behind these roots…
Geralt|An elemental. Summoned by a mage and left as a sentry.
Geralt|Notes say I gotta place the book in the right spot…
Geralt|Medallion's humming - there's magic here.
Geralt|No ordinary forge. Medallion's sensing magic.
Geralt|Oughta look around.
Geralt|Fire's out. Let's see what's behind the hearth.
Geralt|A secret compartment, behind an illusion.
Geralt|Hm… a blacksmith's bellows.
<|endoftext|>
Fire Elemental|Stand down.
Fire Elemental|Begone! This place belongs to Radmir.
Geralt|Listen, just wanna look around.
Fire Elemental|Intruder! I cannot allow this!
Fire Elemental|I will not allow it!
Fire Elemental|NO! NOT ALLOWED!
Geralt|Radmir of Tor Carnedd? He was flayed alive during Falka's rebellion. A long time ago, that.
Fire Elemental|You lie!
Geralt|Who are you?
Fire Elemental|I am fire, this forge's soul. I am the flame that tempers steel.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|You're a long way from Ofier.
Hakland Merchant|A long way and with dangers fraught. But in our homeland they say, "In risk there is honor."
Geralt|Got a ring to it. Not true in my experience, though. Face plenty of risks. Honor - not so much.
Hakland Merchant|Because risk issues from intent - important is this intent! The long passage I braved to admire the unknown and bring glory to myself and my liege.
Hakland Merchant|The world we must explore, virgin lands discover, new knowledge garner among our brothers then to spread. For is there in life a beauty greater than to admire the new, to stand in awe of the never-ending creation of the world?
Geralt|That mean I've landed in a camp of explorers and philosophers?
Hakland Merchant|Indeed. Your customs we come to observe, knowledge to exchange, and goods, naturally, to trade.
Geralt|Heard a lot of good things about Ofieri mares, their speed. Care to race?
Hakland Merchant|Hmhmha. Swift as the western winds are our mounts. To prove this would be an honor. So race we must!
Geralt|Care to race again?
Hakland Merchant|A pure pleasure it would be!
Geralt|Quite the mount you've got.
Hakland Merchant|Ah yes, a loyal friend I have in Babiyetza. And she is wiser than many a man.
Hakland Merchant|Countless races we have won together.
Geralt|So, an explorer and a jockey in one.
Hakland Merchant|From where I come, small children ride, and not a gathering is by a horse race not crowned.
Geralt|What'd you bring from Ofier? Mind if I have a look?
Hakland Merchant|Our craftsmen's goods, you see worth in them?
Geralt|Quite a bit, I'd say.
Hakland Merchant|Ah, these are nothing compared to what I could offer had I not lost my prized diagrams.
Geralt|How'd you lose them?
Hakland Merchant|To thieves. In our travels, I and my companions surprise attacked by local ruffians were. The diagrams, their loss, I bemoan not so much as I do one of my comrades, killed in the violence.
Geralt|See if I can't find your diagrams, recover them for you.
Hakland Merchant|These instructions when followed produce items worthy of a king.
Geralt|Tell me where you were attacked. Remember?
Hakland Merchant|A crossroads, not far. Forgive me, for this area I know poorly. Detailed directions I cannot provide. North of the spot stood a residence, a near ruin.
Geralt|Should be able to find it.
Geralt|Sounds like a real loss. Sorry.
Hakland Merchant|I might have been more cautious. Should you encounter the diagrams, return them, and thankful I shall be.
Hakland Merchant|Duplicates I will make, with markings your craftsmen understand. A gift for you.
Geralt|I'll keep that in mind.
Geralt|Your homeland - be glad to hear some tales about it if you've got the time.
Hakland Merchant|If time you have. For of my home I could speak until your ears withered and your legs failed you.
Hakland Merchant|What here they call Ofier in truth is many diverse polities and peoples.
Hakland Merchant|A land it is of vast steppes, mountains forbidding, lakes clear as crystal and wild lands untouched.
Hakland Merchant|A land of fallen empires, kingdoms at their peak and tribes that know no monarchs yet remember in myth a time when the world was young.
Geralt|You call any of these lands home?
Hakland Merchant|Yes, a town with towers to make Nilfgaard weep with envy. Of philosophers, doctors, mathematicians and mages an enclave. But about these last you should my friend interrogate, for one among them is he - a runewright.
Geralt|I'll make it a point to talk to him.
Geralt|Take care, now.
Hakland Merchant|Go and in the world glory. Its never-ending creation be praised. Farewell.
Geralt|You won, congratulations. And you were right all along - Ofieri mares are swift as the wind.
Hakland Merchant|Our myths tell of a time when love brought together the skies and the steppe. And from their union was born the first mare.
Hakland Merchant|Weak were the creatures called men, they fell prey to countless dangers. The mare nursed them, her milk fed them. Strong they grew, and she let them saddle her. Warriors they became and gave fight to their foes.
Hakland Merchant|The myths teach us to respect our horses, noblest among all beasts.
Geralt|Beautiful story. Thanks… for that and the race.
Geralt|Ofieri mares may be swift as the wind, not quite as fast as my Roach, though.
Hakland Merchant|I congratulate you! A saddle for your mount your reward, our contest to commemorate. It will make you a rider even swifter.
Geralt|Thanks. Like your new gear, Roach?
Hakland Merchant|Hah! Much may be said of a man by how he treats his horse.
Hakland Merchant|It is, to see you again, quite the pleasure.
Hakland Merchant|All four recover and a reward shall be yours. Duplicates I will make, with markings your craftsmen understand.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|No promises… but I can certainly look for him. Any distinguishing features? How will I recognize him?
Gnome Man 01|Hrm, got to think on that… Well, he's a halfling, as I am. Light hair… Will that do?
Geralt|It'll have to. So long.
Geralt|Sorry… No time for this now. Things change, I'll come see you again.
Geralt|Here about the contract.
Gnome Man 01|Phew… A taker, at long last! Poverty on everyone's lips, but when you've a job to give, no one's eager! Folk're lazy, that's the truth of it!
Geralt|Stick to the point. If you don't mind.
Gnome Man 01|Right, right… Sorry for the chatter. I'm anxious, is all. Been so long without any word… ehh.
Gnome Man 01|It's my apprentice, Folkert. I sent him to the Deadwight Wood - you know, the forest near Martin Feuille's farmstead. I'd run out of han fiber, see, and the damned stuff grows thick as weeds there…
Geralt|Lemme guess - hasn't returned.
Gnome Man 01|Yes-- No-- He hasn't. Please, find him. And bring him back, safe and sound.
Gnome Man 01|So? What'll it be, eh? Will you look for Folkert or not?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Looking for someone named Folkert. Light-haired halfling. Ring any bells?
Cannibal Old Woman|Aye, saw a little one 'round here. Out pickin' herbs.
Geralt|Mhm… Till he got hurt. Ran across a trail of blood. Trail led me here.
Cannibal Old Woman|Tis just as you say! Wolves had attacked him, he fled here seekin' shelter. I told him, "Back to your city, young master, plenty such dangers hereabouts." But the fool were stubborn, said he had to pick his blooms aforehand.
Cannibal Old Woman|Ventured back into the woods… and that were the last of him. Heard howlin' that night, sent shivers down me spine.
Geralt|So where're his remains? Wolves would've left something - his boots, maybe.
Cannibal Old Man|Didn't go lookin'. We's too old to go trampin' about in the woods.
Geralt|Blood stains in the hut next door - know anything about that?
Cannibal Old Woman|Aye, 'course. Judd guts game in there.
Geralt|In someone else's hut?
Cannibal Old Woman|None live there no more, see? And workin' 'neath a roof, it's more pleasant, civilized. Rain don't whip and sun don't blind.
Cannibal Old Man|But why poke your nose in there to start with?
Cannibal Old Man|Do better to give an old couple some peace!
Cannibal Old Man|You know what happened to the Folkert fellow! My woman told you!
Geralt|What is this place, exactly?
Cannibal Old Woman|A village. Plain to see.
Geralt|Abandoned huts is about all I see.
Cannibal Old Woman|Aye, it's only us now. Young folk're gone off to the city, seekin' work. And the old've all died. Ain't that right, Judd?
Cannibal Old Man|Right as rain.
Geralt|So long.
Cannibal Old Woman|Judd! Sharp, now! We've company!
Cannibal Old Woman|What's brought you to these parts, master? Lost your way?
Geralt|Could say that.
Cannibal Old Woman|Oh no, master, better to stick to the high road 'round here! These're wild lands. Wild and dangerous!
Geralt|No. Looking for someone.
Cannibal Old Woman|Ahh…! Do tell! Perhaps we can help!
Cannibal Old Woman|You again? Well, out with it, what brings you here?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Been to your larder. Meat-rich diet - that what you like?
Cannibal Old Woman|Master, not at all, 't'ain't like tha--
Geralt|Best hope not. Or you'll be next to get a hook through your neck.
Cannibal Old Man|The wolves killed him! Him and the others. We but gather the bodies! That's the truth!
Cannibal Old Woman|We're old and frail, we've no strength to plough or sow. But we gotta eat. Have pity, master!
Geralt|Vow never to eat another bite of human flesh… and I'll let you live.
Cannibal Old Woman|Oh, I swear, swear it on dear Mother Melitele! On the Eternal Fire! On--
Geralt|Keep the gods out of it. Swear on your heads. Which I will take if you break your vow.
Cannibal Old Man|A-aye. We swear.
Geralt|You live in the middle of nowhere. It's out of my way. But I'll be back. Better believe I'll be back.
Geralt|Folk say we witchers have no feelings. It's a barefaced lie.
Geralt|Right now, I feel rage. And I can't wait to vent.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Folkert, your apprentice - I know what happened to him.
Gnome Man 01|Out with it! I've gone near daft with worry!
Geralt|Found some witnesses. Claim wolves attacked him. He survived at first, then went back in the woods to harvest more herbs… His luck ran out.
Gnome Man 01|Ah… A treasure, that lad - dutiful, mannered. Such a shame. Well, here's your gold. I trust it will serve you well.
Geralt|He was-- Agh, really no gentle way to put this. Cannibals ate him.
Gnome Man 01|Cannibals? A short ride from Novigrad? In Velen, that would be one thing, but… but here? Gods!
Gnome Man 01|You slew them, right? Tell me you killed them!
Geralt|Hired me to find out what happened to Folkert. Never mentioned murder.
Gnome Man 01|But one will happen, soon. You want naught to do with it, that is your right. But I aim to round up folk who still give a damn.
Geralt|It's a couple of old folks. Doubt they'll put up a fight.
Gnome Man 01|All the better. Now, I wager you want your coin, eh? Take it. And get out of my sight.
Geralt|I did.
Gnome Man 01|He's been avenged - there's that. Eh, your coin. Take it and… and now please be on your way. I must write to Folkert's parents.
Geralt|Ran into trouble, a freak event.
Gnome Man 01|Of what type? Did monsters attack him?
Geralt|Mhm. Could say that.

Tax Collector|Halt! You there! Please wait! You're Geralt of Rivia, are you not?
Geralt|Depends who's asking.
Tax Collector|Revenue and Customs for Occupied Temeria, Dorian branch. Represented by yours truly, Deputy Tax Enumerator Walthemor Mitty.
Geralt|Honored, I guess. What seems to be the problem?
Tax Collector|In brief, undeclared income.
Geralt|Scuse me?
Tax Collector|We've had reports, numerous, that over the last months you've come into a great deal of coin - quickly. So quickly it's raised suspicions.
Geralt|I get how that might've happened. Be glad to clear them up.
Tax Collector|Profession?
Geralt|Witcher. Monster slayer.
Tax Collector|Mhm… Sole proprietorship, service sector. Type of services rendered: rat/pest/monster removal.
Tax Collector|Moving on. Have you at any time engaged in the wholesale trade of rawhide in the White Orchard area?
Geralt|This some kind of joke? 'Course not.
Tax Collector|Right… next. During the current fiscal year, have you engaged in the acquisition of bivalves with the express intention of selling the pearls therein?
Geralt|Even if I have, what's wrong with that?
Tax Collector|Article 86, section 3 of the Tax Code: "Whosever purchases goods at an unseemly low price to take advantage of the seller's ignorance, shall be subject to a fine equaling two hundred percent of the earnings from any such a transaction." Sound familiar?
Tax Collector|And now, please answer. Have you, or have you not, dealt in said pearls?
Geralt|No, never done anything of the sort. Witcher's honor.
Tax Collector|Now, for the final question. Have you ever unlawfully acquired another man's movable goods, chattels?
Geralt|Hmmm. Meaning?
Tax Collector|Agh. Meaning, have you ever waltzed into someone's home and taken something without their permission?
Geralt|Gotta be kidding! The witchers' code forbids it!
Tax Collector|I'm pleased to hear you abide by your guild's by-laws.
Tax Collector|Now, if you could wait for one moment… Compare column B to Table VII, apply the rate for confirmed, childless bachelors, a tax credit of seven-point-three percent for practitioners of hazardous professions…
Tax Collector|It adds up… to the crown! I say, good sir, you are exceptionally upstanding!
Geralt|It'd be rude to disagree.
Tax Collector|In these times, such civic virtue is a rarity. It must be commended, rewarded. Here.
Geralt|Wha… what's this?
Tax Collector|A diploma. I bestow on you the title of Taxpayer in Good Standing. I'd suggest you frame it, hang it in a place of honor. Congratulations!
Tax Collector|And done. Here.
Geralt|What's this?
Tax Collector|A summons to pay back taxes. Please report to the Vivaldi Bank with this document posthaste.
Geralt|But-- But I've never paid any taxes, not one copper!
Tax Collector|Precisely! Yet you've had the obligation always! Thus the arrears! I advise you well - do not treat this matter lightly!
Geralt|Ugh. Paper pushers.
Geralt|A couple times… But the owners never protested.
Tax Collector|In the eyes of the law that is no excuse, my good man!
Geralt|Yeah, unfortunately, on occasion. But I didn't know it was illegal.
Tax Collector|"Ignorantia legis non excusat," as the ancient Vrans would say. Ignorance of the law excuses no one!
Geralt|Might've… once or twice. Definitely no more than three times.
Tax Collector|And did you then file a WIPT-30/c form with the Revenue and Customs office for your place of residence? No? As I thought!
Geralt|Don't you have anything better to do?
Tax Collector|Not at the moment. Make no mistake, you cannot evade this. You must answer my questions, promptly and in full.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Footprints… uneven. Someone ran through here.
Geralt|Crossbow bolt… and footprints - deep. Shooter must've been wearing heavy armor.
Geralt|Smells of… Huh, they were cooking fisstech. Took most of the equipment. Only left what was broken.
Geralt|Scar on his forehead. Must be Kluivert.
Geralt|Bolt in the back. Went in deep, so a close range shot. From the village, or that direction, looks like.
Geralt|What do we have here? Bolt in the back. Went in deep, so a close range shot. Seems it came from the village, or that general direction.
Geralt|True as true can be. Dangerous trade, narcotics.
Geralt|Flaming rose on a red field. Who would've thunk.
Geralt|Flaming rose on a red field. Knights've found a new pastime.
Geralt|Hoof prints. Leading towards the hill. Someone's still there.
Geralt|Stopped here for a second, hid, then ran on.
Geralt|Open window. Boot print on the bed. Somebody was in a hurry.
Geralt|Something bad happened here…
Geralt|Cut down with a sword. Swollen, red nose - snorted any fisstech lately?
Geralt|*Sniff* Smells like… solutions, reagents. Wonder what's cooking.
Geralt|Tracks lead in that direction…
<|endoftext|>
Olgierd Bandit Female 02|Hey you! Puss Peepers!
Geralt|Name's Geralt.
Olgierd Bandit Female 02|But I'm gonna call you Puss Peepers. That a problem?
Geralt|Get to the point.
Olgierd Bandit Female 02|Got an offer. Potentially lucrative, Puss Peepers. Someone's killed my mate. Name was Kluivert. You're to figure out who did it. Then cut the bugger's head off.
Geralt|Keep talking.
Olgierd Bandit Female 02|Kluivert dealt fisstech. A few days past he rode to Bowdon - to take a delivery. Never came back.
Geralt|Been there? Actually seen his corpse?
Olgierd Bandit Female 02|No, but Kluivert was one damned reliable whoreson. We was to meet, he didn't show. Can only mean he's dead.
Olgierd Bandit Female 02|Find the bastard who did this. Find him and kill him. I'll pay top coin.
Geralt|Need to think it through.
Olgierd Bandit Female 02|Kluivert's got a scar on his forehead not unlike yours. Spot that, you'll know it's his body.
Geralt|Said I'd think about it.
Olgierd Bandit Female 02|Know what, Puss Peeps? One look at a bloke and I know what he's made of. You'll do what I ask. I'd bet anythin' on it.
Olgierd Bandit Female 02|Look for me in Oxenfurt! The Alchemy Inn on the main square!
Geralt|I'm a witcher. Not a man hunter.
Olgierd Bandit Female 02|Kill an awful lot of them, though, don't you?
Geralt|When they deserve it.
Olgierd Bandit Female 02|And my friend's murderer - he don't deserve it? At least hear me out!
Geralt|Why not avenge him yourself? Seems like you all relish swinging your sabers.
Olgierd Bandit Female 02|Aye, we do. And if I knew who'd axed Kluivert, I'd 'ave gutted him ages ago. Thing is, I don't.
Olgierd Bandit Female 02|But you see a lot with them puss peepers. You'll track him down.
Geralt|Avenged your friend.
Olgierd Bandit Female 02|Hahahaha! I knew you'd succeed, Puss Peepers! I knew it!
Olgierd Bandit Female 02|Go on, out with it - who was the bastard?
Geralt|Bastards. Brethren of the Order of the Flaming Rose.
Olgierd Bandit Female 02|What'd you do to 'em? Scald 'em with hot irons? Pick out their eyes? Skin 'em alive?
Geralt|No. Just killed them.
Olgierd Bandit Female 02|Agh… So handsome and so borin'. Here, Puss Peeps - your gold. Ought to be enough for an ounce of panache.
Geralt|Came to collect my coin, not tell tales.
Olgierd Bandit Female 02|Oh, prefer not to be badgered just now.
Olgierd Bandit Female 02|You're a right good chap, Puss Peepers.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Wondering what you got inside. 'Cause it reeks of fisstech to me. Mind if I have a look… brethren?
Rogue Knight Weak 01|Aye, we'd mind. Very much so.
Rogue Knight Strong  02|Enough o' these games. I'm countin' to three and you're gonna be gone when I'm done, got it? One. Two.
Geralt|Three.
Geralt|Got a better idea. You're all gonna count to a hundred. Got it?
Rogue Knight Strong  02|Three, four, five, six…
Geralt|Great start. Now step aside.
Geralt|How would you like to count to a larger number? Using Novigrad crowns. That strike your fancy?
Rogue Knight Strong  02|Well… yeah, what do I care? Go on in.
Geralt|I was never here.
Geralt|Don't like your tone, brother.
Rogue Knight Strong  02|Odd. See, I thought I was bein' polite. But if courtesy don't work, we'll try somethin' else.
Geralt|What's this? Order of the Flaming Rose have a new seat? Not too shabby…
Rogue Knight Strong  02|You listen, vagrant. Don't know why you're here, but take my advice - go back to wherever you come from.
Rogue Knight Weak 01|So? Why're you still standin' there? I need to smash your pate in?
Rogue Knight Strong  02|Lookin' for trouble, are you?
Rogue Knight Strong  02|Seven, eight, nine, ten…
Rogue Knight Weak 01|Eleven…
Rogue Knight Strong  02|Twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen…
Rogue Knight Weak 01|Eighteen, nineteen…
Rogue Knight Strong  02|Tenteen…
Rogue Knight Weak 01|You mean twenty, idiot. Twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four…
Rogue Knight Strong  02|Twenty-five…
Rogue Knight Weak 01|Twenty-six…
Rogue Knight Strong  02|Twenty-seven…
Rogue Knight Weak 01|Twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty…
Rogue Knight Strong  02|Thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-three…
Rogue Knight Weak 01|Thirty-four, thirty-five, thirty-six, thirty-seven…
Rogue Knight Strong  02|Thirty-eight, thirty-nine…
Rogue Knight Strong  02|Forty, forty-one, forty-two, forty-three, forty-four…
Rogue Knight Weak 01|Forty-five…
Rogue Knight Strong  02|Forty-six, forty-seven, forty-eight, forty-nine…
Rogue Knight Strong  02|Fifty. Ugh…
Rogue Knight Weak 01|Fifty-one, fifty-two, fifty-three, fifty-four, fifty-five…
Rogue Knight Weak 01|Fifty-six, fifty-seven, fifty-eight, fifty-nine…
Rogue Knight Strong  02|And sixty. Sixty-one, sixty-two, sixty-three, sixty-four…
Rogue Knight Strong  02|Sixty-five, sixty-six, sixty-seven, sixty-eight, sixty-nine…
Rogue Knight Weak 01|And seventy. Seventy-one, seventy-two, seventy-three, seventy-four…
Rogue Knight Weak 01|Seventy-five, seventy-six, seventy-seven, seventy-eight…
Rogue Knight Weak 01|Seventy-nine, eighty, eighty-one, two, three…
Rogue Knight Strong  02|Gads, eighty-fuckin'-four, eighty-fuckin'-five…
Rogue Knight Weak 01|Eighty-six…
Rogue Knight Strong  02|Eighty-seven…
Rogue Knight Weak 01|Eighty-eight…
Rogue Knight Strong  02|Eighty-nine, ninety and ninety-one…
Rogue Knight Strong  02|Ninety-two, ninety-three, ninety-four…
Rogue Knight Weak 01|Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven…
Rogue Knight Strong  02|Ninety-eight. Ninety-nine…
Rogue Knight Strong  02|A hundred.
Rogue Knight Weak 01|One fucking hundred.
Rogue Knight Strong  02|What now?
Rogue Knight Weak 01|No fuckin' clue, brother.
Rogue Knight Strong  02|Lippy fucker! Get him!
Rogue Knight Strong  02|Errrr…
Rogue Knight Weak 01|Uhhh…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Honestly? Couldn't give a shit about your grief. Not the tiniest, runniest, greenest little shit in the world.
Geralt|You persecuted others, destroyed them. Now you've met with that same fate. So, you got exactly what you deserved.
Rogue Knight Leader|A witcher-moralist. Amusing. But… feel I've met you somewhere before.
Rogue Knight Leader|I know you. You're Geralt of Rivia. Jacques de Aldersberg's killer.
Geralt|None other. And if I had to go back, I'd do it again.
Rogue Knight Leader|That was the start of our downfall. You were the beginning, accursed mutant! Draw your blade.
Geralt|No need to yell. Just ask, politely.
Rogue Knight Leader|Bloody hell? Who the devil are you?
Geralt|I'm a witcher. Or, as your brethren prefer to call me - a "mutant," a "freak."
Rogue Knight Leader|You shouldn't be in here.
Geralt|And the Order of the Flaming Rose shouldn't be brewing narcotics.
Rogue Knight Leader|True, we shouldn't. We're supposed to defend the downtrodden. Spread faith in the Eternal Fire.
Rogue Knight Leader|But Radovid tricked us. He broke his oath, sent our brethren to the front as common grunts. And once the mighty Order was bled dry, he disbanded us.
Rogue Knight Leader|Took our lands, confiscated our demesnes to finance his war. The brethren who didn't object were appointed mage hunters. Those who took umbrage, dared to stand up to him, they were imprisoned or exiled.
Rogue Knight Leader|We're but a handful who still wear the colors. And we must find a new place in this world.
Geralt|So you turned rogue. That your idea? Wonder what Siegfried of Denesle would say.
Rogue Knight Leader|Siegfried of Denesle would-- But how do you even--?
Geralt|What can I say? You've done well. Before long you'll be another Salamandra. Congratulations. I'm outta here.
Rogue Knight Leader|Salamandra? Wait, wait…
Geralt|And knights of the Flaming Rose shouldn't be murdering humans. Or producing drugs.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Painite's too rare to just find it lying around. Need to go to Novigrad, ask the right merchants.
Geralt|Apparently, likely to find some small jade deposits north-east of Novigrad.
Geralt|Oughta try my luck there.
Geralt|Jade. Now to extract some.
Geralt|Deposit's too meager. Gotta find another.
Geralt|Not much jade here. Need to keep looking.
Geralt|No painite here. Need to ask someone else.
Geralt|Damn painite. Looks like I gotta try another merchant.
Geralt|Didn't have any painite, either. Try my luck with other traders, I guess.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|That oughta do.
Geralt|Tree on the sign. Must be the house.
Geralt|Need to go around.
Geralt|Hm, not here.
Geralt|Nothing here.
Geralt|Ah, just like she said.
Geralt|Under the rose bush… all right.
Geralt|So, noise is coming from here.
Geralt|No sign of monsters or grave robbers… Bit of a mess, that's all.
Geralt|Maybe this isn't the spot after all. Strange.
Geralt|Suspiciously loud for a cemetery at night.
Geralt|Dammit! More fighting… Noise is coming from the catacombs, it seems.
Geralt|Deeper in the catacombs… Right, let's go.
Geralt|Place Margot mentioned.
Geralt|Well, that's done.
Geralt|Removed the urn with Margot's ashes. Just like you wanted. Louis? You there?
Geralt|Medallion's humming. Something's not quite right.
Geralt|So where's the grave? Under a chestnut, or so Margot claimed.
Geralt|"Micheline Belrose." This is it.
Geralt|Loud enough to wake the dead.
Geralt|"Private Chamber - The Right Honorable Members of the Gwent Friendship Society of Beauclair." This is it.
Geralt|Lanzano… might be worth talking to.
Geralt|Sign with a tree on it, eh? Well, let's look around.
Geralt|Chamber Louis mentioned, gotta be.
Geralt|Right. High time Margot paid up.
Geralt|Aaaand the gwent cards. As promised.
Geralt|Made a hell of a lot of noise. Someone willing to pay me for resolving the problem?
Geralt|Shoulda known he'd stand me up. All right, if that's how you want to play it…
<|endoftext|>
Margot Ghost|"Thus spake the prophet Lebioda: Thou shalt not play for coin."
Louis Ghost|After which he promptly added, "For you shall have none left for me!"
Margot Ghost|Heretic! Shut your mouth! I shall speak to you no more!
Louis Ghost|No, no! It is I who shall speak to you no more, you old tart!
Geralt|Mind keeping it down? Neighbors're complaining.
Louis Ghost|Neighbors? Everyone here is dead.
Margot Ghost|I know not your name, but you must help me! I refuse to spend eternity at the side of this heathen! Remove him from my crypt at once!
Geralt|Slow down. What's the problem?
Louis Ghost|This is my crypt! And this saintly shrew harangues me, even in death! An eternity of nagging - the misery!
Margot Ghost|I was blind and a fool to marry him! He's a slave to the cards, prepared to wager his own child on a round of gwent!
Louis Ghost|Once, dammit! And as a jest! How many times must I explain?! And who sank our fortune into some silly statue of Lebioda?!
Margot Ghost|Piety! That was my cause! The prophet immortalized would have transformed this land of blasphemy and betting! How was I to know it was all a fraud?!
Louis Ghost|Because I warned you?! Some five hundred times?!
Geralt|Quiet! Shut up! Both of you!
Geralt|Look, if there's to be peace and quiet here, one of you's gotta go. Need to move one of you out.
Margot Ghost|Yes, take him! Please! Do so, and I shall… I shall tell you where I hid his lucky gwent cards.
Louis Ghost|What?! I knew it was you! And now you would evict me from my crypt, then pay for the deed with my cards?!
Louis Ghost|Blast it all! Had I those very cards at the tournament in Belhaven, I'd still be alive! It's your fault, you pox incarnate, that they stabbed me to death!
Margot Ghost|They murdered you for your debts, I had nothing to do with it!
Louis Ghost|Come, why heed this Good Book-thumping wench? Mind, I know well where she hid those cards. I'll tell you myself - as soon as you've removed her.
Geralt|Hm. Need to think about it.
Geralt|Who does the crypt belong to? Rightfully.
Louis Ghost|Must you ask? It's mine, my family's, the de Corentins'. Are you illiterate?
Margot Ghost|True, but my dowry served to repurchase it from those you owed.
Geralt|What's this argument about, anyway?
Louis Ghost|Sod off! Not your concern!
Geralt|Could help you resolve it.
Margot Ghost|You'd rather lie about all day, flipping those cards like some… some dwarf! Disgusting! Ptooey!
Louis Ghost|Indeed! Far better to stand at the door of Lebioda's temple, mumbling prayers from dawn till dusk!
Margot Ghost|Ingrate! I prayed for you! That you would cast off the yoke of gambling!
Louis Ghost|Fine job you did of it! Seems the gods had also heard enough of your cackling! And you! Why are you here? This is a private conversation!
Louis Ghost|I shall speak to no one as long as she is in here. Take her away.
Margot Ghost|My apologies, but I'm simply not in the mood.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Smashed padlock. Someone broke in.
Geralt|Grave's dug up… Thing is, grave robbers don't usually wail and moan that much.
Geralt|Tracks…?
Geralt|Trampled grass and… hm, bloomers? Not the kind of moaning he meant, though.
Geralt|Lots of tracks. Not much I can glean from them, though.
Geralt|Strange. Can't hear anything now…
Geralt|Empty wine bottles, leftovers… Big to-do? Not likely…
Geralt|Gotta come back after dark.
Geralt|Can't hear anything, but might want to look around anyway.
Geralt|Hm. Might be noisy, but doubt they're the source of the sounds in question.
Geralt|Bloomers? Yeah, romantic as all hell here.
Geralt|Noises could be coming from grave robbers. Can't know for sure, though. Need to wait till after dusk, to confirm.
Geralt|Grave robbers usually try to keep quiet, but who knows. Need to look around.
<|endoftext|>
Louis Ghost|Please, put me back! Yes, I'm a fraud, I lied to you, I've no notion where the cards are… but… but I shall think of something, just wait…
Louis Ghost|Got it! A swordsmith - Trentin's the name. I skinned him at gwent once, but he had no coin so he promised me the pride of his collection - a lovely blade, finely fashioned. I passed on before I could get it, but you could collect it in my stead. Just tell him Louis de Corentin sent you.
Geralt|The dead Louis de Corentin?
Louis Ghost|Hm, hm, that could indeed prove problematic… but if--
Louis Ghost|I know! The man's a gambler, inveterate. His wife forced him to seek help - hypnosis or some such. She believes Trentin no longer touches cards, would wager her virtue on it. Were she to learn he still plays gwent, well, he'd be in a deep doodloo.
Geralt|Hm. Thanks.
Louis Ghost|Ahhh, peace at last.
Louis Ghost|I see you fell for that pious tart's drivel. Drats. Ah well, then listen, I've a request. Be a good fellow and set me in the chamber of the Gwent Friendship Society of Beauclair. It's just round the corner.
Geralt|You a member?
Louis Ghost|That's just it, I was not. But I would have dearly liked to have been… and joining them in death shouldn't bother anyone.
Geralt|Certainly doesn't bother me. I'll do it. Where's this chamber?
Louis Ghost|Ah, once you enter the catacombs, go straight. The chamber will be on your right, near the corridor's mouth. And I thank you.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Done. Now where you got those cards?
Margot Ghost|Leave the city through the Coopers' Gate, then veer right. Our house is easily recognized - a tree adorns the sign above the door. I buried the chest in the garden, beneath the rose bush.
Geralt|Tree on a sign, rose bush - think I got it.
Margot Ghost|Might I ask… what you did with Louis? True, he knew nothing in life but gwent, but I would still prefer he not spend eternity in a ditch or a privy.
Geralt|Don't worry about it. Found him a nice place. Oughta feel right at home. Farewell.
Margot Ghost|Lebioda, forget'st not my husband, though he be an incorrigible sinner.
Margot Ghost|No, wait! Ah. If you truly must do this, then please, at the least, deposit me somewhere pleasant.
Geralt|All the same to me. Where do you wanna go?
Margot Ghost|Take me to my mother's grave. It's in the old cemetery, just outside the city walls. A lovely spot, almost on the lakeshore. The flora there - it's extraordinary, really.
Geralt|Hm, extraordinary flora. Where is it exactly?
Margot Ghost|Beneath the outspread arms of a chestnut. The tombstone bears my mother's name - Micheline Belrose. To think I failed to heed her when she warned me about that lout…
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Blacksmith 01|That's rich! De Corentin's dead. Who are you? His brother? His lover? Louis never mentioned either.
Geralt|Maybe so, but he told me a bit about you. Heard you used to play a little gwent, had a habit, in fact, till your wife helped you kick the addiction. Real treasure, wife like that.
Toussaint Blacksmith 01|Argh, the bumpoke! Ehh, here I thought I might hang it over the mantle again, with Louis gnawing radishes from the underside. But it seems I must…
Toussaint Blacksmith 01|So be it, the sword's yours. Uh, but don't leave me high and dry. Give me a chance to win back my dignity, at least. Perhaps a round or three for coin?
Geralt|What about the wife? Not afraid she'll--?
Toussaint Blacksmith 01|In my home, what I say stands. Women've got no power. Besides which the wife's away for a few days visiting her sister in Belhaven. So, shall we play?
Geralt|All right. Convinced me. Lay 'em out.
Geralt|No thanks. Think I'll pass this time.
Toussaint Blacksmith 01|Bumbotch. But a no's a no. I'll not insist nor beg. Your loss.
Geralt|Take care, now.
Geralt|Here to collect Louis de Corentin's sword.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Hrrrrmm… Hrmmm… Ugh, quiet down, now, shhh…
Geralt|Noises at the cemetery - you the one they bother?
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Yes, yes! And I'm alone in that, it seems! That is, no one else has bothered to take any steps, though all must hear the racket.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|I took the matter up with the Ducal Guard. They claim they found nothing, but I'm not sure they even bothered to look. What's left for me to do? Should I sniff about the cemetery myself?
Geralt|Fine. I'll tend to it. Any victims, someone go missing recently? Or are we just talking noises?
Toussaint Noble Man 01|No one's come to harm, thank the gods. Why, do you think it might be a monster?
Geralt|Could be, but doesn't need to, though. Might also be grave robbers, tramps. Remains to be seen.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|I can't rightly say what would be worse. Whatever the case, gods speed, master!
Geralt|How much'll I get for this?
Toussaint Noble Man 01|How much… Yaaawn… would you like?
Geralt|The noises - they pretty regular?
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Each night! I live next door, I hear it loud and clear. As if through a horn someone had stuck in my ear.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|"Arrghh! Haaaawk! Whoooo! Feeeeeerrkk!", and then WHAAACK! THUD! As if a mother bear slammed pate-first into a cupboard.
Geralt|Know exactly what you mean.
Geralt|Sorry, can't help you.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Then why the devils bother me at all? Argh.
Geralt|I am. Don't think I've seen your notice, though.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Not to fret. I shall tell you, and perhaps you'd care to help - not free of charge, naturally. The din at the city cemetery - that's my grief.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Screaming and clattering fill the air at night. A man can't get a lick of sleep. It all began on the day of Saint Zoatham's Remembrance. I recall it precisely.
Geralt|Hey there, I'm done. Cemetery oughta be real nice and quiet now.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Ahh, to sleep in my own bed once more! The Clogs has grown intolerably loud. The punters bellow like men possessed!
Toussaint Noble Man 01|One madman especially - always shouting "Odrin, Ooodrin!" But tell me, at the cemetery, what was it? Beasts, as you claimed?
Geralt|Nope. Just a marital spat.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|That's it? But they hollered like skewered polecats. Hrmph, sorry to bother you with such a trifle. Here, for your trouble.
Geralt|Thanks.
Geralt|Yeah. Really tough, demanding fight. Barely made it out alive.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Is it your codex? Forbids you from revealing the details? For the best, I daresay. There's a small premium for you. You've earned it.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Hrrrmmm… Wha--? Oh. It's you.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Conscience been gnawing at you? Have you decided to help with the ruckus at the cemetery after all?
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Wh-wha? Wha's gwin' on?
Geralt|Pretty crap idea, sleeping at the Clogs. Unless you don't mind some clever little beast making off with your coin pouch.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Ah… the notice, is that it? Are you a witcher, master?
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Sooo? Done with the job? Nooo? Then lemme be…
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Ahhh, calm and quiet, at last.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|What?! Much too much!
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Hm, I don't believe I have that amount… What would you say to a festival discount? On account of the… uhh… tourney?
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Agreed!
Toussaint Noble Man 01|You must be off your noggin! Thoroughly!
Geralt|Took care of it.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Truly? The howling's gone? For good? Wonderful. Ah, to sleep in my own bed again, at long last!
Toussaint Noble Man 01|But, but… what was it? Some ancient filth entombed deep in the catacombs?
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Whose notion of order is this? Why doesn't someone do something?
Geralt|What's this about?
Toussaint Noble Man 01|You return.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|And? Is it done?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Smashed. As if someone threw it against the wall.
Geralt|Hmm. Gold. Can't be grave robbers. None worth their salt would've left this.
Geralt|Pretty fresh. Funeral wasn't too long ago.
Geralt|Louis de Corentin - "…died on the day of Saint Zoatham's Remembrance."
Geralt|Hmm, noises started right around then.
Geralt|"Here lies Margot de Corentin."
Geralt|"Louis de Corentin. Raise your sighs to the Prophet Lebioda on his behalf."
Geralt|"Sir Conan of Braye End. Died of over titillation while witnessing an act of unicornipositusphilia." Interesting - but not what I'm looking for.
Geralt|"Here lies Pablo Diego José Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno María…" - yeah, that's not it.
Geralt|Not a soul. Strange.
Geralt|Doesn't look anything like a grave hag's lair, either.
Geralt|All right. Gotta move one of them out.
Geralt|Noise is clearly coming from that tomb. Impossible.
Geralt|Hm, something's not right. Need to hide, see how things play out…
Geralt|Right, dark now. Where could I hide…?
Geralt|Behind this statue, maybe…?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Do my damndest to get your fiancé back safe and sound. Just, uh… mind telling me where to look for him?
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|I forget you come from afar and do not know our land. They say Grottore has its lair in the caves at the foot of the Gorgon Hills.
Geralt|That close to the city? Telling me no bold souls've ventured out to defeat the beast?
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Quite the contrary, plenty have. But none's returned. My concern is well-founded!
Geralt|I see. All right… High time I set off.
Geralt|Rarely my wont to turn down a damsel in distress… even less so when there's a, ahem, prize involved.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Ah! Naturally! Why, you, sir, are no knight errant, but a guildsman, an expert. How much would you need?
Geralt|This Grottore - know anything else about it, mademoiselle? Judging by the name, guessing it lives in a cave.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Yes… From which it prowls when hungry. By night, when all are asleep, it creeps into villages. Then, of a sudden, breaks open shutters, reaches inside and snatches babes from their cradles so quickly they've not the time to yelp!
Geralt|Hmm… Nocturnal, long prehensile arms, intelligent…
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|François claimed he would cut the filth down in a snap, but he's been gone so long… Will you help, sir? I cannot sleep, I fear this worrying will be the death of me…
Geralt|Not saying no… but I gotta think about it.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Ah, master. Will… will you help?
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|My eyes were not deceived! Yet - so far south?! You, sir, of all folk, in all your fame.
Geralt|Mhm. Me… south, in all my fame.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Ach! I've heard so much! Why, when Master Dandelion tarried in Beauclair, not a day passed without him baying out a ballad in admiration of your deeds.
Geralt|Ahem… Yeah, unwelcome little habit of his. But… what can I do for you?
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Ahh. You see, my betrothed, François le Goff, vowed, in my honor, to bring me the head of the horrid beast they call Grottore!
Geralt|Mgh. Couldn't 'ave gotten you a bouquet… some sweets in a bag?
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Witcher, sir, you jest! A love most true demands proof through heroic deeds dedicated to the heart's captor!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|But alas… François has been gone a fortnight. Thus I must plead with you to see what's become of him. Could you? Would you?
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Master, forgive me, but you ask much too much!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|A few crowns less, master, a fistful. I beg you so.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Yes. That amount I am prepared to pay.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Master, take no offence, I beg you… but clearly I am in no position to meet your expectation. I offer what I can, yet if it is insufficient to your mind, a must ask another's help.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Wouldn't happen to need any help, would you?
Toussaint Knight 02|Hm, I-I don't know… After all, I did swear a solemn oath to…
Geralt|Deposit the beast's head at your beloved's feet. No mention of you killing it all by yourself, though.
Toussaint Knight 02|Hm… all in all… I suppose you are right! Whew… We must fight side by side, then! For honor!
Geralt|Leave you to it, then.
Toussaint Knight 02|Ahem… Right. Onward.
Toussaint Knight 02|For hoooonoooooor!!!
Geralt|Dammit… Should follow the guy. Least I'll be able to tell the fiancée what happened.
Geralt|Be willing to help you… just not this instant.
Geralt|Name's Geralt. No crest, no motto, no plumed helmet, even. I'm a witcher.
Geralt|Mind telling me why you're here?
Toussaint Knight 02|For the head of Grottore, the monster from yon cave. I swore on my honor I would bring it to my betrothed, mounted on a pike.
Geralt|Mhm. Made any progress?
Toussaint Knight 02|I've… mh-hmm… been gathering my strength. I shall attack soon. I gave my word, and my word is my honor!
Geralt|François le Goff, I presume. Your betrothed sent me. See, you've been gone a while, so you've got her worried.
Toussaint Knight 02|I-- Well, indeed, for… for Grottore is a most fearsome beast! I must prepare properly for battle!
Geralt|Takes two weeks, that?
Toussaint Knight 02|I have tarried a bit, true. But the delay is done! My word I gave, thus the beast shall die!
Geralt|Mh, by napping outside the cave? For a fortnight?
Geralt|Geralt of Rivia. Crest of the Bridge. Hail and well met.
Geralt|Ravix of Fourhorn. My crest shows a maiden sitting astride a… striding bear.
Geralt|So, now that we've had our knight-to-knight chat…
Toussaint Knight 02|Zzzzzzz…
Geralt|Ahem.
Toussaint Knight 02|Huh? Ooph… You scared me half to death, drifter!
Toussaint Knight 02|What do they call you? What's your crest? Speak!
Toussaint Knight 02|Hold, master! A beast lurks in there!
Geralt|Right, expected as much, 'cause I--
Toussaint Knight 02|Tshshshsh! Quiet, before you wake it! Come, I've camped nearby. We shall talk there.
Geralt|You still here?
Toussaint Knight 02|I… I was about to forge forth…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Hm. Strange. No sign of Grottore.
Toussaint Knight 02|Perhaps we should turn back? If there's no beast, there's no beast. Damn shame, but we tried…
Geralt|Not so fast. Let's take a look around.
Geralt|Impressive. You'd think you were in a winter garden.
Geralt|Bones… Small skull, fontanel's not completely closed. An infant, about a year, maybe.
Toussaint Knight 02|They speak the truth about the villages. Grottore consumes babes.
Geralt|Various sundries, some tools… Grottore must've taken them from its victims.
Geralt|Clear as day, now. Spriggan, gotta be. Seems to be off somewhere, probably feeding. Need to lure it.
Toussaint Knight 02|Ugh. Very well. To work, then. Gods, thy will be done!
Geralt|Dead. Branches crushed his bones and internal organs. No sign of the monster. Hid, maybe?
Geralt|Burning bright and warm.
Geralt|Decided to say hello, have you.
Geralt|Cradle filled with children's shoes. Doubt I've ever seen a collection this grotesque.
Geralt|Dammit! Knight got ambushed.
Geralt|Bones… human. Hollow inside. Marrow's been sucked out.
Geralt|Rusty armor - all that remains of the last thrill-seeker to make it out here.
Geralt|Something on the other side… Can't hope to get through. Neither sword nor Signs will cut this.
Geralt|Better see what happened to the knight.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|High time you returned to Beauclair, brave knight.
Toussaint Knight 02|Nay, oh nay. The head of this beast is a trifle, wholly inadequate to express the love I harbor for my betrothed.
Toussaint Knight 02|The world awaits! Ahem. To honor her, I shall cut down another, more terrible beast!
Geralt|Take my advice - grab the damned head and cut the shit.
Toussaint Knight 02|I beg your pardon! That I wish to make my beloved's name known the world over, to bring her glo--
Geralt|Shut up and listen. Crests, scrap metal armor, swooning damsels - all that's nothing to do with hunting monsters. Which is work, damn hard, dangerous and thankless work - that you're just not cut out for.
Geralt|Find some other way to prove your valor. Only thing you've proven so far is that you're a fool.
Toussaint Knight 02|You do not mince words, master. In Toussaint one might demand satisfaction upon trampled ground for a lesser slight.
Toussaint Knight 02|Yet… there is truth in what you say, I cannot deny. I survived with my life by a hair. It is time… time I returned home.
Geralt|Wanna prove your valor? Go back to your betrothed and be honest, tell her you're not ready to marry.
Toussaint Knight 02|You are blind to my predicament. Once I return, I will have no recourse. She will drag me to the nearest shrine, while--
Geralt|Uh, can't say I see it happening, your success. But do what you will. And good luck.
Toussaint Knight 02|My thanks, master. To fight at your side was an honor.
Geralt|Mhh… Must have really cold feet. Frozen.
Geralt|Why the challenge? Couldn’t 'ave gone after a something less formidable? A werebbubb, for instance?
Toussaint Knight 02|Why? For… for the beast must match in ferocity the very ardor of my affection, and…
Geralt|You're blushing, sir knight.
Toussaint Knight 02|Agh… It's my betrothed. The thing is, she champs at the bit to get married, when we've not known one another but two years!
Toussaint Knight 02|So I vowed to slay Grottore. Thought it would buy me time. To battle such a beast, why, it could take months…
Geralt|Mhm. Especially at the rate you were going…
Toussaint Knight 02|Ughh… Ooph… By my troth, the damned brute was sturdy!
Toussaint Knight 02|I… I'm grateful, witcher. You aided me greatly.
Toussaint Knight 02|Please, you must accept this trifle… as a token of my gratitude.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Afraid I've got bad news… Sir le Goff fell in combat.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Oh… Just as I had feared! He was so terribly courageous, bold to the point of being rash! He'd have done anything for me!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Gran always said true love must end in true tragedy… It seems she was right.
Geralt|So… um… about my reward - didn't manage to save his life, true, but I did--
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Re-- reward?! I mourn the loss of the love of my life, yet you-- The gall! Take your gold! And choke on it!
Geralt|Sorry for your loss… Farewell.
Geralt|Good news. Your betrothed--
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Is my betrothed no more.
Geralt|What?
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|He was just here, just departed. Having made a new vow - this time to fetch me a striped horse from Zerrikania!
Geralt|Well… least he chose something he stands to accomplish on his own. Quite the trek, though…
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Precisely! I told him I require no more proof! Let us make haste to the temple! He began hemming and hawing, babbling about honor and whatnot…
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Grrr… Tell me, master witcher - are all men swine?
Geralt|Not all. A few exceptions out there.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Agh… Perhaps in your distant Rivia.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|But what care have you for my heart's woes… Your reward, as I vowed. And advice should you ever find yourself a lady witcher - be truthful with her to save the world some grief.
Geralt|Good chunk of them, I'm afraid.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Agh… I should have donned a priestess' robe.
Geralt|Got good news, mademoi--
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|As do I! François has returned! We marry in a week's time! Hahaha!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Prenuptial teachings at the temple tomorrow, dress fitting the next morn, then a tour of the wedding venue. I have never been so happy!
Geralt|Hm. Congratulations, I guess. Wish you happiness, both of you.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|And good fortune to you on your Path! Your reward, master! And godspeed!
Geralt|Hm. Not sure these nuptials are a great idea…
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|What?! I beg your pardon?!
Geralt|Young maser le Goff… Well, he wasn't exactly raring to get hitched. Seems to me you two should re--
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Well, I never! The nerve! Not another word! Take your coin and leave us be!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Actually does bleed. Looks like human blood, too. And the bark - resembles hypertrophic scars in places.
Geralt|Medallion's humming like crazy. Intense magic at work here.
Geralt|Hut looks inhabited… No sign of the dweller, though. Guess I'll look around.
Geralt|Dammit, where the hell's Jacob? Wouldn't abandon the tree of his own free will. Need to find him.
Geralt|Dammit… Witch wasn't lying when she said we'd never meet again.
Geralt|Gotta get back to the tree, lift the curse.
Geralt|A hut. The witch's.
Geralt|Should check on Jacob.
Geralt|Gareth's remains. Witch must've tossed them in there.
Geralt|Must be Gareth's remains.
Geralt|Look your last to the world's four winds.
Geralt|From the south, not a word.
Geralt|From the east, no cry is heard.
Geralt|From the north, silence sighs.
Geralt|From the west peer hollow eyes.
Geralt|Cease your vigil - dead he lies.
Geralt|A knight's plate armor and some bones. Gareth's remains? These them?
Geralt|Wonder why the armor came apart. Magic, or he just fall from a height?
Geralt|Morholt? Where's your ma-- Dammit!
Geralt|Fresh blood and clear, deep prints.
Geralt|Looks like Jacob fled chased by… his dog.
Geralt|Skeleton, bits of some old armor. Wonder who it was.
Geralt|Blood. Seeped from the direction of the tree judging by the shape of the stain.
Geralt|Logger was making good time. Strange, though - willow's isolated, no other trees near it.
Geralt|Piece of silk fabric, a bit of trimming. Hem of a dress, probably.
Geralt|Must be really old.
Geralt|Swear I hear sobs in the rustling leaves.
Geralt|Dammit… Got it wrong. Run!
Geralt|The world about you lives, endures.
Geralt|Light rushes in on the southern breeze.
Geralt|Upon the north wind, winter's clouds roll in.
Geralt|Midst the winds of the west your name sings and spins.
Geralt|Daphne, rise, live again among men!
Geralt|On fall's eastern winds - summer's reprise.
Geralt|Not attacking. Doesn't mean it's not a threat, though.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|You Jacob?
Jacob Lumberjack|Heel, Morholt, down. Who asks?
Geralt|A witcher. Saw your notice.
Jacob Lumberjack|Hold up. A witcher, you say? Like in Luis Herrera's "Tales and Fables"? Luckier than a green-bleeding leprechaun, I am!
Jacob Lumberjack|See, not a soul around believes this tree is Daphne, the cursed lady of legend. But you - you could lift the curse!
Geralt|So what makes you think there's a girl cursed inside the tree?
Jacob Lumberjack|Well… I came out with my dog Morholt to cut her down . Axe in hand, a broad swing I took. The edge burrowed deep in her trunk. And bumbotch me if blood didn't spurt forth!
Jacob Lumberjack|My jaw dropped in the dirt - but right then I knew! Every jot of it in the tale of Daphne, Gareth and the Witch of Lynx Crag!
Geralt|Don't tell me - from Herrera's "Tales and Fables."
Jacob Lumberjack|You porking bet! Second edition, amended, in octavo. I know those tales by heart, my nan read them to put me to sleep!
Geralt|Guess she read it cover to cover, colophon included.
Geralt|Willing to help, but first I gotta figure out where to start.
Jacob Lumberjack|No need. I know it all.
Jacob Lumberjack|Miss Daphne and Sir Gareth shared a terrible and fearsome love for each other. Yet to prove himself worthy of her hand, Gareth was to face the witch of Lynx Crag.
Jacob Lumberjack|Before Sir Gareth set off for the hill, Miss Daphne gave him her kerchief, a token of her favor.
Geralt|Lemme guess - he never returned.
Jacob Lumberjack|He did not. She stood here, day upon day, night upon night, trying to spy him.
Geralt|Till she sprouted roots and turned into a tree? Wonder why--
Jacob Lumberjack|I will fecking tell you why - to await the moment when Gareth returns, kerchief in hand! That is the power of love, the power of longing…
Jacob Lumberjack|So you must scale Lynx Crag, search there for a means to free Daphne! I will give you my book of tales to refer to… And good luck, witcher.
Geralt|Lemme take a look at the tree.
Jacob Lumberjack|Careful, now!
Geralt|My help doesn't come free, you know.
Jacob Lumberjack|You speak to a lowly woodcutter. No stench of coin about me.
Geralt|Got me curious, gotta admit. You really think the old tales're true.
Jacob Lumberjack|Taking the wee-pee, are you? Do you think me barmy?
Geralt|No. It's just these're dark, grim times. No room for knights pure of heart or happily-ever-afters. So I don't often run into folk like you.
Jacob Lumberjack|Yes, true, the times are crudpie. But I see this as all the more reason to remember the tales.
Jacob Lumberjack|My gran would say, "If you know not what to do, think to the Chessboard Knight and Noble Alondra - and the path they would choose."
Jacob Lumberjack|She schooled me so thorough in it, I could not do otherwise even if I wished to.
Geralt|Interesting case, can't deny it. But I just don't have the time.
Jacob Lumberjack|You'll be back, witcher. In Herrera's tales you witchers always return.
Geralt|Bit too old to believe in bedtime stories, aren't you?
Jacob Lumberjack|Want your chops busted, witcher? How old I am, that is none of your porking concern.
Geralt|Fair point - not my business what you believe, either.
Jacob Lumberjack|Huh. I'm content we see eye to eye.
Geralt|Always chat with 'em before you chop 'em down?
Jacob Lumberjack|Fee fi fo fum, a bleeding jester has come! I'll set my hound on you, you bum rag…
Geralt|Whoa, there. Just curious why you were talking to a tree. But all in all, not my concern.
Jacob Lumberjack|Wait. Hold, now. My dander's up, true, for scoundrels come and laugh at me. But you, you're, uh… well, just what the demon are you?
Geralt|A witcher. Name's Geralt. So, folk laugh at you because…?
Jacob Lumberjack|Stay with me a bit longer, Lady Daphne.
Jacob Lumberjack|So? Have you time to help Daphne now?
Jacob Lumberjack|Head to the top of Lynx Crag. And good luck.
Jacob Lumberjack|Gods be bumpoked, you must hang on, m'Lady!
Jacob Lumberjack|I cannot pay that much . I do not have that much.
Jacob Lumberjack|Lower, you must go lower. Willing I am to pay, but I've not near that much.
Jacob Lumberjack|Agreed. I will pay - as soon as the young maid is free.
Jacob Lumberjack|I have never even seen this much.
Jacob Lumberjack|Right lucky thing you showed up.
Jacob Lumberjack|So? Have you scaled Lynx Crag yet? Know what to do?
Geralt|Getting to it now. I'm ready.
Jacob Lumberjack|And? Did you look at the tree, close?
Geralt|Mhm. Actually does bleed. Pretty incredible. Looks… wondrous.
Jacob Lumberjack|Did I not say so?
Jacob Lumberjack|Well? What did you learn?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|*Sniff* Wormwood, sulfur, wort… Scent's fresh.
Geralt|Helmet… Used as a mortar for grinding seeds.
Geralt|Must've paid a small fortune for this armor. Didn't save him from death, though.
Geralt|Warm… Smell's inconclusive. No idea what ingredients're in there.
Geralt|Bones ground into dust.
Geralt|Wildcat hide. A panther's.
Geralt|"Liber Ivonis" - Conclave of Mages banned this tome.
Geralt|Notes on the use of yarrow stems. Interesting.
Geralt|"The Art of Body Transformation."
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Hmm. A wall of spell enhancements. Or trophies.
Geralt|Arrow, broken in half. No doubt to bring bad luck to the archer.
Geralt|Branch off a grapevine. Could be to ensure a good harvest, or a bad one.
Geralt|Doll looks like an accessory… for casting curses.
Geralt|Silk kerchief, monogrammed "D.F." Hm, could use it to break the curse if it's Daphne's.
Lynx Rock Witch|None but feral cats stray in here most oft, yet it seems I've a guest, from afar, at that. What do you seek in my home?
Geralt|Already found it.
Lynx Rock Witch|You do not aim to lift the curse from the tree girl, do you?
Geralt|What if I do?
Lynx Rock Witch|Then you had best know you waste your time.
Lynx Rock Witch|The old tales - did your nan not tell them to you? Even I, the witch of Lynx Crag, would be hard pressed to overcome the power of love and longing.
Geralt|I'll handle the curse myself, without your help.
Lynx Rock Witch|Go right ahead. I wish you luck.
Geralt|Letting me go? Just like that?
Lynx Rock Witch|I could not have devised a better ending for this little tale.
Lynx Rock Witch|Our visit is done. Adieu, for never shall we meet again.
Geralt|What if I asked you nicely? To lift the curse, please.
Lynx Rock Witch|Gareth met the fate he deserved, and what happened to his wench was not my fault.
Geralt|All right, so you didn't cast the curse. But could you help lift it?
Lynx Rock Witch|I probably could. But why ever would I?
Geralt|I'll humble myself, prostrate myself before you like the Gareth of the tale did.
Geralt|I beseech you to help me. Lift the curse that imprisoned Daphne in the tree.
Lynx Rock Witch|When I saw you enter my hut, I thought, "Now there is a fellow who shall bend his neck for no one."
Lynx Rock Witch|Stand.
Lynx Rock Witch|None, not even I, can restore to the lass the years she has lost, can erase the suffering she has endured.
Lynx Rock Witch|We cannot bring her back to life, but I shall tell you how you might let her depart in peace. Yet my aid shall have its price - a lock of your hair.
Geralt|Hm. How can I know you won't use it to cast a spell on me?
Lynx Rock Witch|I require this, I must, for with it I will cast a spell to conceal me from you for all time, and will use it for nothing else. You will nag me never again. And you've nothing to fear, I assure you, I always keep my word.
Geralt|I'll trust you, against my better judgment. Lock of my hair's yours.
Lynx Rock Witch|Splendid.
Geralt|What do I need to do?
Lynx Rock Witch|You must convince the maiden her beloved yearned to return but perished in the attempt.
Lynx Rock Witch|Take her silk kerchief and a fragment of Gareth's remains. His bones lie bleaching in the cave beneath this rock.
Lynx Rock Witch|Fire must consume the kerchief and remains. And remember, your heart, your intentions must be pure. Clear?
Geralt|Yeah. Thanks for your help.
Lynx Rock Witch|You are welcome. And adieu - once you walk out that door, never shall we meet again.
Geralt|Got a bone of his already.
Lynx Rock Witch|Doubtless taken as a professional precaution. Good.
Geralt|Refuse to help me, and I'll make you regret it… and force you to.
Lynx Rock Witch|Do you know what really makes my blood boil? Bluster, threats, especially beneath my own roof.
Geralt|Wouldn't need to use either if you'd cooperate.
Lynx Rock Witch|How would I do that given you will soon be dead?
Lynx Rock Witch|Akhan daal!
Geralt|The lady's knight - he ever make it here?
Lynx Rock Witch|Sir Gareth? Yes. He came to sway me, but had a quick change of heart. To be precise, it came after the first night we spent together.
Lynx Rock Witch|He stayed a fair while. Then his conscience got the better of him, and he resolved to return to his beloved.
Geralt|Might've resolved to. But never made it.
Lynx Rock Witch|A tragic fate befell him along the way.
Geralt|You have anything to do with this turn of fate?
Lynx Rock Witch|Of course. Was I to let another woman have a man who belonged to me? Hmph.  I could not abide it.
Lynx Rock Witch|You have bested me. Tradition ordains I must grant you three wishes it seems.
Geralt|You know exactly why I'm here.
Lynx Rock Witch|Very well, I will help you. Albeit I pity the lass not at all, I shall do what I can to break the curse that imprisons her soul in the tree.
Geralt|Hold you to that. Daphne didn't deserve her fate.
Lynx Rock Witch|Tales can be cruel.
Lynx Rock Witch|Now begone, leave me be. I can tend to the rest alone.
Geralt|Remember the deal we made.
Lynx Rock Witch|I have given you my word, I will keep it. Adieu.
Geralt|Why should I trust you?
Lynx Rock Witch|A word once given I always keep.
Lynx Rock Witch|You win! I yield!
Geralt|Thought you'd save her, at least try.
Lynx Rock Witch|It cannot be done. I know my magic, its limits, and I know when I face a force more powerful than spells.
Lynx Rock Witch|Go see to your maiden.
Geralt|Hm…
Geralt|Not about to trust you. With a lock of my hair or anything else.
<|endoftext|>
Jacob Lumberjack|So? You met the witch, you must have. What did you learn?
Geralt|Daphne's kerchief - we'll use it to lift the curse.
Geralt|But we gotta start at the right time. When the hour comes, I'll light four fires for the four winds, then begin the ritual.
Jacob Lumberjack|Fires? Then I shall be of use to you, after all. Seems you need wood, much of it!
Geralt|Chop as much as you can. I'll see to the rest.
Geralt|I can lift the curse, free her. By performing a ritual, making a sacrifice of her kerchief and Gareth's remains.
Geralt|That witch? She's not near as bad as folk say.
Geralt|Made me bow and scrape, sure, but I know some sorceresses witchier than her.
Jacob Lumberjack|Joyous bleeding news, but what about Daphne?!
Jacob Lumberjack|I've chopped and stacked the wood. What now?
Geralt|My turn. Gotta light fires and talk to the woman enchanted in the tree.
Geralt|No idea how this'll turn out, so just in case, stand at a distance.
Geralt|And if you see me draw my sword, run.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Hear me, you who hide beneath this bark! Recall today who you really are!
Geralt|Behold a kerchief, proof of your love for another.
Geralt|Dammit… Run!
Geralt|Behold a bone of he to whom you offered your love.
Tree Ghost|Gareth, my Gareth. He shall never return.
Geralt|No. He won't.
Tree Ghost|Is his love for me gone? Did he stay true?
Geralt|Gareth remained faithful to the end of his days.
Tree Ghost|The time comes that I depart. I've waited too long, I've suffered too much, and now I wish to go.
Jacob Lumberjack|Farewell, m'Lady.
Tree Ghost|I thank you, stranger.
Tree Ghost|And you, my knight. I thank you for speaking to me, for standing vigil at my feet.
Jacob Lumberjack|I did not think it would end this way. I hoped we could revive her, but I guess it was not to be.
Geralt|We did all we could.
Jacob Lumberjack|You did well. Here, your pay. And the book is yours, as well.
Geralt|Thanks. Take care of yourself.
Jacob Lumberjack|So long, witcher. I must think, put this straight in my head.
Geralt|"Happily ever after" doesn't often happen in life. Sadly.
Geralt|Gareth broke his vow, failed to stay faithful.
Jacob Lumberjack|Man is built of mud and filth, m'Lady. And is like to blunder, we all are.
Tree Ghost|How cruel is the world to render conferring one's love so hard.
Jacob Lumberjack|But what would the world be without love?
Geralt|Hear me, you who hide beneath this bark! The day of your freedom has come!
Geralt|Behold a kerchief, proof of your love for another.
<|endoftext|>
Jacob Lumberjack|Fecking fairy-flaps, what the demon happened there?!
Geralt|My fault. Went about lifting the curse the wrong way. More like tore than freed her from her prison. Shock was too much. Released all the rage and pain that was in her.
Jacob Lumberjack|Blimey, man. I suppose that's what I get for hiring a bungler.
Jacob Lumberjack|At least the lady's pain is done, she'll suffer no more in the tree. Now take your coin and go.
Geralt|Dammit… Witch freed the ghost from the tree, as promised.
Geralt|Failed to add the specter'd be insane, full of pain and rage.
Geralt|Possessed the first living creature it ran into - the dog. Dog then killed Jacob.
Geralt|Farewell, chivalrous woodsman. Sorry it ended this way.
Geralt|Life's rarely like a fairytale. Still, folk've gotta have faith, believe in something.

Geralt|Hey, happen to know how the hell I can walk on that water?
Toussaint Old Man 05|Naturally, I know. Since time immemorial have I dwelt in solitude on this shore. And I can testify to the extraordinary nature of the lake.
Geralt|What's so extraordinary about it - I mean, besides the fact that you can walk on its surface?
Toussaint Old Man 05|A sword most wondrous lies in its depths. I watch over it.
Toussaint Old Man 05|The blade may be grasped solely by one who possesses the five chivalric virtues.
Geralt|Folk call me a lot of things, but virtuous - I dunno…
Toussaint Old Man 05|Yet I do know. For I know who you are…
Toussaint Old Man 05|To acquire the sword, you must first convince me you are worthy. The inscriptions on these stones describe the five virtues - valor, honor, wisdom, sympathy and generosity.
Toussaint Old Man 05|During your time in Toussaint, you can prove these virtues dwell in your heart. In this world there are many in need - they will help you prove your chivalry.
Toussaint Old Man 05|Reason guides your actions, as it does those of all who are wise.
Toussaint Old Man 05|You have proven the five chivalric virtues dwell in your heart.
Geralt|Mean the sword's mine? I can dive in and take it?
Toussaint Old Man 05|The sword deserves the hand of a master. You must prove your skills are worthy through combat atop the water's surface. Are you ready?
Geralt|Any time.
Toussaint Old Man 05|Then draw your blade.
Geralt|Gonna need some time.
Toussaint Old Man 05|Your valor is the stuff of legends.
Toussaint Old Man 05|Of humble means yourself, you show generosity to others.
Toussaint Old Man 05|You are a man of honor, as many can attest.
Toussaint Old Man 05|You have proven yourself capable of great sympathy.
Geralt|I'm walking on water. Just like…
Toussaint Old Man 05|Like who?
Geralt|Like a pond skater. Who were you thinking?
Toussaint Old Man 05|No matter. I suppose you thought nothing else in life could surprise you, ehh? Wrong!
Toussaint Old Man 05|Return once you've proven you possess the five virtues.
Geralt|Hey, hermit.
Toussaint Old Man 05|Greetings. Ready to stand and fight for the wondrous blade?
Toussaint Old Man 05|To know more about the five chivalric virtues, you must read the inscriptions carved into the stones.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Old Man 05|You have proven worthy of wielding the blade. Beyond all doubt.
Lady Of The Lake|Behold, your Aerondight…
Geralt|We've met before…
Lady Of The Lake|Certainly. The hermit admitted he knew you, remember?
Geralt|The Lady of the Lake…
Lady Of The Lake|It is I. Forget not that you are a man right and honorable, devoted to doing good. And for these reasons you received the blade. Now bear it.
Lady Of The Lake|And I trust this time you shall not lose it…
Toussaint Old Man 05|It seems failure is your lot in this quest, witcher!
Toussaint Old Man 05|To lay claim to virtue is easy, to prove it, much harder! But perhaps one day… who knows.
Geralt|Hmm… Hey! Anyone here?!
Geralt|Dammit. Looks like I'm too late for the "test."
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What's that about?
Geralt|Strange armor… wound's unusual, too. What's going on here?
Geralt|Trail leads towards the house on the hill.
Toussaint Trader 03|Which stands silent as a grave…
Geralt|Gate's locked from the inside. Clearly been jostled, though. Something tried to get out.
Toussaint Trader 03|Brrrr, the very thought sends a cold wind down my back.
Geralt|Silver tableware? Elven engravings…
Geralt|Multiple wounds on the body. All puncture wounds, but hard to tell what caused them. Victim's human… but the attire's elven.
Toussaint Trader 03|Are you certain? How did he come by it? We've so few nonhumans in Toussaint.
Geralt|Burn marks. Something catch fire? Explode? Strong stench…
Geralt|What the hells' this? Setting for a banquet?
Toussaint Trader 03|It seems so. What's your suspicion? Did none survive? Gods…
Geralt|Throat's massacred. One mighty blow. Shield alongside's old and dented. Sword's ceremonial. Aen Seidhe handiwork, clearly…
Geralt|Servant… Stabbed to death. Over a dozen blows with a sharp object, some postmortem.
Toussaint Trader 03|I cannot believe this the work of a man. It was a monster, to be sure!
Geralt|Torso punctured with great force. Blow pierced hardened steel. Man on the high road - breastplate was identical.
Geralt|Ceremonial bowls? For little sacrifices?
Toussaint Trader 03|Of what? Please do not say humans…
Geralt|Burned alive… Really high temperature at work here.
Toussaint Trader 03|Lebioda, thou art my defender and protector, thou bringest good news…
Geralt|Fled… Then dropped to the ground to douse the flames. Didn't manage.
Geralt|Burnt smell's growing fainter. Might've been another, luckier soul, managed to flee.
Geralt|Dammit…
Geralt|Doublet's scorched… Wriggled out of it, tossed it, then ran on.
Geralt|Hmm… Somehow doubt I'll ever know what happened here.
Geralt|Gate's locked from the inside but got jostled pretty hard. Barely hanging on the hinges.
Geralt|Must've been here he broke his legs. Fell while climbing over the wall. Trying to leave the property, probably, after he didn't manage to open the gate.
Toussaint Trader 03|Good gods!
Geralt|Someone tried to scale the wall but fell. Probably tried to flee the estate, but couldn't get the gate open. Not likely to have gotten far, lost too much blood…
Geralt|Trail's taking me down the path…
Geralt|Why're you here?
Toussaint Trader 03|I-I saw you walking toward the estate. To leave you to risk this alone, it would not be fair. I could be of use, perhaps…?
Geralt|Doubt it. But stay if you want. Just, not one peep, please. And don't touch anything.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Trader 03|The sculptures… they came alive? By what witchcraft?
Geralt|Dunno. Specialize in killing monsters. Reviving them - not so much.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|I… I may know what happened. The statues, you see, once stood in the palace of one Divethaf. I acquired them a month past because-- Err, perhaps I should start at the beginning.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|This Divethaf was to pay tribute to humans, producing statues of this sort each year. Yet… he did so but once, for he perished in the massacre of nonhumans at the foot of Mount Gorgon in the year seven hundred and eighty-two.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|It's fortunate he did, too, as Divethaf had planned Ludovic's downfall. For he sculpted not statues but golems that masqueraded as such, golems activated with words said in homage… golems that would have turned the king and his bodyguards into so much colorful confetti.
Toussaint Trader 03|Typical… Treachery embodied, elves. Ptooey.
Geralt|You're no better. Elves were just defending their territory. You humans took it, but you still weren't sated… Had to cut the elves down, every last one.
Toussaint Trader 03|"You" - what does that mean? You're a man as we are.
Geralt|Yeah. In a way. Just ashamed to have to admit it sometimes.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Your words - they're wrong, witcher. But I'll not let you leave empty-handed. Take this - your reward.
Geralt|Farewell.
Geralt|Beast's dead, Path awaits. High time I was on my way.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Hold, master! Please, take this.
Toussaint Trader 03|A safe journey to you, witcher.
Toussaint Trader 03|Perhaps there's no one inside after--
Geralt|I know you're in there. Breathing's loud and clear. Open up. We mean you no harm.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Th-they… re-remain there?
Geralt|Who are you, exactly?
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|D-durand Faucher-Plamondon de S-savarin. Lord of these lands… and chairman of the Society of Friends of the History of Toussaint.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|We meet here annually, to mark the anniversary of the Elven Homage. But something like this… why, it's a first.
Geralt|Hm. So… while reenacting a scene from the past, somehow, unintentionally, you summoned a specter. A corgowrath or a tsoob, maybe…
Toussaint Trader 03|What… what now?
Geralt|Best thing? You gotta do it again, of course.
Toussaint Trader 03|Are you mad? Would you have this thing… kill us?
Geralt|No. Don't want it to kill anyone. Precisely why I gotta do my job - summon it again, whatever it is, and tend to it once and for all. Durand, think I can reenact the pledge, the giving of homage, alone?
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|It w-was a great, momentous event - the surrender of Toussaint's last elven king. You will need at least three individuals.
Geralt|You know what I'm gonna ask for. Need your help. But I'll understand if you turn me down.
Geralt|No objections? Good.
Geralt|Let's get to work. Start by clearing the corpses. Got some time… won't start the reenactment before nightfall. Things of this sort're a lot more likely to work after dusk.
Geralt|One last thing, though - my pay. Don't work for free, you know.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Understood. J-just keep the danger at b-bay, and I shall be generous, th-through and through.
Geralt|Dammit. Can't risk, can't expose you to danger…
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|M-master. If what you say is true, th-then I was the cause of this massacre. Unintentionally… yet nonetheless. I've a duty to assist you, a moral one.
Toussaint Trader 03|Gods have us in their care… I shall help as well.
Geralt|You mentioned "them." Who'd you mean?
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Those… I-I don't know what they were. Sp-spirits? It all occurred of a sudden…
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|We were staging a s-scene - D-Divethaf paying homage. Th-there was a flash of light that blinded me completely. I heard cries, though saw nothing… Then felt my own robes were in flames.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|I broke and ran, threw off my doublet, leapt in here and… shut and locked the door behind me.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|They pounded on the door. I-I thought they would get through, I thought I was done for. But… but in the end, it grew calm.
Geralt|Listen. I'm a witcher. I'm here to help you. But if that's gonna happen, you gotta answer some questions first.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Don't interrupt.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|I-I will stand, or rather s-sit, in for K-king Ludovic… upon the elven throne. While you, witcher, will play the Aen Seidhe ruler. W-we must don the costumes, all must be just right.
Toussaint Trader 03|"Divethaf, the elven king, hosted Ludovic in his own palace, upon his own throne… amidst the blinding glow of a plethora of torches."
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|You would do best to leave, resume your Path, master.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Trader 03|The dressings, bandages… where did I put them?
Geralt|Forget it. Bandages won't do him any good.
Toussaint Trader 03|What? But… he breathed still a moment ago.
Geralt|Mhm. Breathed his last, then. Bled to death. Leg's broken, femoral artery's ruptured. Wound like that, you're dead in minutes.
Toussaint Trader 03|Gods…
Geralt|What happened here, exactly?
Toussaint Trader 03|I… I was rolling through, fully loaded, when I heard screams. This one crawled towards the road, then drooped to the ground, lost consciousness. I jumped down to help him, dress his wounds. Then you appeared.
Geralt|Pretty admirable, stopping to help a stranger.
Toussaint Trader 03|Truthfully? When I saw him, I considered it might be an ambush - the thought entered my mind. I near decided to crack the whip… But to abandon a man in need? It's simply not the decent thing to do.
Geralt|Decent enough in many other places. Believe me.
Geralt|Before you go on, clean your hands thoroughly, and burn your shirt. Might also wanna rub some thyme on your body, to be sure. Smell of blood might attract ghouls otherwise.
Toussaint Trader 03|Who… who might you be, precisely?
Geralt|A witcher.
Toussaint Trader 03|Ah, gulp, uh-huh. Do you expect some… some beast might have killed him?
Geralt|See what we have here… Leg's broken, but cause of death's the wound. Small but deep, edges unfrayed.
Geralt|Either a thrust weapon or a thick claw, maybe a wyvern's. Tough to say, and…
Geralt|Hm. Breastplate's unusual. Dented… and it's got a patina.
Toussaint Trader 03|An antiquity, I believe… I deal in these things, so… What's puzzling is… why did he don it?
Geralt|Not likely to learn that from him.
Geralt|Now to figure out where he came from. From that house, I'm assuming, but need to investigate. Got some work to do, so… so long.
Toussaint Trader 03|Wait! I will come with you!
Geralt|Hm. So be it. But stay close, keep it down, and don't touch a thing.
Geralt|Gotta be kidding. This isn't a garden romp. Whatever killed him's damn dangerous and--
Toussaint Trader 03|And it might still prowl the area. So, if it's all the same, I'd prefer to accompany you!
Geralt|Might even know where he came from… Got work to do, so… so long.
Geralt|Could be… Not really my concern, though. Never work for free.
Toussaint Trader 03|I see… Farewell to you, then.
Geralt|Stand and step away from him.
Toussaint Trader 03|What? Me? But… what is your grief?
Geralt|Don't make me say it again. That's good advice.
Toussaint Trader 03|Will you tell me what it is you seek?
Geralt|Needed to see if you were lying.
Geralt|You'd be covered in blood if you'd dealt those wounds. Just got it on your hands, though. So all's in order.
Toussaint Trader 03|He tried to crawl away, though he was heavily wounded. Something horrifying must have been after him.
Toussaint Trader 03|Something dark happened here. Very dark.
Toussaint Trader 03|Hey! Heeey!! Do not dare leave me here alone!
Toussaint Trader 03|So… what will it be? Aim to see what's occurred after all?
Toussaint Trader 03|Here our paths diverge.
Toussaint Trader 03|Ooph… I'd begun to think you'd not return. It seems to me the man on the highroad, he crawled there from here.
Toussaint Trader 03|This man is dying…! Help me!
Geralt|What's going on?!
Toussaint Trader 03|The dressings, bandages…
<|endoftext|>
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Snow White!
Geralt|Name's Geralt. What can I do for you?
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|That hair! The scar! The frown! It's all… perfect!
Geralt|Something you actually want from me? Or are you just gonna go on gushing about my… attributes?
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|I admire, good sir! Admire and desire! Such a threat in the eyes! So manly!
Geralt|If you're trying to get me to meet with you some evening, afraid you're just wasting your time.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|An evening? Impossible. I shall require the soft light of mid-afternoon for this portrait.
Geralt|Portrait?
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Indeed! Yours! En face, actual size! With the finest vista Toussaint affords behind you!
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Pose for me! You must! Naturally, I shall pay the compensation due to you for your modeling services.
Geralt|Don't see why not. Long as it doesn't take long.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|It shan't, never worry! We've but a short distance to journey, into the hills outside of town.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|A perfect landscape perfectly to frame your perfect physiognomy.
Geralt|Let's go, then.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|I need only fetch my easel and palettes from my studio.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|We shall meet at noon at the western gate, near the palace. From where we'll venture forth together.
Geralt|No chance. Find yourself another model.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|A shame. More! An irreparable loss! Should you change your mind, I shall be here.
Geralt|Hey. Find anyone to sit for you? Plenty of imposing knights errant around, got manly looking scars on 'em, too.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|But none has hair as exquisite as yours! Reconsider, will you not? Your portrait - why, a true work of art it would be!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|I'm here.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Let us go! We should arrive in time to have the best light of the day. The chiaroscuro we shall capture - just glorious!
Geralt|Let's go. The things I do for art…
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|We had best ride there. We'll arrive faster and less fatigued.
Geralt|Ready to go, now.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Wonderful! You had me worried, yes. I was concerned you had changed your mind.
Geralt|I commit to something, I follow through. Usually.
Geralt|Not so fast. Need to tend to something first.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Humph. So be it. I shall await you here.
<|endoftext|>
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|A work of mine, "Turtle Dove O'er the Heath," hangs in the ducal palace.
Geralt|So does a cockatrice I cut down once. It's stuffed - maybe even with heather.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|I once had a cockatrice feather brush.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Best thing for laying down tempera.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|I no longer have it, sadly. My blasted cat swiped it!
Geralt|Why would a cat want a brush?
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|To paint with, of course. And it was no common brush. Fantastic, as I said. And fantastically expensive.
Geralt|Hang on. Got a cat that paints?
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Ugh! If you care to call it that! He merely copies the works of his betters. And poorly, at that.
Geralt|Your cat?
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Yes. Pierre-Auguste Moustacherois. It's no surprise you've not heard of him. He's a second-rate hack. And a thief.
<|endoftext|>
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Ladies, gentlemen, my lieges… Forgive me for being forward… but have you perchance seen a set of paints and brushes nearby?
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Eugenie… I believe this peasant wants something from us.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|My paints, my brushes… I had prepared them, they-they were here.
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|We've not seen any journeyman's tools, my good man. Of that I assure you.
Geralt|There a problem?
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Yes! An immense one! I cannot possibly paint without my… paints! I'm done for! Unless… you would be kind enough to locate them?
Geralt|Agh, dammit. Sure you left them here?
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Yes, right there! I'd prepared everything. Set it out, ordered and organized.
Geralt|Hmm, might've toppled downhill or something. Fine, I'll take a look around.
Geralt|Wouldn't happen to have another set with you?
Geralt|And, uh, nothing you could use instead?
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|My word! Would you really have me scrawl with charcoal like an animal?
Geralt|Ugh. Really don't feel like it. You asked me to pose, not… investigate. Sorry, but I refuse to go looking for your paints.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Do you mean that? Witcher, don't do this to me. I don't deserve this, it's-- it's not my fault. They were here, I swear, they--
Geralt|Next time, make sure you're prepared before you bother a witcher about something like this.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|This the place?
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Yes! Just look at the view - breathtaking! The perfect background for our masterpiece.
Geralt|Mhm. Pretty, I guess.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Now, you must carefully consider in what pose you wish to be immortalized.
Geralt|All right. Considering.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|All is ready, we may begin. Have you decided on the pose you'd like to adopt?
Geralt|How about I be on horseback. I mean, Roach kind of deserves to be immortalized, too.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Oh, yes! A horse! Exceptional idea! But I would rather you perch atop Alexander , my mount. I've trained him to pose.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|I shall paint in the carcass of a slain griffin later. Now, raise your head to exude pride, thrust your breast forward. Go on - breast forward!
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|I want to see those hocks extended! Ahem, is the horse paying attention?!
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|May I begin? Or would you rather try a different pose?
Geralt|Go ahead.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Now, if you wouldn't mind, that look you gave me when I first asked you to pose - would be so kind as to adopt it again?
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|That intense scowl of an angry wild ram about to butt heads.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Yes! Excellent! Now, hold that! Do not budge!
Geralt|This gonna take much longer?
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Not much, not much at all… We'll run out of daylight soon. Please, keep your head still, in the same position.
Geralt|Fine, I'll try. I'll also try to remember to never trust a painter again.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Griffin!
Geralt|Yeah, I know. You'll paint one in later.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Gods! A griiiiffiiiiin!!!!
Geralt|Run! And hide!
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Dearest mummy! Aaaa!
Geralt|Lemme try something else.
Geralt|Maybe I could just stand? Sword in hand?
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Ah! Splendid! A heroic pose - of course!
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|The bold warrior, his sword held aloft.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Ready to run at the… well, that willow over there. I will paint in a griffin later.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Shall I begin? Or would you prefer to adopt another pose?
Geralt|Ahg, go ahead.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Now, be so kind as to adopt that look you gave me when I first asked you to work with me…
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|That… intense scowl of an angry wild ram about to butt heads.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Yes! Excellent! Now, hold that! Do not budge!
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Dearest mummy! Aaaa!
Geralt|Lemme try something else.
Geralt|Think I'll lie down. Least that way I can nap while you work.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|The hero at rest, lying on his side, propped up on an elbow…
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Staring into the distance, relishing a victory… I can paint in a griffin corpse later.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Though naturally, a nap is out of the question. We resolved that earlier.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|May I begin? Or would you prefer to strike a more dynamic pose?
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Dearest mummy! Aaaa!
<|endoftext|>
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Is it safe?
Geralt|Yeah. Come on out. And no wonder no one ever came here - it was a griffin's hunting ground.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|That thing scared me to death.
Geralt|Not quite to death. You are alive. Not least because you chose a witcher to sit for you. How's the painting? It survive, too?
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|It did. But I cannot show it to you now. I never display unfinished work.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|You can see it tomorrow, after midday, where we met. I shall display it in the market square.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Ffhh, monstrous beast. Shall we immortalize it in the painting?
Geralt|Yeah, let's add it. Carcass can serve as your prop.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Splendid! Hmm… Interesting color palette… And the textures! And the proportions! It will do, yes, it will do.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|But I shall paint it in later in my atelier. There's an excellent illustration in the Encyclopaedia Maxima Mundi. I fear this specimen is, well… too far cut and chopped.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Ah, very well. That will do for now. I shall polish the details later. No point struggling on in this fading light.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Ah. I almost forgot. Payment for your troubles.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|And I thank you for saving my life. Though in doing so, you did also save your likeness… for posterity!
Geralt|No. It's too mangled, too gruesome this way .
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Hmm… Indeed. The hue of its blood would not go well with your complexion.
<|endoftext|>
Beauclair Citizen Woman 02|Look at the posture! So proud and upstanding! And not a scrap of fat. Though the veins are a bit much.
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|I cannot disagree. Quite well-built. Fine fetlocks, too. A noble horse.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 02|You and horses! I speak of the witcher! Oh, to wrap my arms around a man like that and… oooh!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 02|A mighty beast!
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|Meh. A war horse like any other.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 02|What do you mean, horse? I speak of the griffin!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 02|Those muscles - oh, my!
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|Incredible, aren't they? Quite the beast, that griffin.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 02|Griffin? I speak of the witcher! A well-built fellow - all over!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 02|Ahh, to lie alongside that for a good long snuggle!
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|Are you mad? And risk getting blood on you, or worse?! You should be careful with griffins, even dead ones!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 02|Who said anything about a griffin? I meant the witcher!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 02|A hero! The mane, the muscles!
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|I find it's all a bit… much. And the background? Pure fantasy! Toussaint looks nothing like that!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 02|Forget about the background… You'd do better to study his musculature!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 02|Oh me, oh my! Now that's my kind of art!
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|Moustacherois would have produced something better. And chosen a better vista as a background.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 02|Background!? Who cares?! Look at that exquisite body!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Greetings.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Geralt! There you are! So, our painting - are you pleased, is it to your liking? Do tell.
Geralt|Not exactly what I imagined. I believe I posed with all my clothes on. Clearly remember that, in fact. Some other details are off, too.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Invalid as a criticism! I depicted you in a more flattering state! The painting has drawn crowds, aroused a great deal of interest.
Geralt|Can see that. Anyway, some advice for the future - warn your subjects about your intentions. Your next model might not be so forgiving.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|You don't like it. I'm hurt.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Perhaps you'd care to buy the painting?
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Given our rapport, I shall take a loss. For you, I'll part with it, I will - at a special price.
Geralt|Why not. It'll make an interesting memento. Though I'd hardly call the price a bargain.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Heh. Indeed few have the sophistication to appreciate my technique. I sometimes go hungry as a consequence.
Geralt|Hm. All right. Least this way I'll be able to control who sees it. Thanks.
Geralt|Huh, as special as it is, that's still quite a price. Afraid I don't have that much coin.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Not a problem. Come back when you do. Though I cannot guarantee someone won't have beaten you to it.
Geralt|Doubt I'd have any use for it.
Geralt|I'm sure you'll find an eager… art lover to buy it.
Geralt|Don't know much about modern art, but… seems nowadays being true to life counts for less than other, umm… qualities.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Do you refer to the fact I painted you au naturel? All the greats do that these days!
Geralt|My point, exactly. Changed quite a few things, some of the details. Moustacherois embellish this much, too?
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|To look at his "paintings," one can hardly tell if the subject is depicted en face or in profile, why, even in color or in monochrome. He's an amateur.
Geralt|Guess I oughta be glad he wasn't the one to paint me, then.
Geralt|It's… nice. Shows a lot of, uhh, imagination. Don't recall undressing before posing, though. Some of the other details're a bit off, too.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Well, the imagination is an artist's chief tool!
Geralt|Heard the same from a certain poet. He embellishes and invents - chiefly.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Witcher! Greetings. I've been on pins and needles.  I take it you've come for the painting!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Rest of the eggs haven't hatched yet. Need to burn the whole nest.
Geralt|That oughta do it.
Geralt|Already started in on it. Hope they didn't muck up the tracks.
Geralt|What the hell happened here…?
Geralt|Right. High time I collected a trophy.
Geralt|Traces of draconid blood, barely perceptible. I'm on the right track.
Geralt|Good thing I incinerated those eggs back there. Now to collect my reward…
Geralt|Blood… Draconid must've hit it pretty hard. Dropped the cow, then probably tried to steady its flight. Got hurt in the process.
Geralt|Good. Should be simple to track down.
Geralt|Landed on the roof of the distillery. Raised a ruckus, made a mess, then moved on…
Geralt|Started bleeding, heavily. Wound was more serious than I thought, looks like.
Geralt|Paw prints. Crawled through here. Clearly too tired to fly.
Geralt|Dammit… Half-eaten body with… scorch marks? Hmm, definitely not a wyvern.
Geralt|Slyzard - gotta be. They breathe fire.
Geralt|Mhh, had it right. Slyzards stole the cows. Well, killed them already. Maybe now I can get someone to pay me for it.
Geralt|*Sniff sniff* Hmm. Smells like… sour mash. Draconid must've attacked a local distillery. Bastard.
Geralt|Aha. So it's a slyzard…
<|endoftext|>
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|What the golly blasting devils are you doing, men?! What plague?! An unfortunate turns of events, that's all. Get back to chiseling! If we don't deliver that head on time, the investor will twist my plums off!
Toussaint Peasant Man 01|Is that what you'll tell Emil's widow? That a cow crushed him, and it was an accident? This, sir, is a grave matter. It requires a specialist - some mage or warlock.
Geralt|What happened here?
Toussaint Peasant Man 02|Look, it's that witcher who's come to town. Maybe he can do something? An exorcism or the like? We should ask how much coin he'll want.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Did you see our notice? Is that why you've come?
Geralt|Didn't see any notice, no. But since I'm here, be glad to hear you out, know the problem. This some kind of plague you fear?
Toussaint Peasant Man 02|Yes, indeed! And a horrid one at that! We've irked the gods something true, we have. In Zerrikania, they sent a plague of locusts, then of frogs. With us, they skipped right to raining cows down on us.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Enough! Enough! No need to sow panic. Come, master witcher, I shall divulge to you the matter at hand.
Geralt|Saw your notice. Got a problem with… a cow? Fear a plague, is that it?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Must be Emil, workers mentioned him. Poor guy, unlucky as all hell…
Geralt|Right, now where do I start…?
Geralt|Got it. All clear, now. Cow died when it fell from a great height. Draconid must've dropped it. A youngster, probably, trying to get the cow back to its nest, but it proved too heavy. Emil's bad luck to be standing right underneath.
Geralt|And then there's the crane.
Geralt|Crushed by something heavy… Skull base is cracked.
Geralt|Fresh tooth marks - necrophages, but they got to him after his death.
Geralt|Won't learn anything else from the body.
Geralt|Tissue's crushed in places. Must've fallen from quite a height.
Geralt|Gut's sliced open, hmm. Not much blood, so it happened after death. Heart had already stopped pumping.
Geralt|Tooth marks… small ones, though… so necrophages left 'em, clearly. Sure sniffed out their feast fast.
Geralt|Deep claw wounds. Spread between talons indicates a draconid, a wyvern, probably. But these wounds weren't the cause of death.
Geralt|Right.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Peasant Man 01|Bumbotch this job. I'd never have signed on if I'd known it'd be like this.
Toussaint Peasant Man 02|Crushed by a cow? Shameful. Not fit to be used on the gravestone…
Toussaint Peasant Man 03|If that's the way it is, I'm off. I won't do it. No botchy way.
Toussaint Peasant Man 04|If this keeps up, next the rivers will flow with blood!
Toussaint Peasant Man 05|We should drop our tools, occupy the building, say fiddlesticks to it all.
Toussaint Peasant Man 01|To trust a freak at his word? And if another cow kerduddles one of us?
Toussaint Peasant Man 02|A slyzard, sure… two slyzards, blast, why not make it ten?!
Toussaint Peasant Man 03|What if instead… the rivers were to flow with ale?
Toussaint Peasant Man 04|Never. No, never would I have agreed to this work had I known it would be like this.
Toussaint Peasant Man 05|Nothing but work, work, work. And for what? For fum-diddly-nothing, that's what!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Ah, so it was mommy who helped you…
Geralt|Whoa, slyzard's son seems to be joining the fray.
Geralt|Was in a bad way, barely crawling.
Geralt|Hm, second draconid landed here. A larger one. Waited for the smaller one to heal, then they flew off together.
Geralt|Should be easy to track - smaller one was still bleeding, luckily.
Geralt|Flew off together. Probably bound for their nest.
Geralt|Hm, another cow… This one's been dead a lot longer, though. Slyzard did this, too. Can tell by the claw marks, the burns.
Geralt|Must feel safe here.
Geralt|Huh, another cow. Been here longer, this one. Lots. What do we got here - burn marks? Hmm… No wyvern made these.
Geralt|Slyzards, gotta be. Only they breathe fire. Clearly feel safe here. Mh.
<|endoftext|>
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|All cleared up now, right? No gods, no plague, just a dragon. But it's gone, too! We're to pay Emil's widow compensation and that will be that. So, why do you still stand there and wait, men? Back to work. Chop! Chop!
Toussaint Peasant Man 02|And I've a notion suspicious workings are still afoot. What became of the builders who were to put the statue together? They were due three days back, yet there's still no sign of them at Ardaiso.
Toussaint Peasant Man 01|They were crushed, too, I'm certain of it. Or eaten. Or! Or locusts got them! Like in Zerrikania!
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|What's this rubbish you spout now? The architect wrote they would arrive a week late with a large shipment of marble from Metinna. For the prophet's beard. So stop flapping your yaps and get to work.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Allow me to walk you away, master.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Truth be told, I lied. But I cannot have them panic again. The workers he mentioned, they've indeed vanished. Come see me later, I shall divulge to you the details.
Toussaint Peasant Man 01|You think he'll manage?
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Rumor has it he slew a basilisk once.
Toussaint Peasant Man 02|Right. With a mirror, no less.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Master witcher! What luck to happen upon you!
Geralt|Got work for me? A new contract?
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Of the contract in question you acquitted yourself beautifully years past, on your last sojourn in Beauclair.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|I was in a bit of a bind at the time… Do you remember? Yet I swore a solemn vow to pay you in full one day.
Geralt|Guess it rings a bell…
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Sadly, you went on your way before I could settle matters with you. So I took your coin and placed it in an account for safekeeping.
Geralt|Hm. What kind of account?
Toussaint Noble Man 02|A savings account. At Cianfanelli Bank. You need but walk in and withdraw. The sum must be rather substantial by now…
Geralt|Thanks. Head over there first chance I get.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Ah, the serendipity! I'm so glad you're back!
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Good to see you again.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|I'd like to reactivate my account so I need a copy of Permit A38.
Beauclair Banker Woman 01|Wrong window, I fear.
Geralt|Whaddaya mean, "wrong window"?! I was told I'd get Permit A38 here.
Beauclair Banker Woman 01|Please remain calm, sir, or you'll rupture a vein.
Geralt|So just tell me where I get this stupid document.
Beauclair Banker Woman 01|Perhaps upstairs? In records? Or downstairs in the archive? You must ask them, sir.
Geralt|Do just that.
Geralt|Happen to know where I can do it, then?
Beauclair Banker Woman 01|Hmm. Let me think…
Geralt|Need Form 202 to get a copy of Permit A38. D'you know that? Couldn't have told me? Wasted a lot of time because of you.
Beauclair Banker Woman 01|Please, sir. There's no need to lose your temper. I thought it obvious and thus needed no stating. The form will soon be ready. Name and surname?
Geralt|Geralt of Rivia.
Beauclair Banker Woman 01|Let me find it… Gedon… Gemmel… Here it is – Geralt of Rivia.
Beauclair Banker Woman 01|Sorry, sir, I cannot issue Form 202.
Geralt|Excuse me?
Beauclair Banker Woman 01|The applicant in question has been declared dead. Officially. Now, do tell me, sir - how am I to enter that into the ledger?
Geralt|Got you some flowers. Just a thank you… for helping me with my file.
Beauclair Banker Woman 01|Oh, but I… I shouldn't… For me, really?
Geralt|Match the color of your eyes.
Beauclair Banker Woman 01|Oh my… you, sir, are quite the charmer…
Beauclair Banker Woman 01|Ah, please wait a moment. I shall fetch Master Cianfanelli. Perhaps he'll arrange something that excludes the paperwork.
Geralt|Like musky aromas, right?
Beauclair Banker Woman 01|And how would you know that, sir?
Geralt|Smelled it *Sniff*… when you walked by. That scent you wear… lovely.
Geralt|So I thought to myself… bet she'll like this, too.
Beauclair Banker Woman 01|Oh, but I… I shouldn't, really…
Geralt|Please accept it. As a token of my thanks for your help with my file.
Geralt|Gotta admit something before I go, though. Had an ulterior motive for coming here.
Beauclair Banker Woman 01|What… motive?
Geralt|To enjoy a bit of conversation with you. It's probably why I'll come back, then come back again…
Geralt|Until the day you give me a smile. That moment, that's what I'm waiting for.
Geralt|Come back later.
Beauclair Banker Woman 01|As you wish, sir.
Geralt|I need Form 202.
Beauclair Banker Woman 01|I believe I was clear, sir. There's nothing I can do.
Geralt|This A38 permit… In a bit of a hurry, see? There any way we could speed this up?
Beauclair Banker Woman 01|Does the gentleman believe the rules do not apply to him and he may resolve things "under the table"…? Well, if so, he's mistaken.
Beauclair Banker Woman 01|Welcome to Cianfanelli Bank, where we look after your coin as if it were our own, et cetera, et cetera… How can I help you, sir?
<|endoftext|>
Beauclair Banker Man 01|Welcome to Cianfanelli Bank, where we look after your coin as if it were our own, and the customer is always right. How might I help you?
Geralt|This where I get Permit A38?
Beauclair Banker Man 01|Naturally. Just hand me your Form 202, please.
Geralt|Form 202? Just what're you trying to pull?
Beauclair Banker Man 01|Sir, I'm not pulling anything. Just following procedure.
Beauclair Banker Man 01|Permit A38 can only be issued upon presentation of Form 202, as stated specifically in Ordinance N60.
Beauclair Banker Man 01|Please go to window number one.
Geralt|Argh. Just came from there. Never mind. Be back shortly with Form 202.
Geralt|Form 202. All right. Where do I get that document?
Beauclair Banker Man 01|Allow me to explain.
Geralt|Permit A38 - I'd like to get a copy, please.
Beauclair Banker Man 01|And I'd like to see Form 202. Please.
Geralt|Form 202 - sure I don't get that here?
Beauclair Banker Man 01|Sir, that is a pre-numbered document. Do you have any idea of the restrictions and safeguards involved? I'm afraid I can't issue it.
Geralt|I'll be back.
Beauclair Banker Man 01|And I shall be here.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|I need Permit A38. Any chance you could issue me a copy?
Beauclair Banker Man 02|Fiddlesticks, I've just run out.
Geralt|Wait… really?
Beauclair Banker Man 02|Of course not! In truth, I've never had anything of the sort! This is the archive!
Geralt|Form 202… I could use a copy.
Beauclair Banker Man 02|Why come to me for a form at all? I have none. This is the archive. I've nothing you need and cannot help you.
Geralt|Listen, say I made a small donation? To a certain member of the bank's staff?
Beauclair Banker Man 02|A bribe, sir? How dare you?! I truly cannot help! This is the archive.
Geralt|That'll be all, thanks.
Beauclair Banker Man 02|Yes, yes, it's what they always say…
Beauclair Banker Man 02|And once you're upstairs, do tell them not to send every lost fool with a problem to me! I've work to do!
Beauclair Banker Man 02|What is it? Folk are hard at work here.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Sorry, gotta get through.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Hold, there! What is this?! Back of the queue, sir!
Toussaint Noble Man 03|You cut in front of me, sir…
Geralt|Did no such thing. Been standing here the whole time.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Is that so? You know you're the third today to try that ruse?!
Toussaint Noble Man 03|I will not stand for this! Just you wait, I'll teach you some manners…
Geralt|Go on. Hit me.
Beauclair Bank Guard 01|Ho, gentlemen! If you wish to raise a ruckus, do it outside!
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Outside! Now!
Geralt|Mh. Well, couldn't really give a crap.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|You boor, you churl!
Geralt|Argh, closed…
Toussaint Noble Man 03|They've got their break, now. Wait with the rest of us.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|That'll do, sir! Jumping the queue?! How dare you?!
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Uncouth petty bourgeois… Cuts in line, then resorts to fisticuffs…
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Next time, mind your place, you churl!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Come on… where the hell'd she go?
Geralt|*Sniff* Hair pomade… need to follow the scent, could be the lead I need.
Geralt|Got no choice, I guess. Need to wait till they're done with their break.
Geralt|Locked. Key should be with one of the guards.
Geralt|All right… Where's window number one?
Geralt|Mhm. Gotta keep looking.
Geralt|Damn bureaucracy.
Geralt|When I get my hands on that twit…
Geralt|Hm, a key.
Geralt|Need to come back during the day.
<|endoftext|>
Bank Veteran|You must wait. They have their break now.
Bank Veteran|So, what do you hope to get here, my friend?
Geralt|Permit A38. Though, guess I need Form 202 as well, now.
Bank Veteran|Form 202? Easy peasy! Certificate P - now that is a challenge…
Bank Veteran|But as we are both forced to wait… fancy a round of gwent?
Geralt|Why not. Let's lay' em out.
Bank Veteran|Now that I understand! I'll start arranging my deck.
Geralt|See you know this place pretty well. Must've taken care of a good amount of business…
Bank Veteran|Naturally, my friend, naturally… indeed, I've managed to work the system a time or two.
Bank Veteran|You see, such things require finesse, subtlety. Otherwise, you're stuck!
Bank Veteran|I have seen them try everything. Magic, hypnosis, bribery… nothing works.
Geralt|Might as well go if nothing works. There's nothing I can do?
Bank Veteran|Be kind, be pleasant. This and only this. The woman, here, she sits at her window twelve hours each day without hearing so much as a "good day" from anyone.
Bank Veteran|But muster up some flowers, some perfume, well, you will resolve your matter lickety-split.
Geralt|Right, certainly worth a shot.
Bank Veteran|Good luck!
Bank Veteran|A seasoned player, I see. Congratulations.
Bank Veteran|As your prize, I shall reveal to you my foolproof method for cutting through this bureaucracy. Nothing ever comes of using the normal channels.
Geralt|Wow… Didn't stand a chance there.
Bank Veteran|Years of practice, my friend. I've stood in these queues so long, I could not help but learn a great many tricks…
Bank Veteran|Speaking of which, I've a tip for you, a means to resolve your matter…
Bank Veteran|She's not there. You must wait.
Geralt|Pardon me?
Bank Veteran|Miss Constance, window one. She went on her break and has yet to return. So we wait.
Geralt|Don't have much of a choice, I guess…
Bank Veteran|Perhaps you would fancy a round of gwent? To kill the time…?
<|endoftext|>
Beauclair Banker Woman 02|So she arrived in this little Nazairi cloak. And I tell you, love – tasteless is an understatement.
Beauclair Banker Woman 03|Nazairi…? I'd never wear anything from that barbaric land.
Beauclair Banker Woman 02|You know her. She often goes deep in hock to put on a show. That little number likely cost more than we make in a month.
Beauclair Banker Woman 03|I truly wonder who she got to lend her that much coin…
Beauclair Banker Woman 02|So you see, she claims puffed sleeves will be in fashion next season…
Geralt|Excuse me, got something I gotta take care of at window one…
Beauclair Banker Woman 03|Puffed? You cannot be serious.
Beauclair Banker Woman 02|I, too, find it hard to believe, for--
Geralt|Excuse me!
Beauclair Banker Woman 02|Can you not see what it says there?
Beauclair Banker Woman 02|We're on our break…
Beauclair Banker Woman 01|Celine, darling, sign this for me, will you?
Geralt|Oh, there you are. Listen, there's something I--
Beauclair Banker Woman 02|We are on break!
Beauclair Banker Woman 01|Ah, you try to be polite, it just never gets through…
Beauclair Banker Woman 03|I was at home the other day, just sitting, when suddenly – knock, knock! I opened the door and who was there if not Lebioda's witnesses…
Beauclair Banker Woman 02|I've heard of them. What did they want?
Beauclair Banker Woman 03|Oh, they left me a stack of manuscripts about the Prophet. I've not had time yet to look through them.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Cianfanelli, no more excuses. Pay out my coin. Now.
Cianfanelli|C'mon, master witcher, fir wye the ire?! There's nae need! We'll have it all for ye, just need tae see the necessary documents.
Geralt|Got a document right here means a hell of a lot more than any of your forms or permits. Have a look.
Cianfanelli|H… Her Enlightened Highness… she's hired ye?
Geralt|Mhm. And as her personal emissary, I demand access to my account. Right now.
Cianfanelli|A… Aye, master witcher. This way.
Geralt|Got a problem with my account. Wanted to withdraw some coin, see, but…
Cianfanelli|Nae problem there, we'll get ye paid up in a jiffy! Just gonnae need tae settle yon tiny wee trifle…
Geralt|Heard that already. Permit A38, among others…
Cianfanelli|Mah hands're tied without them, Geralt. But I see ye're a quick learner in the ways o' banking. Ye'll get them in a heartbeat.
Geralt|Look in on you later.
Cianfanelli|We're here to serve! And if ye've a matter for a high heid yin, make a beeline to yers truly!
Cianfanelli|Ye tell 'em – dinnae disturb, but no… Always some bugger wha cannae stand tae wait.
Cianfanelli|Plough me, who's this?! Hearty greetin's, master Geralt. Ye havenae paid us a visit in eons.
Geralt|Been a bit busy. But I'm back now, and I need your help with something.
Cianfanelli|Course. Now do tell, how can I help ye?
Cianfanelli|Master Geralt, how can I be o' service?
<|endoftext|>
Cianfanelli|Done. Deposit box 256 - last yin on the right.
Geralt|Got a week. Not one day more.
Cianfanelli|Ye shan't regret this, I swear. I'll rustle it up, have it ready for ye in seven days.
Geralt|Mhm. See you then.
Geralt|Fooled me once. Not about to let you fool me again.
Cianfanelli|Master Geralt, I beg ye, keep yer heid! We can work this out, I know we can.
Geralt|Rip that coin out of your throat if I have to.
Cianfanelli|Guards! Heeeeelp!
Geralt|What the hell's this, Cianfanelli? Box is empty.
Cianfanelli|Well…. errr… coin's got tae circulate, so when we learned ye were dead, master, we, uhh, circulated yers…
Cianfanelli|Purchased stocks, bonds, invested in a few vineyards… Before we knew it, there was hee haw left in the box.
Geralt|Really oughta call it what it is. You robbed me, plain and simple.
Cianfanelli|Nae, master witcher, never! I wouldnae dare…
Geralt|Oh, you'd dare. And now you'll answer for it. Open the gate.
Cianfanelli|Master witcher! I'll pay it all back, every red copper! Swear it on mah nana's beard!
<|endoftext|>
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Please disperse! The exhibition is closed!
Geralt|What's this about?
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Oh Lebioda, give me strength! I can't bear this! I believe I've been clear - no presentation today!
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Wait… are you not that famous witcher, Geralt of Rivia?! I believe I have work for you!
Geralt|What kind of work?
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Work related to the monument to Reginald d'Aubry…
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|The matter is a delicate one, but mind you, I pay well… Alas, I can say no more at this stage. Interested?
Geralt|The statue - just tell me what's the problem.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|A picture's worth a thousand words! More, I daresay! Come with me. I'll show you.
Geralt|Don't have time for this just now.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|I understand perfectly. Time is coin, after all. But… find some time for me and I shall find some coin for you! Think it over.
Geralt|Saw your notice. Mentioned a monument?
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Witcher! Decided yet? Will you see to our monument's, uh, little problem?
<|endoftext|>
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Here it is. Our pride and joy - Reginald d'Aubry. A giant among lovers, a poking, puncturing swordsman, and atop all that an unrivaled diddler of harps and other organs.
Geralt|Mhm… So, what's wrong with it?
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|How should I put this… Ahh, it's lost its jewels.
Geralt|Somebody stole the testicles. Off a statue.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|No ordinary statue, mind you! The sole monument made using a cast of the great Reginald's own genitals - certified and authenticated!
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Sprung directly from his loins, they grant all who stroke them unparalleled virility! All who buy a ticket, that is.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Thus, you must retrieve those stones!
Geralt|Need to look around. Might find a clue or two.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Do what you must, as long as you return grasping Reginald's stones! Without them, Beauclair's entire tourist sector faces trying times, trying times!
Geralt|Any idea when the theft took place?
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|It must have been mere hours ago. I guided the last group through the exposition quite recently. The stones were very much in place.
Geralt|Got any suspects?
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Considering the vast potency of Reginald's prized pouch, everyone's a suspect. Who would not want it for himself?
Geralt|Got my attention. Now tell me about this Reginald, all you know.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|There's so much to tell! Legend has it he and the architect Faramond planned and laid out Beauclair.
Geralt|Mh. Impressed already.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|In particular, Reginald took great pains to devise escape routes for lovers caught with their pants down - literally and metaphorically.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|He later made frequent use of them himself. Not out of fear, mind you, but to avoid having to kill his rivals in duels.
Geralt|Yep. Got them back.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Lebioda's luscious lips, it's them! It's really them! I hope this modest reward nonetheless conveys the extent of my gratitude…
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|And look in on us tomorrow for the grand reopening. You shall stroke Reginald at no charge! On the house!
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|I thank you for your help… Lebioda reward you with copious offspring!
Geralt|Uh, they were destroyed, unfortunately…
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Destroyed…? But--
Geralt|Nothing I could do. Sorry.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|This monument is my life, my livelihood! I've spent years at its side, protecting it from rain, hail, birds and their corrosive droppings…
Geralt|Sounds like you got plenty of experience. Should have no trouble finding another job in the industry…
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|You might think this but a silly statue, but a great many folk depended on those stones.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Fewer children will be born now, ladies will walk about unsatisfied, their men dejected… Not to mention the sad fate of a certain curator of art and collectibles.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Ehh, all is lost.
Geralt|Buck up. You'll figure something out. I'm sure of it. Take care, now.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Well? Have you recovered Reginald's family jewels?
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Please hurry. Beauclair's future lies in the balance. As does mine.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Reginald d'Aubry has returned! Not to be missed! Buy your tickets now! Available from me alone!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Hm. Guess I could say I never found Reginald's stones… But you'd have to be careful, make sure no one figured out you had them.
Toussaint Old Man 01|I shall be the epitome of discretion, on my honor! So, we've a deal?
Geralt|Fine. Keep 'em.
Toussaint Old Man 01|You're priceless! Here, take this coin…
Toussaint Old Man 01|I haven't any more at this moment, but do come back in a week's time. I'll have scraped together twice this amount.
Geralt|Sounds good. See you in a week.
Geralt|No chance. Need to take the stones, pure and simple.
Toussaint Old Man 01|But… but if you were to leave them with me, for a day or two… three at the most!
Geralt|Shit out of luck. Sorry.
Toussaint Old Man 01|At the day's end… it's good I had a chance to use them at all. Here, take them.
Geralt|Thanks. And good luck. Actually think you'll do just fine without them.
Geralt|Perhaps, I… I could lend them to you. For one more day. What would you say to that?
Toussaint Old Man 01|A day is three more romps at the least. You've a deal, sir!
Toussaint Old Man 01|Ugh… Thank you for nothing. You certainly look the fighter, but that's all…
Toussaint Old Man 01|Well, I suppose I must admit it… I stole the stones, but it matters little now… All is lost.
Geralt|What do you mean, lost?
Toussaint Old Man 01|While you were out, Rosalinda's husband came after me… Smashed Reginald's testicles to shards and dust, I'm afraid. They're of no use to anyone, now.
Toussaint Old Man 01|Your work here is done. Now leave me be.
Geralt|I'm back.
Toussaint Old Man 01|Sh-sh-shhh! Not so loud! You'll wake her! She'll want another go!
Geralt|Wake who? Rosalinda?
Toussaint Old Man 01|Louisa, her cousin. She's… she's voracious, got an inexhaustible appetite, but I'm tapped out.
Toussaint Old Man 01|What's it matter that the spirit is willing, when the flesh is simply spent…? My heart near leapt out of my chest last time.
Toussaint Old Man 01|Here, you must take the testes. And Lebioda grant you strength, as I daresay you will need it.
Geralt|You heard me. Calm down or you'll wind up picking your teeth up off the floor.
Toussaint Bandit Strong 01|Tough, are you?! Come here! Come on, you scamp!
Geralt|Ahh, got no time for this… Go home.
Toussaint Bandit Strong 01|Y… yes. That'll be best. I… I'm done here.
Toussaint Old Man 01|I don't know you, but that would have gone horribly for me had you not intervened. I thank you for saving my skin.
Geralt|Mhmm… So, time to talk.
Toussaint Old Man 01|Ah. Rosalinda, my dove, please allow us a moment.
Toussaint Old Man 01|All right, I admit I stole the stones.
Toussaint Old Man 01|And you will never believe it, but… they work! Today, Rosalinda and I… well, three times and counting!
Geralt|Three times…? Impressive.
Toussaint Old Man 01|Isn't it? At my age?! That's more than the entire last decade!
Geralt|All the same, you stole those stones and you gotta return them.
Toussaint Old Man 01|Listen, perhaps we might strike a deal? Hm?
Toussaint Old Man 01|Let me keep the stones. I'll pay you. Grant me this, I beg you. They… they've made me young again!
Geralt|Oop. Sorry to interrupt, I guess…
Toussaint Old Man 01|This… this is not what it seems! Word of honor, I… I tripped, rolled, tumbled, then landed where she already lay!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|Psst! Hughes, that's not him!
Toussaint Old Man 01|I… I swear, this is all an unfortunate coincidence, a series thereof-- What?
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|That's not my husband!
Toussaint Old Man 01|You mean…? Not… not your husband?
Toussaint Old Man 01|Who are you and why are you in my home? Out! Now, or I'll summon the guards!
Geralt|Watch your tone, gramps. Just here to talk.
Toussaint Old Man 01|I… I believe we have nothing to talk about.
Geralt|Oh, we do, we do… Just to kick things off - you're in great form for a man your age.
Toussaint Old Man 01|Ahem… I eat well, start the day with a glass of wine - that preserves a body wonderfully…
Geralt|Interesting, might try it. Say, ever heard of Reginald d'Aubry, his statue?
Toussaint Old Man 01|Pff. Everyone in the city's heard of it. Reginald's a paragon, a national hero.
Geralt|Cut the bullshit, Hughes. You stole Reginald's testicles. Know that already.
Toussaint Old Man 01|I… I can explain everything… This…
Toussaint Bandit Strong 01|Rosalinda! I know you're in there! You and that fancy pants of yours!
Toussaint Old Man 01|Oh, no. Not him, too. This really is not my day…
Toussaint Bandit Strong 01|Got you, you rogue! Prepare for a shellacking, scally-- What the love's this?!
Toussaint Bandit Strong 01|Rosalinda! One I could forgive you… but two at one time?!
Geralt|Wait. Got nothing to do with this.
Toussaint Bandit Strong 01|Hah! Take me for a fool?! I'll teach you to fish in another man's pond!
Geralt|That so…? You seem well-informed, Hughes. Maybe you know who stole Reginald's testicles?
Geralt|Calm down. Just here to talk.
Toussaint Bandit Strong 01|Ugh…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|You're tormented. By what?
Pinastri|Forgive me, but I must ask directly - are you a man? I… I no longer trust my senses.
Geralt|Yes. Meaning, I'm physical, no specter or vision, if that's what you fear. Don't trust your senses? Why?
Pinastri|A foulness, a demon or wraith, haunts me. Grants me no rest. It wants something, I sense this, but know not what. Each day it appears, tarries, then leaves. It's here now - there, beyond the trees.
Geralt|Don't see a thing.
Pinastri|Of course not. It cannot be seen.
Geralt|Yet you see it…?
Pinastri|Only when I drink the brew. Which brings a pain to my head, nausea. But I endure these to keep an eye on the wraith, my tormentor.
Geralt|What's your brew made of? Gotta wonder what's causing such strong visions. You drop in some mushroom? Chumbertub? Dancing dewlap?
Pinastri|Close. The common graytop. I see you know your herbs.
Geralt|Graytop? Variety's extinct, if I recall correctly.
Pinastri|Nearly, but not quite. I was able to grow a few from dried spores. I'd hoped a brew of graytop would reveal this nightmare. I was not wrong.
Geralt|Far as I know, graytop produces some powerful side effects. Though it can, in fact, reveal the hidden, the immaterial…
Pinastri|Yes, I see the evil… Better that than to know it is there, but not know where.
Geralt|Fine. You seem sure something's out there. I'll see what I can do.
Geralt|Start by taking a look around.
Geralt|Need to talk about how much I'll get paid, first.
Pinastri|Is it gold you want?
Geralt|Orens or Novigrad crowns. Florens'll work, too.
Pinastri|I've none of any coin. I've nothing, in fact. Just… potatoes in the cellar. A good crop this year. Tend to this quickly, completely, and several sacks will be yours. Agreed?
Geralt|Don't have a choice, I guess. Potatoes it is, but how many?
Geralt|If that's the case, no pay required. Need those potatoes more than I do.
Geralt|You're taking hallucinogens, a steady diet. Stop and your specter problem'll go away. Farewell.
Geralt|This demon of yours… can you describe it?
Pinastri|It is an enormous horse, its hoof beats pounding in the dark. It gallops to me, stops, stares… then runs on.
Geralt|Sure it's not just a wild horse, run-of-the-mill?
Pinastri|The creature is not of this world. When it gazes at me, a terrible chill pervades my soul.
Pinastri|It is evil condensed, its eyes black, void… Each time it comes, terror grips me, I cease what I'm doing, still my breath and heart.
Geralt|Not exactly. I'm a witcher. Quite a few folk think I don't deserve to be classified as a member of the human species. Know some personally.
Pinastri|A witcher…? But no, nor can you help me.
Geralt|We'll see. Just tell me what the problem is.
Pinastri|Witcher. Will you help me after all?
Pinastri|A king's ransom, that!
Pinastri|I feel we could agree, were you to go a few lower.
Pinastri|Agreed. That many I can spare.
Pinastri|Unthinkable. What good is your aid if I starve come winter? Take what I offer. or begone and leave me in peace.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Common graytop. Strong hallucinogen. Thought extinct - don't often get to see that.
Geralt|Dead moths. Attracted to some ghosts like to the light of a candle.
Geralt|Drops of blood on the pillow. Trail of 'em leading to the window.
Geralt|Medallion's vibrating. Magic nearby. Just can't see a source anywhere.
Pinastri|You were very near to it. It looked at you, then galloped into the woods.
Geralt|Hmm. Seems there's at least some truth to the hermit's ravings.
Geralt|Something drinks the hermit's blood at night, that I know. Gotta talk to her. Maybe she can tell me something more.
Geralt|Trail of blood starts at the pillow, ends here. Medallion's still vibrating.
Geralt|Shutters closed tight. Need to check the other side, see if the trail continues.
Geralt|Yeah… more blood here. Trail leads into the woods.
Geralt|Hermit's corpse… Umbra must've returned. Body's practically drained, not a drop of blood left.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Most likely some kind of wraith's tormenting you. Can't tell what kind, though. Felt weak, spent, lately? Noticed bite marks on your skin?
Pinastri|As I said, I feel weaker by the day. And bites? Of course, there are lice and midges here aplenty…
Geralt|This isn't lice. Something much bigger drinks your blood while you sleep.
Pinastri|But I do not sleep, not a wink. He's always present, always watching - I cannot bear it any longer.
Geralt|Sadly, not much I can do. Can't exterminate it if I can't see it.
Pinastri|The graytop, I shall make a brew of it for you. I've two mushrooms left, enough for one dose. Perhaps then you'll see what I do?
Geralt|Hm. A proper brew could be our only chance to figure this out.
Geralt|All right. High time we tried this.
Geralt|If I start muttering something about unicorns or sorceresses… ignore it.
Geralt|Need to tend to something else, first. We'll do this another time.
Geralt|This mushroom, even in me, could produce some nasty, unpredictable side effects.
Pinastri|True, there is no knowing how graytop would effect a mutated body.
Geralt|Listen, about the specter…
Pinastri|Back at last. I thought you'd not return.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Don't see no wraith.
Abel Lupo|Mmm, wow… this clover's amazing. Now that's what I call a bouquet.
Geralt|Who said that?
Abel Lupo|Oh, you're awake. Had me worried, you were out way too long. Even considered giving you some White Honey. Kinda hard to do with hooves, though.
Geralt|Roach…?
Geralt|Must be the brew that did this. Interesting side effect…
Abel Lupo|Great, isn't it? You should take this stuff more often - got so many pointers I could give you!
Geralt|Can't, sadly. Drinking this too often could prove fatal.
Geralt|Listen, got this contract I need to finish before the brew wears off.
Abel Lupo|Right, monster won't slay itself. Let me see. First up, I need to know what we're dealing with.
Abel Lupo|Follow me. And try not to trample any plants or small animals.
Geralt|Hey, know how you always show up when I whistle? How's that work, exactly?
Abel Lupo|Well, you're my human. Gotta be there when you need me. Yes, I'll be there for you-ou-ou, as the world falls down.
Geralt|Still kinda strange - how you cross the ocean when I call sometimes, but then get hung up on the tiniest fence. What's that about?
Abel Lupo|What can I say? Everyone's got limits.
Geralt|Your voice, it's, uh, interesting. Gotta say I expected a young mare to sound, uh, girlish.
Abel Lupo|Based on what? Your vast experience with talking animals? Far as I know, I'm your first.
Geralt|Good point.
<|endoftext|>
Abel Lupo|Oh, fuck! Geralt! Watch out!
Abel Lupo|Good gods, what's with the overgrown demon cats?! Heeeelp!
Abel Lupo|There's the umbra! Let's go, Geralt! After it!
Abel Lupo|Heh, heard this one? Horse walks into a tavern, and the innkeep says--
Abel Lupo|"Hey, pal, why the long face"? HAH!
Abel Lupo|Hey, gotta save my strength a bit. No telling how long we're gonna need to keep running.
Abel Lupo|Slowing… down. Gotta catch my breath.
Abel Lupo|Geralt, we need the catch the umbra. It gets away now, we'll never see it again, no matter how many doped-up slurries you guzzle.
Abel Lupo|Melted into thin air…
Abel Lupo|Some kind of glowy magic thing going on with this tombstone. We should check it out.
Abel Lupo|Geralt, we gotta have a man-to-horse talk. No offense, but your riding skills? They leave a bit to be desired, buddy.
Abel Lupo|You'd really do me a solid if you could, uh, apply a slightly surer hand, be a little more decisive about where you want me to go.
Abel Lupo|Sometimes, I got no idea, buddy. Do I go left, right, twerk where I'm standing…?
Geralt|Yeah, and it'd be great if could respond more fluidly to my commands…
Abel Lupo|Let's not lose sight of that umbra. Can you see it now?
Geralt|Yeah, its' right there. Run, Roach!
Abel Lupo|What the fuck do you think I'm doing?!
Geralt|Long as we're being candid, I gotta ask. Why do you sometimes buck me off in the middle of a fight?
Abel Lupo|First I've heard. Don't recall that ever happening.
Geralt|Course you don't.
Abel Lupo|Geralt, please, no hocus-pocus.
Abel Lupo|Oh, shit! Sorry, man. You all right?!
<|endoftext|>
Abel Lupo|Geralt, we gotta inspect this area closely. I'll look for clues. You stand there and… well, just stand.
Geralt|Right.
Abel Lupo|Will you look at that!
Geralt|Don't see anything here.
Abel Lupo|These're hoof prints. Not just any old horse's, either. These were left by an astral being, otherworldly. We gotta follow them.
Abel Lupo|Geralt, look! This here's definitely a clue.
Geralt|Dead moths - often mean a phantom's nearby.
Abel Lupo|Thanks, Captain Obvious. Now what about the smell? Same whiff I caught at the cemetery in Vizima, when we were hunting ghouls.
Abel Lupo|The smell of… death.
Geralt|Smells normal to me… Not taking me for a ride, are you?
Abel Lupo|Uh seriously?
Abel Lupo|All right, now I know what we're up against.
<|endoftext|>
Abel Lupo|Right, Geralt. Let's sum up what we know so far.
Geralt|We're dealing with some kind of wraith or phantom, most likely. It visits the hermit at night, drinks her blood.
Geralt|Even if we manage to find it, I've got no idea how I could possibly fight it.
Abel Lupo|Geralt, please, I got this. It's definitely an umbra, an immaterial wraith. This one's assumed the form of a horse.
Geralt|An umbra… Actually makes sense. Umbrae are completely invisible, even to witchers. But how can you be sure?
Abel Lupo|Because it's not invisible to me, doofus. It's right over there!
Abel Lupo|It's getting away! C'mon witcher, hop in the saddle! Gotta catch it!
Geralt|Don't know much. It's a spirit of some sort, torments the hermit for some unknown reason. It's immaterial, so I've got no idea how to fight it.
Geralt|If we can even find it, that is.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Marcello Clerici. Knight. Died last year. Was more or less the same age as our hermit.
Geralt|Seems his spirit's become a horse-shaped umbra that's tormenting Pinastri.
Abel Lupo|Why're you telling me this? I can read. And draw my own conclusions.
Geralt|Thinking aloud, that's all. Helps me focus.
Abel Lupo|Geralt! It's the umbra! Attack!
Knight Spirit|Let me explain!
Geralt|Talk. But make it fast. Why're you tormenting the hermit?
Knight Spirit|She torments me! Refuses to forgive me. I'm denied peace in the afterlife, and it's all her doing. Each day I come and beg her for clemency!
Geralt|Beg her for clemency? You drink her blood, drive her mad with fear.
Knight Spirit|I don't know how to explain it, but yes, a monstrous force takes me. Though I also know I'll not have peace till the day Pinastri forgives me.
Geralt|Must've hurt her something awful if she refuses to forgive you, would rather see you suffer. What'd you do?
Knight Spirit|To her? Nothing. But my horse, I… I flogged it to death. Pinastri, she saw this.
Knight Spirit|A proud stallion, my Blaze. But he was a bucker, and tossed me during a tourney. One I'd wanted to win badly!
Knight Spirit|Pinastri had been so glad they'd let me stand - me, a peasant's son. I wanted to win it for her. But that horse made me lose. Rage overcame me… I struck and struck, until at last he fell.
Knight Spirit|Oh, the regret! I beg you, forgive me. Absolve me in Blaze's very name.
Geralt|Can't forgive you for that - not in my power.
Knight Spirit|But your horse could. Please, I'd do anything, I'm desperate… Help me.
Knight Spirit|Noble mare! Forgive me my sin!
Geralt|Could free his spirit, pardoning him on behalf of his horse.
Geralt|But you shouldn't do it if you don't think he deserves forgiveness.
Abel Lupo|Did a rotten thing. Got no excuse. Your horse was loyal, did the best damn job he could, 'cause that's how we horses are.
Knight Spirit|True… I know I deserved what befell me.
Abel Lupo|But we aren't vengeful, don't hold grudges, don't dwell on being left in monster-infested woods… So in your poor Blaze's name, I forgive you.
Knight Spirit|Oh, thank you! I feel… it's incredible! Such relief, such lightness…
Geralt|Anyone who flogs a horse to death on account of some silly tourney deserves a fate this bad.
Abel Lupo|Let's kick his astral ass, Geralt! For Blaze!
Geralt|Poor hermit. Won't let you torment her again.
Geralt|You and the hermit, how do you know each other?
Knight Spirit|We met as babes, grew up side by side. I… I loved her… yet she was always sad, nothing could cheer her. The world terrified her. I thought her gloom came from being poor, so I did my damndest to take us from our village, make us a better life elsewhere.
Knight Spirit|Became a squire, took her with me to the palace. But Pinastri soon learned nobles are no more decent than peasants, not a speck.
Knight Spirit|Once even I'd grown vile to her eyes, she fled the palace and joined the flagellants.
Knight Spirit|I left the court to be near her. Yet she cast me off, said she didn't want to know me.
Knight Spirit|When the whip-bearers proved too hard-hearted for her, too, she became a hermit. I see it clearly now… though I never understood her while alive.
Knight Spirit|From the grave's dark depth, the living are bright, sharp flares. You see all their thoughts at once. Now I understand why she had to cast me off…
Geralt|Hm, she's full of rage. Probably what turned you into an umbra.
Geralt|Why take the form of a horse?
Knight Spirit|A horse? What do you mean? Each day since I died, a power lifts me from my grave and makes me run…
Knight Spirit|Then I return with blood in my mouth.
Knight Spirit|I don't know what this is… how it comes to pass. But I do know the torment will continue until she forgives me.
Knight Spirit|But she sees me as a horse, you say?
Geralt|Seems so. Same way I saw you.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Phantom's gone. Shouldn't torment you ever again.
Pinastri|I felt a change, I did, as if I'd been released from a cramped, dank cellar.
Pinastri|I had come to believe no one could help me. I'm grateful, witcher.
Pinastri|I'm well aware witchers work for hire, for pay. But I've no coin, alas. I can offer only this…
Geralt|Hmm… Potatoes?
Pinastri|A good crop this year. Exceptional.
Geralt|Oughta thank my horse, actually. Phantom's departure - mostly Roach's doing.
Pinastri|Then I thank you, too, noble creature.
Abel Lupo|Gotta admit - easy-peasy with our powers combined. So what now? We hit the Path? Ride to the nearest notice board, rustle up another contract…?
Geralt|Exactly. Though, effects of the brew're waning, I can feel it. Won't be able to understand you, soon.
Abel Lupo|Grrr… that's horseshit. I mean, I got so much more I want to tell you, and… Hmmppphrr…
Pinastri|Clever beasts, horses. Farewell, witcher.
Pinastri|As agreed - your reward. With my thanks.
Geralt|Drove off the phantom. But it'll be back sooner or later. It'll keep coming till you forgive Marcello his deed.
Geralt|It's his specter that torments you.
Pinastri|I will never forgive him! Never! Petty rage drove him to torture that innocent beast to death! He's an evil man who deserves no mercy.
Geralt|He'll never let you rest if you don't forgive him.
Pinastri|I cannot forgive him. He'll get no pardon from me… If I, too, must suffer for his sin, so be it. Such is my fate.
Pinastri|Yet still, I thank you for your help. Knowing the cause grants me some respite. There's that, at least.
Geralt|Don't wanna forgive him, don't have to. But if that's the case, draw salt lines along your threshold, on your window sills. Might keep him out.
Pinastri|As agreed - take this. For your trouble.
Geralt|Phantom you told me about… still your tormentor?
Pinastri|No, all is well. I thank you for your help. So much.
Geralt|But I… I didn't do anything.
Pinastri|I was talking to Roach. Your horse helped me, told me my tormentor was a friend who had passed recently. Failing to find peace in the afterlife, he'd returned as a specter.
Geralt|Roach solved your problem herself?
Pinastri|That's right. And quickly! Oh, now she asks that I convey to you her regards.
Geralt|Hmm. Thanks. Take care, now.
Geralt|Phantom you told me about… still your tormentor?
Pinastri|It does. Grants me no rest…
Geralt|Sorry. Didn't manage to catch it.
Pinastri|And I wasted my stock of graytop to make you that brew. I knew from the start it wouldn't work. I fear there's no hope left for me, now. Begone.
Abel Lupo|I did what I had to.
Geralt|Right. Agreed. Let's head back to the hermit's.
Abel Lupo|Heheh. All right, then. Guess we might as well head back. Pinastri's nights oughta be ghost-free from now on. Anything to add, Geralt?
Geralt|Nope. Let's go see her.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Area's dangerous. I'd say there's a basilisk nesting around here. You'd be wise to remain at some distance.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Yes, I'm familiar with the matter. And quite proud to say a basilisk does nest here! I look after it, personally!
Geralt|Look after it? It's not exactly a pet. Beast's murdering folk who come through here.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Just a minute. It does not murder those who do not trespass upon its territory.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|I posted a number of signs! Warnings! Specifically to prevent anyone from coming to any harm!
Geralt|Well, a lot of good they did. Got a freshly mangled corpse right here.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Most likely a merchant, the poor bloke. Just today I learned two traders had chosen this route despite the signs. I came as quick as I could to warn them. Too late, alas…
Toussaint Noble Man 02|I've instructed my servants. They shall take the body, return it to the family with a generous sum as recompense.
Geralt|Where's the basilisk nesting, any idea?
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Of course I've an idea. But you don't really expect me to tell you. Those are not toy swords, I know your intentions.
Geralt|Find it myself, then. Easy to track with its distinct paw prints. Mentioned two merchants, so I might also look for the other corpse.
Geralt|Hm. Pay the victims' families compensation? Why?
Toussaint Noble Man 02|These lands have been my family's for decades, granted to us by Duchess Ademarta. Beyond them, the basilisk ventures not, hunts not, it does not kill or destroy.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Provided it is not provoked. Yet if it does destroy, if it kills, I compensate all for their loss. From my own coffers.
Geralt|Huh. Your coffers. Got a store of sons and husbands in there, to compensate for those shredded by your beast?
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Naturally, I cannot revive the dead… But I do make generous restitution to their loved ones. Just last summer, I paid a leather tooler's widow eight hundred crowns.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|This unfortunate merchant's family - to be duly indemnified as well.
Geralt|Claim this to be the last surviving basilisk? How do you figure?
Toussaint Noble Man 02|The last of this subspecies. Their population was much larger at one time, see, before the beech forests were felled.
Geralt|Mean to suggest a direct correlation between beechwood forest density and basilisk populations?
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Indirect, I'd prefer to contend. Beechwood forests are the chief habitat of roe deer, you see, in turn a staple of the basilisk diet.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|When roe deer grew scarce, basilisks made humans their staple food. Enter the witchers.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|And thus we've come to this one, last specimen. It's a female. As recently as last year, we still had two. But Iocaste's mate passed on, alas.
Geralt|Iocaste?
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Should she not have a name? My father dubbed her, in honor of my dear departed mother. Iocaste was brooding then - two eggs. That she cast from her nest, alas, when the male perished.
Geralt|Who exactly are you? And how'd you develop such an interest in the beast?
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Count Borhis - happy to be of service. As to the beast, well, this subspecies is our dynastic symbol. The di Salvaresses have for centuries signed with the Regulus Platinum.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|As family legend has it, a female of the species rescued an ancestor, a boy at the time, from a burning building. She took the tyke back to her nest, where she fed him as if he were one of her own youngsters.
Geralt|Malarkey.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|To be sure. But beautiful malarkey it is.
Geralt|You post those warnings?
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Indeed. To prevent anyone from coming to any harm.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Poor man. A horrid death, truly…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Bloodstains. Clear as day.
Geralt|Basilisk scales're usually thicker, not nearly so fine. Could be more sensitive to fire, this one.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Alas, it is true. Iocaste has a terrible fear of fire. She's a highly sensitive creature. Rid your mind of any thought to kill her - you would destroy the last of a species!
Geralt|Busted barrels, content spilled all over. Must've been tannin in there, used to treat leather.
Geralt|Beast smashed the barrels. That's how the scent go on the scale.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Iococo is so very curious. Strong scents, especially, intrigue her. The barrels - they must have drawn her in, drawn her to the caravan.
Geralt|Strange, these burn marks. Beast's venom make them? Subspecies must be highly toxic.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|It is so indeed. A wound from a sterling basilisk festers long.
Geralt|Need to brew a potion that'll neutralize that.
Geralt|Busted barrels slimed with venom. Hallmarks of an attack. Basilisk must've caught the second victim here.
Geralt|Anyway, got two scents - venom and tannin. Oughta be enough to track the beast.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Why track her at all? Iocaste is protected! Her death would forever destabilize the ecosystem. Who knows what would happen. I see unforeseeable consequences down the line.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Simply refrain from provoking her! Harm her not, and she, too, will leave you untouched.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|I've long suspected they do it on purpose - scent their goods. They seek to lure the basilisk to destroy their wares. It allows them to demand compensation from their assurers.
Geralt|Just as I expected. Second victim… but relatively unscathed. Basilisk must've been dragging him back to its nest for later. Dropped him for some reason.
Geralt|Wonder why.
Geralt|Hear something, but it's no basilisk's screech. Human voices?
Geralt|Scale. Color's unusual. Silver? Never seen one like this.
Geralt|Odor's dispersed, seems to be everywhere. Basilisk must be high in the sky.
Geralt|Scent's perceptible again.
Geralt|Scale's scent is intense. Is that *sniff*… tannin?
<|endoftext|>
Temerian Bandit 01|Jamor, Auwry, prepare the equipment. Beast's wandered off somewheres. We gotsta lure it back.
Temerian Bandit 01|And who might you be?
Geralt|Funny. About to ask you the same.
Temerian Bandit 01|They call us the Reavers.
Geralt|Reavers? Wouldn't happen to hail from Crinfrid, would you?
Temerian Bandit 01|Aye, we do. But how's it you know? And again - who the hell are you?
Geralt|Geralt of Rivia. I'm a witcher. Know your brethren in arms - Boholt, Kennet and Desbrut. Newboy, too.
Temerian Bandit 03|Aaah, you're that witcher! Aye, Boholt mentioned you. Said you swing a mean sword.
Temerian Bandit 01|A professional. Good you came along. Can take on the brute together. Talk is the venom's somethin' horrifyin'.
Temerian Bandit 01|Could use another pair of hands. Fee what we've gotten from the guild, we'll share it fair and square. You in?
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Gentlemen, this hurts my ears and pains my heart! You aim to kill Iocaste? It cannot be! The creature is protected!
Toussaint Noble Man 02|If you fear to lose the guild's reward, I shall repay it. And reward you doubly to leave the beast be! You cannot slay the last living specimen of a near extinct subspecies.
Temerian Bandit 03|Willin' to pay, are you? Long as we do nothin'? That's rather novel. What say you to that, master? Far as I know, beast's culled the human race by five already.
Geralt|Beast has to die. We work together, we'll make quick work of it.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|After all I told you of Iocaste, you would murder her?! Oh, you will regret this, friend! I know folk! I shall tell them you slew the last surviving specimen!
Geralt|Sorry, master di Salvaress. Actually, not sorry. A monster's a monster. Silvery, plaid or polka-dotted… last or next-to-last specimen - doesn't matter. It's a dangerous predator that kills humans. Enough said.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Herbalists, alchemists - I know many! They will despise you! I shall tell them of a heartless cur who cares not an ounce for balance in nature. You shall pay arms and legs for their wares. More!
Temerian Bandit 01|Somebody plug this lordlin's gob, eh? Right, master witcher. How do we aim to fight the filth?
Temerian Bandit 01|We've crossbows. Could ply it with bolts while you do the hack and slash. Or all go at it as a bunch, blades in hand, fire in our hearts. You decide, you're the one with experience.
Geralt|Use your crossbows. Keep her on the ground. Good idea.
Temerian Bandit 02|D'you say "her"?
Geralt|It's a female, yeah.
Temerian Bandit 01|Hear that, lads? We've a learned witcher here. A hundred spans out an' he's spotted what the lizard's got between its legs.
Temerian Bandit 01|Right, now, lads. You've heard the specialist. Ready your crossbows.
Geralt|All good and fine, but the monster's not in its nest. Gotta track it down first.
Temerian Bandit 01|Not at all necessary, Geralt. We looked into it, gave it a think. Traders used tannin to lure the beast. Who says we can't do the same?
Geralt|You got any tannin?
Temerian Bandit 02|Came into a bit, aye. Here! Willin' to do the honors?
Geralt|There.
Temerian Bandit 01|Grab your ballies! Shoot the bitch down!
Geralt|We'll go at it as a bunch. Just stay clear of my sword.
Temerian Bandit 01|Right, now, lads. You've heard the specialist.
Geralt|Basilisk lives for now. We're not gonna kill it.
Temerian Bandit 02|A witcher defendin' a beast? Ever seen that, lads? You like them peaches?
Temerian Bandit 01|Argh… No scrappin' with filth today, it seems. But, but… you made some mention o' coin, as I recall.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|I did indeed. And a word once given…
Temerian Bandit 01|Your share, witcher.
Temerian Bandit 03|Hahaha! Easiest job I've ever done. Godspeed, witcher. Strange workin' with you. Strange but nice.
Geralt|Godspeed, boys.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|You spared Iocaste, I thank you. And be assured I'll take great care she not dine on any other souls.
Geralt|Gotta try harder, figure out a way to keep folk out of this area.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|That I shall do. Master, you must accept more, be it a symbolic sum. Had you not come along, the Reavers would surely have slain my Iocaste.
Geralt|Thanks.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Iocaste has flown her nest.
Geralt|Must've sensed a threat. Likely to return eventually, though.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|She'll return. Always does. I suspect I might even know where she's gone. I tracked her a way and believe she might have found a new mate. It's an ordinary basilisk, not a silvery one…
Toussaint Noble Man 02|But something might come of it, who knows. Iocaste could lay new eggs. Perhaps produce an entirely new crossbreed?
Geralt|Sure hope not. Take care.
Geralt|Don't need any more. Rather you paid it out to the families of your pet's victims.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Noble of you, master. I shall take the advice to heart.
Geralt|Neither's your concern.
Temerian Bandit 01|No concern of ours, you say… Perhaps not. But we've got eyes… and can see those razors you got on your back right clear.
Temerian Bandit 03|He's a witcher. Boholt and his boys, he's their mate. Heard of him. Geralt of Rivia's the name.
Geralt|Corpse… a mercenary's, seems. Shredded. Basilisk has left its nest, clearly.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Butchers! This is barbarous! What did she ever do to you?! Stop! My Iocaste! Do not slay her!
Temerian Bandit 01|Wretch's got somethin' in that skulls of 'ers. Not about to roost in its nest with warriors on the prowl after it.
Temerian Bandit 03|It's afeared, all right. On account it senses we're true Reavers!
Temerian Bandit 02|Damned right!
<|endoftext|>
Temerian Bandit 01|A stroke of luck, that, to fight at a true witcher's side! Prime the way you swung that razor, mate.
Geralt|Mentioned some fee from a guild? I hear you right?
Temerian Bandit 01|Hah! Witcher drives right for the gut! A professional, right thorough. Your share, friend. Every last copper, as we agreed.
Temerian Bandit 01|We'll collect us a few of them silver scales and the tail. Proof for the guild, right?
Temerian Bandit 02|An' we'll get word o' you to some folk, merchant folk, meanin'. They ought to treat you right.
Geralt|Thanks. And farewell.
Temerian Bandit 01|We've got a damn good reason to celebrate!
Temerian Bandit 02|Basilisk beat, quick and thorough - that augurs well.
Temerian Bandit 03|That was some fine twirling, feet and blade, witcher.
Temerian Guard 01|Vermin's tail - could do with a bit of that. Roasted, served with fresh collard greens.
Temerian Bandit 02|Look at m'Lordlin', sobbin' over the vermin filth.
Temerian Bandit 01|Let him be, Jamor. Blubbered a fair bit yourself when wolves nabbed your Helmet.
Temerian Bandit 02|What do you mean? You sayin' we's like them wolves?
Temerian Bandit 01|No, muttonhead. Beast were to the noble what Helmet were to you.
Temerian Bandit 03|Basilisk as a pet, a hunting dog? The notion were wrong to start with.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Iocaste, my poor Iocaste. Cruelly slaughtered like a common beast…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Fine, see what I can learn. Now, if you have to come with me, just one request - stay out of the way. Mine and my sword's.
Le Papillon|Of course, you shan't even notice me. Jean-Louis' studio is just there, right here. Aaaaaagh!
Geralt|What's the matter?
Le Papillon|I've hit upon the perfect ending - "And all for the glory of Her Grace, the Duchess"!
Geralt|Thought this was about a witcher and a coiffeur. What's the duchess got to do with it?
Le Papillon|Her Grace can be as fickle as the colts she rides. Today, all remember my fine couplets at the tourney. Yet tomorrow, Her Illustriousness, bored by her breakfast, might demand a new epic poem. One most grab at opportunity before it flits away.
Le Papillon|Well, then - where shall we start?
Geralt|At the door. By breaking it down.
Le Papillon|Her Illustriousness was always so very kind to me. My poem I've decided to dedicate to her martyrdom.
Geralt|What happened, exactly? Claim the hairdresser's missing - but're you sure?
Le Papillon|Yes, yes, I've no doubt something's transpired, something terrible, absurd! Jean-Louis's never late to work - he's punctual to a fault.
Le Papillon|I'm certain he'll be honored if I am the one to sing of his dramatic rescue.
Geralt|Who's gonna pay me to find this barber?
Le Papillon|I will. Such opportunities come knocking rarely. But you must take me with you, for I must transcribe all that occurs as it happens.
Geralt|Fine, but… unusual as contracts go. It'll cost you more.
Le Papillon|Naturally. To be expected.
Geralt|No chance. Got my hands full with just one screwy troubadour in my life.
Le Papillon|You've an exclusivity contract with Dandelion - is that it?
Geralt|Something along those lines. So long.
Geralt|See you.
Geralt|Hm, thanks.
Le Papillon|…of Master Dandelion! I know the bard's every ballad in his cycle about the witcher. Oh, I cannot believe my luck!
Geralt|Need something - from me?
Le Papillon|Indeed - a matter most magnificent. My coiffeur, Jean-Louis Ludovic, has gone missing! Now you shall rescue him, while I compose an epic ballad about it!
Le Papillon|Listen, fair folk, to a glorious tale, of a missing friseur and a witcher who'd prevail!
Le Papillon|You've changed your mind, have you? Shan't regret it, you'll see. You need but do what you always do, while I write and sing of it.
Le Papillon|Yes, by all means. As you wish.
Le Papillon|Ravix of Fourhorn! So content to see you! Le Papillon, troubadour - remember?
Geralt|Hey there. Know what? The… whole… Ravix thing. Only ever a joke. Call me Geralt, please.
Le Papillon|Geralt of Rivia? Naturally! How did it ever escape me?! You must know I'm a devoted fan…
Le Papillon|Geralt! So content to see you! Le Papillon, troubadour - remember?
Geralt|Hey there.
Le Papillon|I've never found the opportune moment, see, never had a chance, in fact, to say I'm a devoted fan…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Empty pomade jar… Strong floral fragrance. Akh akh. Ugh, very strong.
Le Papillon|That's Jean-Louis' Special Floral Elixir! Recipe's a jealously guarded secret.
Geralt|Hmm… looks like he ran out.
Geralt|The coiffeur's log… A manicure, curling, Cintrian pendulum, Rivian ponytail, raftsman's do. Hm, long out of style in Novigrad.
Geralt|Ah, his appointments. Last one was a certain… Lady le Pompidou. Know her?
Le Papillon|Yes, a dear old bird. Jean-Louis's done her hair for a decade. Completely harmless.
Geralt|Sketch here, looks like a map. This mean anything to you?
Le Papillon|Hmm. I may understand where it points. But if so, there's naught there. Just fields and meadows…
Geralt|Mhhh.
Geralt|Think I understand--
Le Papillon|As do I! Perhaps.
Le Papillon|Around he looked, yet all was quite proper. "I see razors, pomades, but no blasted hair-chopper!"
Geralt|Mind being quiet for a minute? Think I might know what happened to the hairdresser.
Geralt|No evidence of a break-in, no signs of a struggle. To my mind, he just went out to find ingredients for his pomade. Looks like he ran out… of pomade.
Le Papillon|Yes, indeed! He'd have gone into the meadows beyond the city to gather flower petals for it. Trolls must have devoured him! Or a cyclops! Splendid, either way!
Geralt|Think you could find the place using his map?
Le Papillon|Naturally.
Geralt|Lead the way, then.
Geralt|Lock's untouched. No attempt at forced entry.
Geralt|This jar's empty, too.
Geralt|Hm, scissors're completely dull. No way he could use these to cut hair.
Geralt|Dried flowers. Pretty fragrant, still…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Dammit! Get back!
Le Papillon|Aaa! Save me! Witcher!
Le Papillon|Oh no! Foul bandits have bound our stylist in chains! Little do they know they'll be punished, in pain.
Geralt|Quiet down!
Le Papillon|This is the spot. No trace of Jean-Louis, though.
Geralt|Not true. Look, grass is trampled. Someone's picked flowers here recently. Need to look around.
Geralt|Someone was led through here…
Le Papillon|I hope Jean-Louis has suffered something appropriately epic.
Le Papillon|I shall wait here. Hm, a rhyme for "Duchess"… Something elegant… "Fruit most luscious"?
Le Papillon|And all for the glory of Her Grace, the Duchess!
Le Papillon|And all… ahem. And all for the glory of Her Grace, the Duchess!
Le Papillon|What beast was that?
Geralt|An archespore.
Le Papillon|Might there be more nearby?
Geralt|Who knows.
Le Papillon|And your sharpened senses, what do they say?
Geralt|That you'd rather turn and run.
Le Papillon|Hahaha, a primo jest! Let us continue onward. I know you'll stand in my defense. You will, will you not?
Le Papillon|Ah, you're here! I believe I've found Jean-Louis, our friseur! Now you must merely save his hide.
Le Papillon|But you must take the fore, agreed?
Le Papillon|I dedicate this ballad to our stately… no, our magnanimous and gracious ruler…
Le Papillon|… a tale glory-strewed! Of a missing friseur and a witcher most lewd! No, that's not right.
Geralt|A basket of flower petals. Same smell as the pomade…
Le Papillon|My, a dark so dark as to prod one to fear…
Geralt|Fear uninspiring? No rhymes at the ready?
Le Papillon|Remember, you must win! I've already written the ending!
Le Papillon|Never fear, I'm noting it all down!
Le Papillon|Ooh, that was good! Do it again!
Le Papillon|There! Jean-Louis' basket! I'd recognize it anywhere! He was here, we can be certain now!
Le Papillon|A clue! I think I've found one!
Le Papillon|No, no, seems not.
Le Papillon|Oh! Here! Here! This looks just like a clue!
Le Papillon|So? On his trail yet, are you?
Geralt|Grass is trampled. Multiple sets of footprints… a little blood.
Geralt|Seems you were right. He ran into trouble.
Le Papillon|Phew, what luck. I just hope it's not cyclopes. Hard pressed to find a rhyme for that.
Le Papillon|On to the second point on the map!
Le Papillon|Geraaaaalt! Come back!
Le Papillon|Don't leave me here!
Le Papillon|Oh, you naughty boy, scaring poor Le Papillon like that. But it's all right. Back to our investigation.
Le Papillon|I dedicate this ballad to the memory of our stately… no, our magnanimous and gracious ruler…
Le Papillon|Behold, the location from the map.
Le Papillon|Aaa! Geralt! Kill it!
Le Papillon|No! Stay away! You'll draw it towards me!
Le Papillon|Seidhe Llygad shone in its azure glow, sand marking time's lackadaisical flow.
Le Papillon|They ventured beyond walls by vines entwined, into the unknown, the poor barber to find.
Geralt|Gonna do that the whole way?
Le Papillon|Bidding them farewell, the gravestones moss-covered, they strode briskly on, by doubts unencumbered.
Geralt|Uuughhh…
Le Papillon|The witcher's blade flashed, juices spouted and poured, covering all about in an archespore's gore.
Le Papillon|No piece of the stylist fell from its bowels, the friseur had been nabbed by ought else most foul.
Geralt|Ground's made of rock, trail's gone cold. Wandered deeper into the cave.
Geralt|Grass is trampled. Multiple sets of footprints… a little blood. Someone attacked him.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Doesn't seem terribly chivalrous. What about honor, your oath on the peacock, all that?
Beau Duvall|I do vow on the noble bird I shall gut you if you do not skedaddle!
Beau Duvall|En garde! Stand and fight! I challenge thee! And you boys dare not intervene! By golly, by gum, this will be chivalrous!
Le Papillon|Listen, children, a story you shall hear, of a witcher who walloped a rogue knight's derriere!
Geralt|It's hair. It'll grow back. Really wanna kill a man because he gave you a bad cut?
Beau Duvall|And who are you, gadabout, to lecture me, a heraldic lord?! We've a bleeding champion of the oppressed, men.
Beau Duvall|At him!
Beau Duvall|Pure poppycock, you beard mangler! The latest rage! In some bumbotched Kovir?! We're in Nilfgaard, you bungmunch!
Geralt|What'd he do to you?
Beau Duvall|What did he do? He coiffed me. Gave me a duck's arse, an ape drape, a beaver paddle! I don't even know! So ashamed I couldn't attend the tourney!
Beau Duvall|I'd have proved my valor! Mademoiselle Vivienne de Tabris my prize! Then this scalawag with his talk of the rage! Missed my chance by the hair on my head!
Geralt|Got him back good, from what I can see.
Beau Duvall|That is but the start. I've not yet decided if I shouldn't snip off something more.
Beau Duvall|Hands down I would have won that tourney. And had Mademoiselle Vivienne already warming my bed!
Beau Duvall|"Trust me, sir knight, this coif is the latest rage. At the Koviri court they'll have nothing else. No damsel will manage to resist." Bollobobs!
Le Papillon|Not so close! I require a broad view of the action!
<|endoftext|>
Le Papillon|They froze in their fear, the knight's henchmen and squires, while his bowels set loose, heavenward spiraled.
Le Papillon|The witcher cleft him, in two lacerated, his next swing the swine adroitly castrated.
Le Papillon|With one more caress from the witcher's blade, the knight's gut plopped out, his breakfast betrayed.
Le Papillon|Then he hobbled apace, on his stump arms like crutches, all for the glory of Her Grace, the Duchess!
Geralt|Bravo. Almost believed you were there.
Le Papillon|Doesn't it seem so? At last, Master Dandelion has a worthy competitor!
Geralt|What about my pay?
Le Papillon|I've decided you should receive a reasonable share of the royalties. Payable, let us say… semi-annually?
Geralt|Meaning you're broke just now.
Jean Louis Ludovic|Ahem. I owe you a thousand thanks, master witcher. I-I'll gladly pay your reward. Not to mention trimming you when you see the need and come by.
Geralt|Hm. Thanks. Take care, now.
Geralt|Think you got confused. Sure you saw all that?
Le Papillon|Forgive me, witcher, but poetry's hardly your forte. In fact, you know squat. Today's audiences demand high drama, and I provide it.
Toussaint Squire 01|It's grown rather late. I believe we'll be on our way…
Jean Louis Ludovic|Le Papillon? Lebioda's wounds! You saved me, at the last second!
Geralt|You're welcome. Jean-Louis Ludovic, I presume. Let's get out of here before he--
Le Papillon|Quiet, both of you! I've got it!
Le Papillon|Then he hobbled apace, on his stump arms like crutches, all for the glory of Her Grace, the Duchess!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What's this about?
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|Monsters! Monsters, there, in the cave!
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|We managed to flee. But Hugo remains inside!
Geralt|Hugo?
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|Our brother! He's still in there, inside!
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|Help us! Find him! We'll pay you for your toil!
Geralt|Fine. I'll look for him. You two stay out here.
Geralt|I could look into it… but it'll cost you.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|How much would you take?
Geralt|Come on. You two made it out. Your brother will too. I'm not needed here.
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|But--
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|It's no use, Auguste. The witcher clearly refuses to aid us. Perhaps another will read the notice, come along.
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|But should you change your mind, we'll be waiting here!
Geralt|You post that notice? About an escort?
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|Yes, we did! And not without cause, it seems! We waited some days, yet when none answered, we risked the expedition unaccompanied.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Fools we were. We'd have done better to show patience, wait… Poor Hugo - left to an unknown fate!
Geralt|Notice what attacked you?
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|There was no time! We ran for the exit as soon as we felt the earth quiver! But Hugo, well, he went the other way.
Geralt|So, monsters crawl out of the ground?
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|I… I suppose… In truth, I don't know. We just ran, did not look back.
Geralt|Why'd you even go in there?
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|We… lost our way…
Geralt|Mh. Mistake that cave for the highroad?
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|By the hair on my chinny chin chin, what difference does it make whether we went for a stroll or to gather sewants? Hugo remains inside, in grave danger! That's what matters!
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Will you go in after him or not? Every second could be vital!
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|You're back! Will you find Hugo? Save him?
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|He's still in there! Alone! He'll likely die if you don't help!
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|Alas, that is not an amount we could ever muster. Might you take a little less?
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|This, this is more than we hoped to spend, but minimally so. Might you drop your price a bit?
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|A reasonable price.
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|We are not fashioned of gold. We cannot afford this amount.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Problem solved. Now to find Hugo.
Geralt|Kikimores. Dammit.
Geralt|You Hugo? Your brothers sent me.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Pshaw! Dizzards! Scoundrels! Tartmongers! They attacked me, but I fended them off. Now they send a brigand to finish the job?!
Geralt|What're you talking about? Ran into them outside. Claimed monsters attacked. They ran, made it out, but you got stuck inside. They asked me to help you.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Is that what they told you? The lying weasels… More trickery on their part, I'm certain!
Geralt|Whoa, slow down. What's this about?
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Ehh. I'm Hugo Monnart. My father, Victor Monnart, you may have heard of. A cognac distiller he was, famed for it.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Before he passed, my brothers and I would quarrel over who would inherit the family business. So Father decided he would "force" us to work together.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|He broke his still down into its parts. Three of them he hid, telling each of us the location of one.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|When my brothers learned "my" part, the last, was hidden in here, they decided they did not need me anymore. They decided to cut me out of the business - literally.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|We argued, fought… The noise must have woken the beasts. My brothers ran for the mouth, while I ran deeper in.
Geralt|Hmm. So you came here to find a piece of a still. Mean this thing?
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Yes! Where did you find it?
Geralt|Bottom of the pool of a hot spring. Really hid it well, your father.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Your pay. It is not much, I know. But I promise you good prices, the best, once the tavern is open again.
Geralt|Hold you to that.
Geralt|Now let's go. Brothers're probably getting antsy.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Wait, see there? My brothers. They've rounded up some thugs. They mean to attack me!
Geralt|We don't know that…
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Would you try to tell me it's a coincidence that they return with an armed band?
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|They think I've the last part to the still. They would kill me for it!
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Please! You're my only hope. Kill them, elsewise they'll kill me!
Geralt|Kill your brothers? You want that?
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Well… Perhaps not them… But the other roughs, for certain! As to my brothers… I don't know. You couldn't, perhaps, render them harmless…? Argh, will you defend me?
Geralt|Ehh… Don't have much of a choice.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Thanks. A thousand thanks! I shall wait here.
Geralt|Not about to start cutting folk down 'cause of a family squabble about some spare bit of machinery.
Geralt|Which, at any rate, we do not have.
Geralt|We're going over there. And you're gonna settle this, talk it out.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|But should they attack, you will protect me, will you not?
Geralt|If they attack, unprovoked. Let's go.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Hugo! Are you well?
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|We were worried!
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Hrmph. Why do I doubt this?
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Listen, while you were in there, we realized this tiff is… senseless, idiotic. You might have been harmed, gravely, and that's something we could never live down…
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|Lucien is right. We must bury this hatchet, work together as Father wished it.
Geralt|All right. Glad to see you've made up. Now I really need to get back to my own affairs.
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|Naturally. Your payment.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|We thank you for your help! Should you ever find yourself near the Clever Clogs, you must stop in. Superb cognac, some of the best.
Geralt|Will do. So long.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Just a moment. What about the condenser?
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|It's here. We managed to find it while the witcher sought you out.
Geralt|The condenser found, they lived happily ever after. Farewell.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Just a moment. Where's the condenser?
Geralt|Right. Got it here. All yours.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Farewell. And remember to come round.
Geralt|Hm. Claim to come in peace. But then who're these men?
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|Hunters who had made camp nearby. They spotted us and asked if we had no need for their aid.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|You went in, were gone a long time. With these men to help, we thought we might come to your rescue.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|They've come for the last part of the still. They would kill me for it!
Geralt|What about the missing part? Find it?
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|No. I know only that it's in this cave. Likely at the bottom of a pool.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|I feel awkward to ask, but… as I am wounded, would you be kind and retrieve it?
Geralt|Fine. I can do that.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|But you must know I… I cannot pay you well.
Geralt|Figured as much. Start producing cognac, I'll come by for a discount.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|That I promise you!
Geralt|Wait here.
Geralt|Sorry, but none of this is my concern.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|I am here to collect a still component, a vital one. And I shall not leave without it.
Geralt|Listen, you can move in here, for all I care, but the kikimores I killed on my way in are probably not this cave's only tenants.
Geralt|Got two options - you can come with me, or stay and look for your part. Latter involves dealing with any monsters you come across yourself. So what'll it be?
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Ehh, fine. I will go with you. Since I must…
Geralt|Brothers're paying me to drag you out alive, so move.
Geralt|Fascinating, really, but I'm kinda in a hurry.
Geralt|Not a brigand. I'm a witcher. And your brothers sent me to help you.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Oh, no, no no no! I refuse to believe they had a sudden change of heart. They try to kill me, then send help? I sense the stench of treachery a mile off!
Geralt|Found the missing part. Really hid that well, your father.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Oooh, that's fantastic!
Geralt|Warm and damp… Kikimores prefer cooler environments.
Geralt|Probably why they keep their distance.
Geralt|Damn, water's hot. Get burned if I don't watch it.
Geralt|Could use some protection… Maybe Quen'll work?
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Aargh, witcher! What are you doing?
Geralt|Teaching you some decency…
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|He's gone mad! Hold him back!
Toussaint Bandit Weak 01|Get him, gents!
Geralt|Blood trail… Could be Hugo's wounded…
Geralt|Fresh blood on the blade. Weapon was Hugo's maybe?
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|The missing bit - so bleeding important. Please, find it.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|There you are. Why did you not return for me? The missing piece - have you found it?
Geralt|No, I haven't. First, I wanted to--
Geralt|Got it, yeah. Here. Now let's go.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Stand with me, please!
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Rid me of them! They want my death!
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Make no mistake! They're scurvy scoundrels!
<|endoftext|>
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|They got what they deserved.
Geralt|Maybe they did mean well.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|I for one do not believe it. They were overcome with greed, ready to do anything to wrest the last part of the still from me.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|And had they discovered I don't have it, oooh, grim my fate would have been, indeed…
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Besides, you did not kill them. They will come to, soon, having learned a valuable lesson, I trust.
Geralt|So, what now?
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Ah, I fear I don't know. I can't possibly hope to rebuild my father's still… I suppose I must hang a shingle in the market, sell wine…
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Or perhaps I should move on, leave Toussaint? Alas, I know not and will have to see. Whatever the case, I shall not forget your help, with my brothers.
Geralt|Time we went our separate ways. Good luck - whatever you decide to do.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|I thank you, witcher. Fare thee well.
<|endoftext|>
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Ooh, witcher, greetings! What brings you here?
Geralt|Wouldn't mind a drink, some good wine… or cognac.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Be my guest - pick and choose as you will.
Geralt|Decided not to leave after all.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|I had nowhere to go, really, no idea. Apart from which, this is my home.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|True, my brothers and I quarreled, fought tooth and nail, until we acknowledged we'd do best to sell all Father had left us. But I try not to complain.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|I have my stall, little as it may be, and somehow, life flows slowly onward…
Geralt|See you made up with your brothers. Looks like business is good…
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|All true, all true. I cannot complain.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|We'd been rivals all our lives, so at first it was hard to agree - on anything! Yet gradually, we realized we had no other options. Suddenly, it turned out we work well together.
Geralt|Nice to hear.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Hah! And we've you to thank for it! Had we not met you, nothing would have come of our quarrels but heartache. Thank you, witcher.
Geralt|Glad I could help.
Geralt|Time I was on my way. Farewell.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Oh, witcher, greetings! To what do I owe the pleasure?
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Try my cordial. The duchy's best, not a doubt.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Ahh, is this what booming means? Cognac selling like fresh buns on the morn, pleased customers streaming about…
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|Father's desire that we work together - do you see the wisdom of it, now?
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Yes. Papa knew. Papa knew this would work.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Father would be mighty proud.
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|It's fortunate we resolved our differences, made peace. Had Father's cognac recipe gone to waste, I'd not have forgiven any of us. Such a shame.

Toussaint Boy 01|Sir, sir! A letter for you, sir!
Geralt|Letter? Who from?
Toussaint Boy 01|Can't rightly say, sir. I was just to deliver it.
Geralt|See what it says here? "Postage Paid." Won't weasel any coin out of me. Now scram.
Toussaint Boy 01|I knew I should've wiped dirt on that stamp… Bumbotch.
Geralt|"My Dear Friend…"
Yennefer|I've been told you're on a jaunt to Toussaint. I do hope you don't overtax yourself during the Wine Festival. The effects of such exertion at your age can indeed prove most detrimental.
Yennefer|I've come upon some information which might be of interest to you. While browsing through a colleague's book collection, I found mention of one Professor Moreau, of Beauclair, who conducted research into witcher mutations.
Yennefer|The details I've come to learn are rather vague and his laboratory's location remains a mystery. Yet his journal should at least provide hints as to both. It is said he was laid to rest with it in his tomb.
Yennefer|I enclose a map I found in the tome I happened upon. Though less than completely legible, I trust it will prove useful nonetheless.
Yennefer|Should you grow tired of sampling Beauclair's ladies, wines and other exquisite delicacies, this matter might prove a fruitful diversion. Investigate at your leisure. Your friend, Yennefer.
Geralt|Hm. A professor who studied witcher mutations… Might actually be worth looking into.
Geralt|"My Dear Geralt…"
Triss|I hope all is well. I imagine you hot on the trail of some nasty monster - or is it an overly complex curse this time? Oh Geralt, I wish I knew for certain…
Triss|Whatever is keeping you busy, perhaps you'll need a break. For those moments I offer you this intriguing little mystery I happened on in an old manuscript I bought off a merchant from Nazair.
Triss|The tome's author claims a certain Professor Moreau once called Beauclair home. And this professor conducted research into witcher mutations.
Triss|I don't know much else, but I suspect that alone might pique your interest. The tome mentioned a journal interred with the scholar when he passed. It could very well lead you to his laboratory.
Triss|I'm enclosing a map I found folded in the tome. It's smudged in a few places, but I hope it proves useful anyway.
Triss|Please be careful and come back to me quickly. Your Triss.
Geralt|"Dearest,"
Yennefer|I suspect weighty affairs, rather than merely the Wine Festival, have drawn you to Toussaint. Perhaps you'll find time to probe a certain matter in spite of this.
Yennefer|I recently came across the mention of one Professor Moreau, a scholar in Beauclair who conducted research into witcher mutations.
Yennefer|Though the details are rather murky, as is the location of the scholar's laboratory, his journal could contain more information. It lies buried with him in his tomb.
Yennefer|I enclose a map I found in the tome I happened upon. Though less than completely legible, I trust it will prove useful nonetheless.
Yennefer|I felt this matter could prove of some importance to you, thus I dispatched this letter without delay. Whatever you decide, please take exceedingly good care of yourself. Your Yen.
Geralt|Here. And thanks.
Toussaint Boy 01|No, sir, thank you! And I truly hope I'll be of service again!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Hm. Inscription's in Elder Speech… "Salvation lies not in Dol Naev'de, but in our hearts. Glory be to Aelirenn."
Geralt|Professor certainly can't do much to help me with my search…
Geralt|Damn. Professor's journal's long gone. Guess somebody else found out about it, too…
Geralt|Should look around, see if I can find something else…
Geralt|Footprints. Narrow and shallow - somebody small, light. Woman, maybe? Wonder where they lead.
Geralt|Dammit, trail breaks off. Wonder if the grave robber learned more than I did…
Geralt|Also, epitaph mentioned both Aelirenn and Dol Naev'de, Valley of the Nine.
Geralt|Mh, won't learn anything else here. Map Yen sent me'll have to do.
Geralt|Mh, won't learn anything else here. Map Triss sent me'll have to do.
Geralt|Hmm… Site marked on the map's all wet now. Sansretour flows through there. Must be where the Valley of the Nine once lay. Need to explore the location.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Great, portals… This just keeps getting better.
Geralt|Dammit, wrong again… Could be some clue around here…
Geralt|Statues seem oddly oriented, as if to all face in one direction… the right portal, maybe?
Geralt|Grave robber must've found something in Moreau's tomb to activate the entry portal. Wonder what surprises this place has in store…
Geralt|Dammit, traps. Gotta keep an eye out.
Geralt|Giant stone sphere, crushes everything in its path… Subtle.
Gargoyle|Ghaarrr! Unwanted guest! Intruder! You are not welcome here!
Geralt|Yeah, figured as much.
Geralt|Hm. Impressive… This just decoration or…?
Geralt|Hm. Interesting as places go. Seems someone put a lot of thought into its design. Should look around.
Geralt|Gargoyles sure don't look willing to help.
Geralt|Dammit. Back where I started.
Geralt|All right. Now to find the next portal.
Geralt|Implanted spikes. Sick sense of humor, someone's got.
Geralt|Never liked cats.
Geralt|Oh, crap! Didn't I just do this?
Geralt|Course. Locked.
Geralt|Need to find something to open it.
Geralt|Hmm… Notes I found mention four protruding stones. Gotta press them somehow. Crossbow, maybe? Could try to hit them.
Geralt|Hah. Did it.
Geralt|Hm, seems someone besides me might be ferreting around here.
Geralt|Someone slim. No way I can slink through there. Need to find a way around.
Geralt|Blood-soaked… Grave robber was wounded while attempting the climb, needed to bandage up. Managed to avoid the panthers, at least.
Geralt|Whoever was here must've scaled that wall, evaded the panthers.
Geralt|Not bad. Wouldn't mind having something like that myself.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|So… professor tried to neutralize the effects of witcher mutations. Only managed to enhance them, though.
Geralt|Used the albumens of giant centipede eggs as his mutagen base. Need to go on an egg hunt.
Moreau|The eighteenth of Yule, year eleven hundred and two. Today I begin my great life's endeavor, one greater and more significant than any I have thus far undertaken, for it relates to me personally - to myself and my son.
Moreau|When fifteen years past a beast of the forest assaulted me, a witcher came to my aid, saved my life. I could not know that for said salvation I would in the end pay by relinquishing any say as to my own son's fate.
Moreau|Had I the skill to turn back time, I would have done so and perished rather than surrender to the witchers my only son. But as it was, on the day when Jerome was taken, I swore an oath on my honor that I would recover my son.
Moreau|Today, following years of research and preparation, I have at last devised a device that allows me to study mutations. If the gods in their goodness grant me but a bit of favor, I shall find a way to reverse said mutations and restore Jerome to a normal life.
Geralt|So… professor wasn't out to enhance witcher mutations. Wanted to reverse them. Wonder if he managed. And if there's anything in it for me.
Geralt|Crystal with this entry's missing. Might be somewhere. Should look around.
Moreau|Observation twenty-two: Despite applying a surfeit of toxic substances, significantly more than usual, the subject displayed no symptoms of overdosing.
Moreau|I believe this to be an effect of the mutations. Thus, a minor success - this mutation should allow Jerome better to tolerate toxicity.
Moreau|Observation number thirty: The mutations do not set in at once. Curiously, they do not develop over a span of time. Rather, for a mutation to progress towards completion, the appropriate mutagen must be applied continuously.
Moreau|The subject does not bear this well, but I've found a way to make the mutations less taxing, invasive. To the mutagen base, I add the albumen of a mutated giant centipede egg. Stored in a glass terrarium, the eggs do not develop, remain small.
Moreau|The eggs themselves are a sight to behold - mutated, they are luminescent, emitting a wondrous glow. I can only hope my addition of the albumen will produce no significant side effects. Time will tell.
Moreau|Observation fifty-eight: Sometimes failure is the catalyst for success. I've discovered a method by which one type of mutagen may be transmuted into another through the addition of certain ingredients. This is a great day for science!
Moreau|In addition, I observed that today's dose of mutagens brought the subject to the brink of death. He then suddenly awoke, revived, his strength renewed. Not wholly, of course, but he did in a sense come back from the edge of death.
Moreau|Whether this is attributable to his mutations or to pure coincidence cannot be ascertained. I must conduct further experiments.
Moreau|Years of experiments, research, sacrifice - all for naught! I have failed to achieve my defined objective.
Moreau|Each mutation I applied to my subjects proved ineffective when applied to Jerome.
Moreau|What I meant to "cure" him of his witcherism, that which I meant to restore to him a normal life, only deepened his mutations, further augmented his speed and strength, rendered him yet more inhuman.
Moreau|It seems my son must remain a witcher forever. I have failed. The time has come to abandon this place, return home, to Lydia. She may yet deign to take me back.
Moreau|The contraption and mutagens I leave here. Let them wither and crumble - as did my dreams of regaining my son.
Geralt|Hm. So the professor wanted to reverse the mutations' effects. Ended up deepening them… Stroke of luck for me. Could profit from his failure.
Geralt|Seen enough.
Geralt|Just need to pick an entry.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Must be where Moreau had his lab…
Geralt|Guessing this man didn't come here willingly…
Geralt|Quite the library… Mostly tomes on mutations and genetics.
Geralt|Preserved organs… Hope their donors weren't forced to give 'em up.
Geralt|Now to combine all the ingredients…
Geralt|Intriguing as machinery goes… but how do I start it up?
Geralt|A portal, but it's shut tight. Activating crystal's gotta be around here somewhere…
Geralt|Crystal's damaged. Need to replace it with one that'll work.
Geralt|Megascope. Who knows what it'll show me once I activate it. Oughta start up if I hit it with Aard.
Geralt|Empty. Wonder who was kept in here.
Geralt|Moreau must've kept his son in here. Grim.
Geralt|Missing two crystals.
Geralt|Missing one last crystal.
Geralt|All crystals in place. Show me what you got.
Geralt|Hmm. This crystal must go here…
Geralt|Crystals. Should mount them in the megascope.
Geralt|Uh-huh. Mom's awake and she's not in a good mood.
Geralt|Sorry. Need your eggs.
Geralt|Come on…
Geralt|Another one… How many of you in there?
Geralt|Not the right eggs. Moreau mentioned the mutating ones glowing.
Geralt|Mutated. Exactly what I was looking for. Now to get the machine up and running.
Geralt|No point going in wearing full gear. Gotta drop my armor, leave my weapons.
<|endoftext|>
Butler|The servants' quarters. I occupy the green home. With the duchess' permission, I have hired a full staff, their salaries to be paid from the ducal treasury.
Geralt|Nice of her.
Butler|Not the most sightly part of the estate, I admit, but I think it worthwhile for you, as master of the domain, to know where the help stays.
Butler|This served as an additional wine cellar in years of plentiful harvests.
Geralt|Hmm… a bit of work, and it'll make a fine stable for Roach…
Butler|Monsieur Bolius' wife, Nina, kept a garden here… Ahh, a supremely lovely place, it was…
Geralt|Bit neglected, now.
Butler|I agree. Yet nothing stands in the way of restoring it to its former glory and once again planting it with herbs and other vegetation.
Butler|As you can see, the facade is, how to put it, slightly stained… But one cannot deny it a certain subtle, southern charm…
Geralt|True. Though it could use a bit of subtle paint…
Butler|And welcome inside…
Geralt|Nice well. Picturesque.
Butler|Yes, though it ran dry long ago. During the raucous feasts Master Bolius held, he would order it filled with wine.
Butler|There's a tale about a guest, attending a Bolius ball for the first time and thus unaware of the custom. He had suffered great heartbreak and had decided to end his life by jumping into the well.
Butler|The festivities were coming to a close and the well was nearly empty when the suicidal guest finally jumped. Instead of killing himself, he merely broke his legs. To numb the pain, he drank the wine.
Butler|The cellars, voila. During Monsieur Bolius' time, wine was kept here, but Baron Rossell used it to store olive oil as well.
Butler|I took the liberty of cleaning up the, ahem, mess which…
Geralt|I made while fighting the bruxa? Thanks, Barnabas-Basil. Appreciate it.
Butler|Ah, how unfortunate, it seems I wearied you, sir.
Butler|Time has not been kind to Corvo Bianco, but a bit of remodeling should do wonders. If you wish to discuss this further, I shall be in the house.
Butler|Baron Rossell ordered the vines in this part of the estate uprooted and olive groves planted in their place. They look beautiful, especially come spring.
Geralt|Don't look at all bad now, either.
Butler|Down below lies your vineyard.
Butler|Where we grow a strain of Carvanere, one of the world's oldest. Aged in oak barrels, it provides for an exquisite wine with distinct blackberry, wild cherry, plum and cinnamon notes. Marvelous!
Geralt|Have to try it one of these days…
Geralt|Drank himself to death?
Butler|Not at all. When found the next day, he had concluded he'd witnessed twin miracles - the water had been changed into wine, and he had survived. He retired to a monastery in the Dragon Mountains and began preaching the wisdoms of Lebioda.
Butler|Madame Nina planted diminutive, delicate flowers and herbs here. One might say their aroma still hangs in the air…
Geralt|You're quite the romantic, Barnabas-Basil…
Butler|Follow me, please.
Geralt|Been a majordomo all your life?
Butler|Yes, I come from a long line of majordomos. My father was a majordomo, as was my grandfather before him. As was my great aunt. In fact, she was the one to start the tradition.
Geralt|Great aunt?
Butler|A hard woman. It is said that already as a child, she knew where she was going. And went there.
Butler|When she arrived in Beauclair, she signed on as a chambermaid at one of the vineyards, then slowly worked her way up to majordomo.
Butler|She dragged the rest of the family up the same path.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Met your "Ladies" - and I think "Crones" is more fitting as a name for those monstrosities.
Verden Peasant 02|Why d'ya say that?
Geralt|Just the look of them - hideous monsters clad in human robes and skin.
Verden Peasant 02|Fisstech must addle your city folks' brains. I ain't seen all the Ladies, true, but the Whispess, she's shown herself. A true beauty, that 'un.
Geralt|Examined the Whispering Hillock.
Verden Peasant 02|Thought you'd not return… What did ye learn?
Geralt|Your Ladies of the Wood are three murderous sisters.
Verden Peasant 02|Lies! Foul lies! Speak not so 'fore you bring their wrath upon us.
Geralt|Can see we'll never agree on this.
Verden Peasant 02|Now here's what interests me - who caused such hatred towards our guardians to grow in ye, witcher? Why d'ye trust such a one, and not me?
Geralt|You've served those murdering hags faithfully for years. Set out to destroy the forest, clear the hill of trees.
Verden Peasant 02|Aye. I'll not deny it. The Ladies commanded it - but we failed them.
Verden Peasant 02|Egh, if there be a tortured soul beneath that hillock, callin' for justice, we'll answer its cries. But in mine eyes, 'tis not justice it yearns for but blood.
Verden Peasant 02|Don't blabber to me 'bout guilt and punishment. In my reckonin', somethin' wants our lives, but we're not keen on dyin'. And that's all in your hands.
Geralt|The Crones - they've tricked you, they manipulate you.
Verden Peasant 02|Ye been told cruel lies, witcher. I beg ye, don't believe them.
Geralt|You trust women you've never even seen? Why?
Verden Peasant 02|Ere the evil took root on the hillock, the Ladies always helped us. Healthy babes were born. And once a year we got a giant pot of boiled meat.
Geralt|Once a year, that's it?
Verden Peasant 02|At the time of the feast, the Ladies of the Wood give us the scrapings from their table.
Geralt|Others call them the Crones, but you call them the Ladies of the Wood.
Verden Peasant 02|Those who name them Crones, them's heartless fools. The Ladies of the Wood have watched o'er this land for ages.
Geralt|In what way?
Verden Peasant 02|They drive out evil powers. They say a hundred springs ago, they saved Velen from a plague of werewolves ravaging our flocks.
Geralt|Good health to you. Farewell.
Geralt|Greetings.
Verden Peasant 02|Still sniffin' 'round here, are ye?
Verden Peasant 02|You… so, ye still alive? Y-ye sure there's naught wrong with ye?
Geralt|Where is everybody? What happened here?
Verden Peasant 02|Ain't no everybody. Everybody cut everybody else down. Brother lunged at brother, son at father…
Geralt|What… what are you saying?
Verden Peasant 02|A black mare came. Reared up o'er there, by that hut, and… then the madness started. Took ahold o' folk. Mothers carryin' babes suddenly smashed 'em against stumps, and…
Verden Peasant 02|The horror… Me tongue don't wanna say what my eyes've seen… and me mind hopes to forget.
Geralt|So long, ealdorman.
Verden Peasant 02|Ye'd best not come 'round here no more. Whole place ought to sink into the earth.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Third wish - time you stated it.
Olgierd|A moment, Geralt. I must see to somethin', then we'll chat.
Olgierd|You, there! Yank the herrin' out o' the barrel!
Olgierd Bandit 01|Come on, none of this dallyin'.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Ohh….
Olgierd|Now, ready to listen, or do you still not give two shites about what I've got to say?
Novigrad Poor Man 03|I'm ready! I'm listening!
Olgierd|Good. You'll return to your lord and tell him as follows.
Olgierd|His demand was brazen, hurt me to the core. For I was brought up to respect the sacred law of hospitality. And I shall not bend to an uncouth boor's dictum. Understood?
Olgierd|I will pay him a visit shortly to test his willingness to adapt. So you ride off and announce me, and don't spare your horse. Got it?
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Aye… Got it.
Olgierd|Give this man a mount and leave him go!
Olgierd|Come, witcher. We must talk outside.
Geralt|Got something for you.
Olgierd|I love gifts, but I prefer to unwrap them in private.
Olgierd|Oi, lads! Mind the barrels! Goin' out for a jabber with Geralt!
Olgierd|Come.
Geralt|Vlodimir sends his love.
Olgierd|You spoke to him? Impossible.
Geralt|Did more'n that. Fulfilled your wish. And talked to him extensively. Curious what he had to say?
Geralt|Hm. You ever play gwent?
Olgierd|An immortal demands you fulfill three wishes, and you've the gall to propose a round of gwent?
Geralt|Afraid to lose? No problem. I'll find someone else.
Olgierd|Believe that's the worst wind-up I've ever heard. Lay out your cards.
Geralt|So, care for a round of gwent?
Olgierd|Why not.
Geralt|Your band - chosen some interesting specimens.
Olgierd|Interestin'? How so? Common carousers and roughnecks, every last one.
Geralt|Where'd you dig them up?
Olgierd|Some have been with me ages, others I gathered on the road. And a few found me themselves.
Olgierd|They're company for drink and sport, at least. And ever since I began traveling with them, my old enemies have sat quiet as moles.
Geralt|First time I've seen a saber like that. What's its origin?
Olgierd|Ofier. It was a… gift.
Olgierd|Any soft-armed craven can hang a blade from his belt, prance about feignin' danger.
Olgierd|But my saber's a promise - if I reach for it, heads will roll. Mere sight of it quells the urge to duel in shavers eager to face Olgierd von Everec, the infamous outlaw.
Geralt|My medallion seems to think it's magic.
Olgierd|Heh. It thinks, eh? And I think you've never seen a better weapon.
Geralt|Tell me, how'd you meet the Ofieri you turned into a beast?
Olgierd|Aren't you a nosy one.
Geralt|What's it matter? You like to talk about yourself.
Olgierd|That I cannot deny. Ofieri was a dauphin on a voyage through lands unknown to learn of their cultures and customs.
Olgierd|He fell for a lass. As it happened, this woman was already important to me. But at the time I was nowt compared to a noble from a foreign land. So her parents promised her hand to the Ofieri, though she loved me.
Olgierd|If you'd only seen his feeble attempts at charm. When she asked why he traveled disguised as a common merchant, he said he was like the frog from the fairytale - one kiss from her and he'd turn into a prince.
Olgierd|Wanted to be a frog? Became a frog.
Geralt|Keep wondering how you turned the Ofieri into a beast. More I think about it, more I'm sure it was no run-of-the-mill curse.
Olgierd|This professional curiosity, or nosiness as common as the clap?
Geralt|Desire to improve. Information could prove useful down the line.
Olgierd|In the future? You under the delusion you'll complete your tasks, live happily ever after?
Geralt|Remains to be seen. So for now, admit it - a mage helped you, right?
Olgierd|Give you a hint - you're not the only one to fulfill wishes around here.
Geralt|O'Dimm transformed the Ofieri? It was your wish?
Olgierd|Nay, it was my doin' alone. But you're right, it was no ordinary curse, though I'll say no more. A curse I uttered in a moment of rage, with no thought to it actually takin' hold.
Geralt|So long.
Geralt|What're they doing?
Olgierd|Playin'. Overgrown weans, you see…
Olgierd|Have you any children, Geralt?
Geralt|None.
Olgierd|Oh yes. Forgot witchers're sterile. Well, don't just stare at me - tell me what brings you.
Geralt|Need to chat.
Olgierd|I'm all ears, witcher.
Geralt|Empty herring barrel. Stinks of fish. Hm.
Olgierd Bandit 02|What's all this kickin'?
Olgierd Bandit 01|Herrin's gotta turn and mix from time to time!
Olgierd Bandit 02|How much for a herring?
Olgierd Bandit 01|Crown apiece.
Olgierd Bandit 02|Huh. I'll wait for it to drop.
Olgierd|Shite. Not much I detest more than losin'.
Olgierd|Well, my congratulations. This card's yours.
Geralt|Thanks.
Olgierd|If you fulfill wishes as well as you play gwent, I venture I've naught to fear.
Geralt|We'll have to play again.
<|endoftext|>
Coroner|Welcome to chicken test. Tell me what you chosen during part 1.
Coroner|Did you bring Crach children back to him?
Coroner|Did you help Cerys or Hjalmar with "massacre in Kaer Trolde" quest, or did you skip it?
Coroner|What did you do with Keira?
Coroner|What did you do with Sara, the godling in haunted house?
Coroner|Did you help Triss with her mage issues?
Coroner|Is Triss your Girlfriend?
Coroner|Is Yennefer your Girlfriend?
Coroner|Did you kill Whoreson Junior?
Coroner|Did you help Vernon Roche with his Ves problem?
Coroner|Ok, you're done. Good luck.

Philippa Eilhart|Well? What is it?
Geralt|No need to thank me, Philippa. Always glad to save your ass. You're welcome.
Philippa Eilhart|You stood to gain - that is why you saved me.
Geralt|Where's Saskia now? She manage to free herself of your spell?
Philippa Eilhart|I lost control of her when the war broke out. I've no notion where she is.
Geralt|I know you used her, but… couldn't escape the impression that you actually cared for her in some way.
Philippa Eilhart|Really?
Geralt|Way back when, did you really send assassins after Dijkstra?
Philippa Eilhart|You believe I…? Do you not remember we were once lovers?
Geralt|Maybe it's just me, but I think you'd consider that in itself to be reason enough. Actually, I've long wondered why you parted. Quarelled, even.
Philippa Eilhart|Ahh, you see, Geralt, there are those who keep politics separate from their private lives, and those who do not.
Geralt|Which one was Dijkstra?
Philippa Eilhart|The more boring of the two.
Geralt|Farewell.
Philippa Eilhart|What do you want?
<|endoftext|>
Priscilla|Geralt!
Geralt|So, Irina's troupe managing all right?
Priscilla|They continue to stage our play. Benedict Kumbrabone plays the witcher now, but all agree it's just not the same.
Geralt|Listen, I tracked down Whoreson Junior.
Priscilla|Yes? And? Did you learn somethin'?
Geralt|Yeah. Ciri and Dandelion set out to steal Sigi Reuven's treasure for Whoreson. He promised to find someone who'd fix Ciri's phylactery in exchange.
Priscilla|I cannot believe she parleyed with the bastard! Why, it's widely known how anybody who pacts with Wily ends.
Geralt|Ciri was desperate. But you're right, wasn't the best idea. Whoreson ended up wounding Ciri, just after he'd tortured Dudu--
Priscilla|Dudu? Well… Ho-- how is Dudu related to this in any way?
Geralt|Seems Dandelion got him involved, to help Ciri. Luckily, Dudu managed to escape. Probably hiding somewhere now.
Priscilla|Ooh… What of Wily?
Geralt|I'd expect him to lay low, not do any business for some time.
Priscilla|Certainly hope you're right. Though his type never forgives and rarely relents.
Geralt|He's dead.
Geralt|Dandelion - I know where he is.
Priscilla|Where?!
Geralt|Dungeons on Temple Isle.
Priscilla|That's not a nice jest.
Geralt|No jest, sadly. But don't worry, we'll pull him out. Triss has an idea. All we gotta do is find Dudu.
Priscilla|So you must find Dudu in order to find Dandelion with the aim of ultimately finding Ciri? Sounds like an awful lot of searching, but I do wish you luck.
Geralt|Don't have a choice. I gotta meet Whoreson Junior. He might know something.
Geralt|Tell me - you and Dandelion… how'd you meet?
Priscilla|At a poetry tourney in Ellander. Naturally, I'd already heard much about Master Dandelion.
Priscilla|And it proved true - at first I thought him a bloated, narcissistic buffoon.
Geralt|Just at first?
Priscilla|Well, only cows don't change their minds. I changed mine when he came to congratulate me. Never expected he could lose so graciously.
Priscilla|Dandelion can be irritatin', I shan't deny it. Yet, I also know he can be fair and noble at times.
Priscilla|Well… I very much doubt I could bear to have him around were it not so.
Geralt|I see, I get it.
Geralt|Take care now.
Priscilla|Sorry, Geralt. My throat's still quite…
Geralt|Say no more. Get well soon.

Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Password.
Geralt|Dunno any.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|So, out for a little walkie, eh? Counting the emperor's swords to lull you to sleep? Well, in the army we've a place for nosy ramblers  - the scaffold.
Geralt|And thick-skulled quartermasters? They got a place?
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Hehehe… Er, you're clearly skilled at banter. And haggling? You got a knack for that as well?
Geralt|Show me what you're peddling.
Geralt|Morale holding up around here? You boys think you can win this thing?
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Ah, a spy after all. Or one to stir trouble.
Geralt|Neither, just curious.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Riiight. Well, tell anyone who cares we will win this war, because Radovid is mad, as everyone knows, and we've an extraordinarily well-drilled and well-supplied army.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Incidentally, did you wish to buy something?
Geralt|Been a while since I played cards with a subject of His Imperial Majesty. Game of gwent? Let's lay 'em down.
Geralt|So long.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Are you here to spy or haggle?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Show me what you got.
Geralt|Like you to forge something for me.
Geralt|New forge any good?
Dwarf Man 02|Splendid. Nilfgaardians brought a two-chambered bellows from Mahakam, then sent to Vizima for a crack builder. Fellow built a brick hearth and a chimney in no time!
Dwarf Man 02|Only thing is… the local folk don't buy from me no more. They ride to Kozlitz, half a day's road. Even though the duffer there's never forged a decent hoe in his life.
Geralt|But… he's a human. That it?
Geralt|Be careful, Willis. And if the tide turns and Nilfgaard abandons White Orchard, you leave with them. Humans won't forgive you for that boy's death.
Geralt|So long.
Geralt|Greetings. Got anything in stock besides hoes and horseshoes?
Dwarf Man 02|Course I do. Vizima or Mahakam this ain't, but I'm as good a smith as any.
Dwarf Man 02|A return customer! Welcome! What can I do for you this time?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Got any herbs you're willing to sell?
Temerian Woman 01|I'm sure I can find something.
Geralt|Where's Lena? Something happen?
Temerian Woman 01|She passed away. Soon after you'd left.
Geralt|You resent my choice, I understand. But believe me, my potions wouldn't 'ave helped.
Temerian Woman 01|Alas, I must take your word for it.
Temerian Woman 01|She was getting' better. Then Nilfgaardians came, carried her off.
Geralt|Nilfgaardians? Why? What'd they want with her?
Temerian Woman 01|I've no notion. They don't explain what they do. It's not in their custom.
Geralt|Tell me something about yourself. What's your story?
Temerian Woman 01|A sad one. Do you know the Temple of Melitele in Ellander?
Geralt|Do I know it? Can't remember how many times I've been there, how many times Mother Nenneke stitched me up.
Temerian Woman 01|We must've missed each other. I studied to become a healer under Mother Nenneke.
Temerian Woman 01|Hm… I was but eighteen when they took me in. An age at which teachings interest one far less than love.
Temerian Woman 01|There was a boy - Goslav. He'd bare his chest to work. The novices couldn't keep their eyes off him - tripped over their own feet, dropped things. I left the temple for him. We passed a lovely summer together, and then he left.
Temerian Woman 01|Nenneke refused to take me back. My parents uttered not a word, gave me a travel cloak and a small coin pouch. I struggled long to find a place where I'd feel safe, needed. Until I finally arrived here. End of story.
Geralt|Farewell.
Temerian Woman 01|Yes?
<|endoftext|>
Yennefer|Isn't there something you ought to be doing?
Yennefer|Not now. Ciri awaits.
Geralt|See, I thought Ciri could stand to wait a little longer.
Yennefer|It's uninstructive. Not to mention unreasonable.
Geralt|I missed you. A lot.
Yennefer|And I missed you. But we'll have plenty of time to make up for that.
Yennefer|Go and train with her. Then come back. It'll give me a chance to put my face on.
Geralt|Of all the women I've known, you're the only one who does that before…
Yennefer|You've known many?
Geralt|What's it matter? Only ever thought of you…
Geralt|I don't wanna be reasonable.
Yennefer|Aha! So that's the way the wind blows…
Geralt|Ahh, yeah. Better go see Ciri.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Old witcher's fast asleep… Ciri's disappeared somewhere, of course.
Geralt|Guess she prefers practice to theory…
Vesemir|Hm? What?
Geralt|Time to wake up, master.
Geralt|These lessons so boring they put you to sleep, too?
Vesemir|Dammit… Had her taking notes on "Ghouls and Alghouls"… Wanted to rest my eyes a bit.
Geralt|Huh. Making her slog through that brick? No wonder she took off.
Vesemir|John of Brugge lacks flair, true, but he's reliable. Not like the hogwash they print nowadays.
Vesemir|She's tackling the pendulums, right?
Vesemir|How many times do I have to tell her? Don't train alone, it only embeds your errors.
Vesemir|Bring our young damsel to the lower courtyard. She wants to practice? She'll get to practice.
Geralt|Don't get mad at her.
Vesemir|Why the hell not? The whippersnapper refuses to do as she's told.
Geralt|You like that about her.
Vesemir|Hm. Fine, I suppose I'm partly to blame. But this has to end. Now.
Vesemir|Killing monsters is not something to be taken lightly. Ciri must understand that if she's to become one of us.
Vesemir|I'll see you below.
Geralt|Gotta admit we've spoiled her.
Vesemir|"We've" spoiled her? I've been saying it from the start - Ciri needs a firm hand.
Geralt|Been saying that, true. But you let her walk all over you just like the rest of us do.
<|endoftext|>
Eskel|Mh. A month of tracking, stalking, but I finally dropped the son of a bitch.
Geralt|Congratulations. Can't help wondering, though - why'd you keep the corpse? Aim to stuff it, hang it above the mantle?
Eskel|Hm, not a bad idea. Gotta finish the autopsy first, though.
Eskel|This one was quicker than most. Quicker and stronger. Wanna examine it thoroughly.
Geralt|Mind if I have a look?
Eskel|Wanna do the honors?
Geralt|No, thanks. You cut, I'll grab a bite to eat.
Geralt|Let's examine its head.
Eskel|Long whiskers… Protruding frontal lobe, but that's normal. Long ears… and an earring?
Geralt|Mhm. Seen that before. Some of them like shiny objects. Like magpies.
Eskel|And in the maw… yellowed, dulled teeth. Missing its upper front teeth, lower incisors…
Geralt|Clearly not a flosser. Fine, let's move on.
Geralt|Open its gut.
Geralt|So? Anything interesting?
Eskel|Errr, bits of undigested food. A few decades worth, looks like. Human hair, a belt buckle, a few coppers… and a gold ring.
Eskel|Want to give it to Yennefer? Oughta be as good as new once you polish it a bit.
Geralt|No, thanks. She only wears silver.
Eskel|It's her loss. Rest is perfectly normal - except for its gnarled liver. Seems it had a penchant for the blood of drunkards.
Geralt|Nice claws. Fifteen inches, I'd say.
Eskel|They grow its whole life. This one was about a hundred, hundred ten years old.
Geralt|Pretty muscular legs. Calves and feet especially.
Eskel|Lemme tell you, this sucker was fast. One second here, there the next, always in the shadows. Could barely see it.
Geralt|So how'd you take it down?
Eskel|Heh, long story. Tell you another time.
Eskel|Not sure I'd 'ave managed without the alchemist's help.
Geralt|Think I've seen enough for now. This was an old one. Experienced.
Eskel|Hm. It'd be nice to figure out a way to determine a katakan's age based on its tracks. Avoid running across one like this unprepared.
Geralt|It would, I agree. But later.
Geralt|See you, Eskel.
Geralt|Right, leave you to it, then.
Eskel|Hey there, Geralt.
Eskel|Mind if we talk later? Need to clean up before we train.
Eskel|Going to get Ciri?
Geralt|Mhm. Vesemir wants her to practice.
Eskel|I'll join you. Soon as I clear the table.
Geralt|This the katakan you had a contract for?
Geralt|Hm. Impressive specimen.
Eskel|Change your mind? I was just about to start.
<|endoftext|>
Vesemir|Now - parrying. Ciri, see how Geralt holds his sword? Its angle?
Vesemir|Dodge!
Vesemir|Stop showing off, Geralt.
Vesemir|What the blazes are you doing?
Vesemir|Tomfoolery! Enough!
Vesemir|Quick cuts. One, two, three!
Vesemir|Strong strikes, now. Give it all you got!
Vesemir|Riposte. Strike, counter-strike!
Vesemir|Fine, enough. Continue training at will!
Vesemir|Draw your sword, Geralt.
Vesemir|Now, young lady, to bring the day to a close, we'll go over a few witcher's Signs. Let's start with Quen.
Vesemir|Cast Igni, Geralt. I wanna see sparks fly!
Vesemir|Aard, Geralt! Come on!
Vesemir|Slow as a fly trapped in amber today… Do it again.
Vesemir|Good!
Vesemir|Yrden, now. Show her, Geralt.
Vesemir|Time for Axii. Dammit, I hate this feeling…
Vesemir|Throw a bomb. Don't worry, Ciri, Quen'll dampen the blow.
Vesemir|See that, Ciri? Aard will knock anyone or anything off balance, destroy their rhythm.
Vesemir|See? If not for the Quen Sign, I'd be aflame by now.
Vesemir|Ciri, Quen is sometimes called the "witcher's shield." Now watch carefully to see why.
Vesemir|See this, Ciri? Couldn't move if I wanted to.
Vesemir|Ugh… Axii can really muddle your mind.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Wrong.
Geralt|Now I see why you were so eager to practice. Strike!
Cirilla Young|Ha!
Geralt|You're not in the circus. Pirouette!
Geralt|Wrong. Footwork!
Geralt|Enough. Get down.
Cirilla Young|With a flip?
Geralt|What do you think?
Geralt|All right, take off the blindfold.
Geralt|You've got work to do. Your reflexes are still slow.
Cirilla Young|Maybe for a witcher.
Geralt|Think drowners or strigas will go easy on you because you haven't undergone the mutations?
Geralt|Though in your shoes I'd fear Vesemir more than any striga. Disobeying his instructions… Unwise.
Cirilla Young|Well, yes, but… that book was horribly dull!
Geralt|I know. And you know that's no excuse.
Cirilla Young|Ugh. I'm sorry. It won't happen again.
Geralt|Sorry's not good enough.
Geralt|You're gonna read "Ghouls and Alghouls" in its entirety. Appendices included.
Cirilla Young|No, please… I'd rather clean the stables!
Geralt|End of discussion.
Geralt|Come on. We'll practice with the others down below.
Cirilla Young|Shall we run the walls?
Geralt|Of course. This a witcher school or an elven bathhouse?
Geralt|Not this time. Believe me, you don't want to keep Vesemir waiting.
Geralt|Better not. Vesemir said if it does, he'll make you eat a bowl of slugs. Covered in salt.
Cirilla Young|Hahaha. Eeewwwww!
Geralt|Exactly. So you'd best behave.
<|endoftext|>
Vesemir|Anything to say for yourself, young lady?
Cirilla Young|I'm very sorry, Uncle Vesemir.
Vesemir|Young blood craves action, I understand that. But when you fight a beast, knowledge counts as much as your silver sword. At the very least, you ought to be able to tell a ghoul from an alghoul…
Cirilla Young|…"by markings, like unto the panthera tigris that in Zerrikania dwells, and by the sickly paleness of its visage."
Vesemir|Hmm. So you did read the chapter. Still, you should've asked if…
Cirilla Young|But you were asleep, Uncle Vesemir.
Geralt|Don't try to weasel your way out of this.
Cirilla Young|"A witcher must know how to trick his opponent." You said so yourself.
Geralt|Might've. But don't use my words of wisdom on Vesemir, got it? That's playing with fire.
Vesemir|Fine, we've talked enough. Geralt, you're with me. Lambert with Eskel. Ciri with the dummy.
Cirilla Young|Huh… Again?
Vesemir|Stop groaning and grab a sword!
Vesemir|What do you think - should we start by reviewing the fundamentals, or go right to free training?
Geralt|Should work on the basics. Even skilled masters need to hone the fundamentals… and Ciri's barely a novice.
Geralt|Let's skip straight to free training. No point going over the basics again.
Geralt|So you did the reading. Why not admit it right off?
Cirilla Young|"Never pounce on an advantage as soon as it appears. Wait till it stands to have maximum effect." Uncle Vesemir's words.
Vesemir|Well, you're a quick study. Quick, but mischievous.
<|endoftext|>
Cirilla Young|Beat you to the bottom!
Geralt|Hah. Maybe if you fall.
Geralt|What did I tell you about breathing? Through your mouth, in rhythm with your steps.
Cirilla Young|Huhhhh… Huhhhh… Huhhh…
Geralt|Ciri. Cut it out.
Cirilla Young|Oh no… Vesemir's got that look.
Geralt|What'd you expect?
Cirilla Young|Don't bother me, Geralt! I'll trip and fall!
Cirilla Young|Geralt, what is it? Come on!
Cirilla Young|Hey! You said we weren't allowed to do that!
Geralt|I said you weren't allowed to do it.
Cirilla Young|Run into trouble? Should I turn back and help you?!
Cirilla Young|First! Hehe. Na-na-na-na-naaa!
Geralt|I win.
Cirilla Young|Your legs are longer! I'll show you yet - just need to grow a bit!
<|endoftext|>
Vesemir|You all right?
Geralt|Mhm. Had a nightmare…
Vesemir|About?
Geralt|Take forever to explain.
Vesemir|Dawn's some way off. We've got time.
Geralt|Started in the guest room at Kaer Morhen. I was relaxing in the tub, and next to me…
Vesemir|Triss?
Geralt|Yennefer. Funny, isn't it? She's never been there. Seemed so real in my dream, though.
Vesemir|Was she nagging you about something?
Geralt|Hm. Mhm.
Vesemir|True to life, indeed.
Vesemir|We'll find her.
Geralt|In the dream, I went and found Ciri. Then we trained.
Vesemir|Those were the days… Hm, little she-devil.
Vesemir|I've trained kids who were faster, stronger - but none had her character.
Vesemir|Didn't end well, did it? Your dream.
Geralt|No. The Wild Hunt appeared, attacked Ciri… I couldn't move. Stood there like a stump.
Vesemir|It was just a dream.
Geralt|Be dawning soon. Time to go.
Vesemir|Wait. Show me the letter from Yennefer, might've overlooked some hint in there.
Geralt|Didn't overlook anything. We were meant to meet in Willoughby - that's what she wrote. Meanwhile one army or another burned the village to the ground. All we can do is follow her trail, so…
Vesemir|Stop talking for a minute and give me the letter. Well, how about that! It does smell of lilac and gooseberries.
Geralt|You were gonna read it, not sniff it.
Vesemir|"We must meet. Soon"… "Willoughby, near Vizima"… Hm, nothing else to guide us there.
Vesemir|What's this postscript? "I still have the unicorn?"
Geralt|That's private. Very private.
Vesemir|A-ha… I understand. Least I think I do. Maybe not entirely, but… perhaps that's for the best.
Geralt|Back on topic. How's it look - how far behind Yennefer are we?
Vesemir|Two, three days… Trail's fresh. But it looks like it leads towards the main road. Could be muddled there.
Vesemir|Wait - hear that?
Geralt|I hear it, I smell it. Ghouls.
Geralt|Stuffed unicorn. Used it once or twice. In certain… situations.
Vesemir|Hm! The things young folk get up to these days…
Geralt|That's the problem - it was more.
Geralt|In the past, when Ciri'd appear in my dreams, something was wrong. She was in danger.
Vesemir|We taught her how to defend herself from anything, wraiths included.
Geralt|I know we will. That's not what worries me.
Geralt|You've seen her tracks. She's at full gallop all the time, breakneck speed through wild lands, devastated battlefields… She's in a hurry to get somewhere, or fleeing something. Either way, it means trouble of some sort.
Vesemir|Be surprised if she wasn't in trouble.
Vesemir|She's always poked her nose in beehives. Courtly intrigues here, mages' conspiracies there. What do you expect?
Geralt|Don't know… Guess I thought, once we were finally reunited, things would be calm. At least for a while.
Vesemir|Calm? With Yennefer? Hmph. Good luck.
Geralt|Rather not talk about it.
Vesemir|Gotcha.
Geralt|So… time to hit the road?
<|endoftext|>
Vesemir|War's not exactly going our way.
Geralt|We have a side?
Vesemir|The Northern Realms.
Geralt|Radovid's Realms, don't you mean? Temeria and Aedirn are no more.
Vesemir|Radovid's pledged to restore the old borders - soon as he wins the war.
Geralt|Believe that?
Vesemir|Hmph. Gotta believe something. It's what keeps us going.
Geralt|Ever tell you about this sorcerer I knew? Couldn't stop talking about how useful they are as creatures.
Vesemir|Because you can brew potions from their blood?
Geralt|Heh, no. Because by eating rotting corpses they prevent epidemics.
Vesemir|Hmph. Did he know they eat the living as well?
Geralt|No. Really upset him, too… His theory collapsed.
Geralt|So… a griffin this close to the village? Strange.
Vesemir|My thoughts exactly. In a forest or the mountains, sure, but here? And near the main road?
Geralt|Maybe it's the war. Corpses everywhere, the stench of blood, burnt flesh… Drives monsters crazy sometimes.
Vesemir|Men, too.
Vesemir|We need to watch ourselves in White Orchard. And we should leave as soon as we learn anything.
Vesemir|Of course. When armies pass, necrophages follow. Let's go before any more show up.
Vesemir|Geralt, dammit! I'm too old to chase you!
Vesemir|Whoa, Wolf, where do you think you're going? Come back!
Vesemir|You lost a marble? Turn around!
<|endoftext|>
Vesemir|We going?
Temerian Merchant 01|Help me! Help!
Temerian Merchant 01|Ha-has it gone?
Geralt|Yeah. Come out!
Temerian Merchant 01|Gods, that was close! I was sure I'd end up like my mare.
Vesemir|Provided you got lucky.
Geralt|Your horse died quickly. But griffins like to toy with their prey. Eat it, alive, piece by piece.
Temerian Merchant 01|Ahh-ha.
Temerian Merchant 01|You'd… you'd like a reward, I suppose?
Geralt|You don't owe us anything. You were in need, we helped.
Temerian Merchant 01|And they call witchers heartless. Say they won't lift a finger without pay.
Geralt|They also say mice are born of rotting straw.
Geralt|Back to the trail?
Vesemir|Like I said - leads to the main road and ends there. Muddled.
Temerian Merchant 01|You seek someone?
Geralt|Yes, a woman, medium height, long, black hair. Seen anyone like that?
Temerian Merchant 01|No. But…
Temerian Merchant 01|There's an inn here in White Orchard. Sole one around. Gets its share of travelers, perhaps you'll learn something there.
Geralt|Not a bad idea. Especially since that wound needs cleaning.
Vesemir|Bah, beast barely grazed me. But sure… Could use a good rye. Nice and cool, you know, straight from a cellar?
Geralt|Let's go.
Temerian Merchant 01|Besides, the innkeep's my cousin. Tell her Bram sent you, she'll treat you like family.
Geralt|What's it to you?
Temerian Merchant 01|Well, you see…
Geralt|Could always use a few crowns.
Temerian Merchant 01|Thing is, I've a meager purse at the moment. Nilfgaardians requisitioned my goods, now this…
Temerian Merchant 01|Here.
<|endoftext|>
Inkeeper Elza|What?
Temerian Bandit 01|Take that down before there's trouble.
Novigrad Old Man 01|That is a coat of arms - the Temerian Lilies! They've a right to hang there!
Temerian Bandit 01|This ain't Temeria no more, old man. It's Nilfgaard now.
Novigrad Old Man 01|My arse, it is!
Temerian Bandit 02|Wha? Witchers…?
Temerian Bandit 01|I'll not drink with weevil-arsed freaks.
Inkeeper Elza|Beg your pardon for those thugs.
Vesemir|No need. We're used to it.
Inkeeper Elza|Folk're jumpy 'round here. Armies just passed through, now a griffin's prowlin' about…
Geralt|Mhm. Already had the pleasure.
Geralt|One mean beast.
Inkeeper Elza|Mean? Light way for a hunter to put it! Clawed Lena so bad, poor thing's one foot in the grave…
Inkeeper Elza|But, does no good to wallow in misfortune. How can I be of service?
Vesemir|With a drop of vodka for me.
Inkeeper Elza|And you? Something to wet your tongue?
Geralt|Show me what you got behind the counter.
Geralt|Looking for a woman. Raven-haired, violet eyes. Dresses in black and white. Riding in from Willoughby.
Geralt|And, uh, strange as it sounds - lilac and gooseberries, might've smelled that.
Inkeeper Elza|I've not seen nor smelt such a lady. Believe I'd remember.
Vesemir|Yeah. Especially hard to forget this one.
Inkeeper Elza|Plenty of travelers about, though, folk from all over. Might be worth your while to ask after her.
Geralt|Pretty busy place you got.
Inkeeper Elza|Nation's on the move. Some search for kin, others just want to get out of the way of the armies. They all need food, drink, and a night's rest in warmth.
Geralt|So, war's been good for your trade?
Inkeeper Elza|Aye, so far. But it'd be best to know peace again. Times like these you never know what tomorrow will bring.
Geralt|There a contract on that griffin?
Inkeeper Elza|Nay, not at the moment.
Inkeeper Elza|Used to be, soon as a beast'd built a nest nearby the ealdorman'd start a collection, or go to the lord for help.
Inkeeper Elza|Now the ealdorman don't use the privy without askin' the Black Ones' permission first. And seems they hanged the lord… So, no contract.
Vesemir|Shame. We might have done something, but not for free.
Geralt|Thanks. For everything.
Inkeeper Elza|Master witchers, would you be of a mind to kill the griffin? Beast's a scourge on our land.
Inkeeper Elza|Only killed livestock at first, but it's got a taste for human flesh of late. We're afeared to set foot outdoors.
Geralt|If someone'll pay us, won't say no.
Geralt|Help you bandage that up?
Vesemir|Please. I'm not decrepit yet.
Geralt|Then I'll ask about Yennefer.
Vesemir|Mhm. Just remember - we'd rather not draw any attention.
Geralt|Ran into your kinsman, Bram.
Inkeeper Elza|Bram? How is he?
Vesemir|Alive. Sends his regards.
Inkeeper Elza|Master witchers… food and drink on the house. What can I get you?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|I'm looking for someone.
Temerian Peasant 01|And we seek some peace and quiet.
Temerian Peasant 02|Outta my face, freak, 'fore your breath sours my beer.
Geralt|Just wanna talk.
Temerian Peasant 02|Ye deaf, stray? No one here'll talk to ye.
Temerian Peasant 01|If it's company you seek, stick that mangy snout of yours in a trough with the pigs.
Temerian Peasant 02|Heheheh! Showed that shiteater, Mikah!
Geralt|Running low on patience. Once it's gone, your heads'll roll.
Temerian Peasant 01|Oh, we was jestin', no call for anger…
Geralt|See a raven-haired woman here? Dressed in black and white?
Temerian Peasant 02|We know nothing, sir. Leave us be.
Geralt|Raven-haired woman dressed in black and white. Seen her? Talk.
Temerian Peasant 01|Folk say the lady rode through the village a few days back. Gallopin' so fast she knocked Radobor into a ditch.
Geralt|Which way did she go?
Temerian Peasant 01|Dunno… Lots of tracks leadin' off the main road. Coulda gone anywhere.
Temerian Peasant 02|Oi, people! The freak's taken Mikah's mind!
Geralt|Uh-huh. And I'll take your tongue if you don't shut up.
Geralt|Waste of words. Don't have time for your kind.
Temerian Peasant 01|Smart. Nor do we have time for yours.
Temerian Peasant 01|Look, he's back.
Temerian Peasant 02|Why d'ye keep pesterin' us, eh? Do better to kill the griffin!
Temerian Peasant 01|You hear? Black Ones been out measurin' the fields.
Temerian Peasant 02|Let 'em measure, better that than burnin' the harvest.
Temerian Peasant 01|Argh, Dromle. Dromle, you're dumber than a headless cockerel.
Temerian Peasant 01|Why they markin' out them lines, eh? To parcel out their patrimony, give it to their own!
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Nobleman 01|What a waste of time. The earth shall revolve around the sun before you comprehend these rules.
Geralt|Got a minute?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Why not. Aldert Geert, assistant professor in contemporary history at Oxenfurt Academy.
Geralt|Geralt of Rivia. Witcher with tenure.
Geralt|I'm looking for a woman - long hair, dressed in black and white. Seen anyone like that?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Of course not. Unlike the populace, I know the Horsewoman of War is pure poppycock.
Geralt|Horsewoman of War - what's that about?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Folk say an omen, a beautiful phantom rides the fields at night. Looks as you described her. Armies follow her, and all who cross her path meet with misfortune.
Geralt|I can vouch for the last bit. Know where they saw her?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|No. Facts interest me, not fairytales.
Geralt|Let's play this game of yours.
Geralt|Explain the rules first, though.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|With pleasure! They're as simple as falling off a log.
Geralt|Not a place I'd ever expect to find a scholar. Take it you're fleeing the war?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Quite the opposite. Chasing it. I'm headed for the front.
Geralt|Tired of life?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|I seek knowledge, which I value more than life itself. I've a thirst no dusty old tomes can quench.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|I wish to see the Nilfgaardian invasion with my own eyes, understand it, and record it all in my chronicle, my magnum opus.
Geralt|Take my advice - go back to your books while you can. War's no game.
Geralt|No faculty meetings to attend, no tenure to gain, endnotes to compile. First soldier you see'll kill you.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Why would he do that? Me, a neutral civilian, a scholar…
Geralt|Boots.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Come again?
Geralt|He'll kill you for your boots.
Geralt|Interesting. We need somebody to describe war - what it's really like. Not colorful banners and generals making moving speeches, but rape, violence, and thoughtless cruelty.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Ah, I see you lack the polish of the academy.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Rape and cruelty are details of no import to the war's course. Trinkets on the garment of conflict, one might say.
Geralt|Hm. Tell that to the people whose houses burned down.
Geralt|War reached Novigrad yet?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|No, but it's only a matter of time. Nilfgaard on one bank, Redania on the other… Drooling over the city like dogs over a juicy bone.
Geralt|Many a ruler's choked on that bone.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|True. We value our liberty in Novigrad and we know how to fight for it.
Geralt|Mhm. The scholars especially.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|The sword is not the only weapon. Do not forget, architects from our academy designed the city walls - walls no war machine has ever crumbled!
Geralt|Gotta go. So long.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|A moment, witcher. You strike me as a man of the world. Are you familiar with gwent?
Geralt|No. And I don't have time to learn.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|But the rules are quite simple. Come, let's play.
Geralt|Hmm… Why not.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Splendid! Here's how it's done.
Geralt|No thanks. Got some other things on my mind.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Shame. I'd ask the locals, but since they can't count to ten, the rules are a complete mystery.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Ah well, I'm here if you change your mind.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Till next time!
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Ah, you return! Shall I deal?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Once more. There are four factions--
Temerian Peasant 02|Four what?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Factions, teams, suits! Similar to clubs and spades, except each suit has its own face cards. There are also special cards…
Temerian Peasant 02|Wouldn't you rather play war? It's like to be near dawn 'fore you get your game in me noggin.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Hmm, well… It's not a game for everyone. Requires an analytical mind.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|If you ever find yourself in Oxenfurt and wish to play a true master, ask for Stjepan. A simple innkeep by trade, but a true maestro when it comes to gwent.
Geralt|I'll remember that. Thanks.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Well, well. You've a knack for this game.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|An interesting round. If you desire a rematch, let me know.

Geralt|Looking for a woman.
Mirror|Ahh, like everyone.
Geralt|Not like everyone, and not just any woman. Mine smells of lilac and gooseberries, dresses in black and white.
Mirror|Two schnappses!
Mirror|Hah. It'll lift your spirits.
Geralt|Fine, I'll have a drink.
Geralt|Can we cut to the chase? You seen her or not?
Mirror|Yennefer of Vengerberg?
Geralt|Never mentioned her name.
Mirror|Yet you described her perfectly. And once I hear something, I never forget. Can't help it.
Geralt|You seen Yennefer?
Mirror|Deepest apologies, but I must ask: Is this about love?
Geralt|None of your business.
Mirror|Yes, as a vagrant I deserve no explanation.
Geralt|What do you know? Tell me.
Mirror|Before you appeared, it never occurred to me that might've been Yennefer. Who would've have thought…
Geralt|Get to the point.
Mirror|A Nilfgaardian scout from the local garrison saw her.
Geralt|Where?
Mirror|At their camp. She rode in there - dark of night, black and white, gooseberries and… yes, I know. Had a terse exchange with the garrison commander and raced off.
Geralt|Where to?
Mirror|I'm not omniscient. Ask at the garrison.
Geralt|Thanks.
Mirror|We men of the road must stick together. Perhaps one day I'll be in trouble and you'll be nearby to help.
Geralt|Guessed it. It's love.
Mirror|I knew it at once.
Geralt|Recognize me from Master Dandelion's ballads, too?
Mirror|To your health.
Geralt|How do you know Yennefer?
Mirror|What a question. Master Dandelion's ballads, of course. The only way a humble merchant might hope to rub up against greatness. Unless, that is, he's as lucky as I am.
Geralt|And runs into a very patient witcher?
Mirror|Into Geralt of Rivia himself. The Butcher of Blaviken.
Geralt|What do you do? Who are you?
Mirror|A mangy vagrant. Gaunter O'Dimm, at your service.
Geralt|Vagrant - that a profession now?
Mirror|Ah, once a merchant of mirrors. The madding crowd dubbed me Master Mirror, or the Man of Glass.
Geralt|Don't generally drink with strangers.
Mirror|Come. I know this to be a vile place. You might down a little glass merely to aid digestion.
Geralt|Finding her - that'll lift my spirits.
Mirror|You look haggard. It's just a few drops to improve your mood. A little schnappsie's never hurt a soul.
Geralt|Yennefer's in danger.
Mirror|Oh, the devilry! Why didn't you say so?! We must act.
<|endoftext|>
Temerian Bandit 01|Done drinkin'?
Geralt|Mhm.
Temerian Bandit 01|Then fuck off.
Temerian Bandit 02|Hrrk-ptoo. Don't want your kind here.
Geralt|Better round up someone else to help. Three of you don't stand a chance against me.
Temerian Bandit 01|Wha?! I could fuck you up by meself.
Geralt|If I had a bag over my head and my hands tied behind-- Actually, no, not even then.
Temerian Bandit 02|Chet, Lesh, back off. I'll teach this vagrant a lesson, man on freak.
Geralt|Wouldn't want to stay long, anyway.
Temerian Bandit 01|Maybe not. And maybe you'll just stay forever.
Temerian Bandit 02|Six feet under.
Geralt|Haven't done anything to you. So just calm down.
Temerian Bandit 01|Course not… nay, uh… ye done nothin'…
Temerian Bandit 02|Whoreson's workin' witchcraft! Get him!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Huh, you Black Ones aren't so scary after all. Can even be nice if you want to.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|Don't get accustomed, Nordling.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 03|To the tower. Go.
Geralt|Guessing your captain's got work for me.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|This is the army, Nordling. There is no guessing.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|Military camp. No locals allowed without the express consent of the garrison commander.
Geralt|I look like a local to you?
Nilfgaardian Soldier 03|You look like trouble.
Geralt|Dead wrong - I make trouble go away. I'm a witcher.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|A witcher…?
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|Captain Peter Saar Gwynleve is in the tower. Turn right, past the gate.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Tomira and Mislav… Thanks.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|{Ess soond jakkten. } [Good hunting to you.]
Geralt|Need to ask you about something.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Yes? What?
Geralt|I'll need bait, a specific herb - buckthorn. Scent should lure the griffin from ten miles off.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Buck… buckthorn? I do not know this. But I am not yet fluent in the Common tongue.
Geralt|Mhm. Probably mastered the basics, though - "hands up," "kill them"…
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|No. First came idioms. "Don't play with fire," for example.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Go to Tomira, an herbalist. She lives near the crossroads. She will aid you.
Geralt|Need more information about this griffin. Its sex, why it's abandoned its lair.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Shall I bring you witnesses?
Geralt|They won't say anything I don't already know. I need to go where your men died, look around. What's the name of the hunter who found them?
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Mislav. He has a hut south of the village, very near the wood. Helpful fellow. A little strange, though.
Geralt|So long.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|How much grain will your village give?
Temerian Peasant 01|Whatever you say, Your Excellency.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Look at my hands. Look! See the calluses?
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|These are not the hands of an "Excellency," but of a farmer. So we speak peasant to peasant. How much can you give?
Temerian Peasant 01|Forty bushels. There'd be more, sir, but our lads, the Temerians, that is, took from us earlier and…
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|You will give thirty, and that will do. Let us settle on it. And I wish to see the transport soon.
Temerian Peasant 01|Ah, thank you, sir! Thank you kindly!
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|I summoned only the ealdorman and the smith, Willis - but it is said he is a dwarf. You are too tall to be him.
Geralt|Very perceptive of you.
Geralt|Geralt of Rivia. Witcher.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|A vatt'ghern - this explains why I did not hear your footsteps. What do you seek here?
Geralt|Yennefer of Vengerberg. Where was she headed?
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|That is a military secret.
Geralt|Haven't thrown me out yet. Haven't called the guards. So go ahead - what's your price?
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|There is a griffin in the area. Slay it, and then I shall see what I can do.
Geralt|It's a deal. Some questions before I start. Know where the griffin has its lair?
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|It kept to the Vulpine Woods at first. I sent a patrol there, five young men. A hunter found them two days on. I only recognized them because they wore our plate.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Since then, the griffin has grown bold. Attacks in villages, fields, on the main road.
Geralt|Meaning it's abandoned its lair. Gonna have to set a trap.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|I judge from your tone this will not be easy. What do you require?
Geralt|Why do you care about this griffin?
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Because I care about people.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|The beast has killed ten already. Including a few of my men.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|To hunt it, I would need to mobilize the entire garrison, comb the woods, organize a battue. Simply impossible.
Geralt|Too big a hassle?
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|No. Too high a risk.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|I cannot disperse my forces. Temeria's army we have crushed, but its common folk remain, ready to answer a call to arms. So as to this griffin, I can sit on my hands… or hire a professional.
Geralt|Plan to requisition something from him, too?
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|If it is necessary - yes, of course. We are at war, in case you have not noticed.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Who are you? Speak.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Got good news and bad news.
Geralt|Good news first - captain of the Nilfgaardian garrison knows where Yennefer went.
Vesemir|And the bad's that we have to kill the griffin for him.
Vesemir|What else could he want from two witchers? Go on, tell me what you know.
Geralt|Griffin's abandoned its lair. Gotta make a lure, set a trap.
Vesemir|Need help?
Geralt|Running through the fields, picking herbs? Thanks, think I'll manage.
Vesemir|And how's that going?
Geralt|I'm ready. No point in waiting. Let's find a good spot to ambush it.
Vesemir|Picked one out already. Other side of the stream - there's fields and a grove. Plenty of room and far enough so no one'll get in our way.
Geralt|Good. Meet you there.
Geralt|Learned some things. It's a male, had its nest in the Vulpine Woods.
Geralt|The Nilfgaardians burned the woods down, killed its mate, smashed their eggs - thought they'd fixed things.
Vesemir|Hm. It's always the same. Instead of sending for a professional, they try to do it themselves, only end up making matters worse.
Vesemir|But enough about that. Find some buckthorn and we'll finish what they started.
Vesemir|Hm-hm. Fine, if everything's ready, say the word and we'll get to work.
Geralt|Got the buckthorn.
Vesemir|Oughta work like a charm. Powerful scent.
Geralt|More like stench.
Vesemir|City boy. Rotting meat, manure, piss - standard smells of the countryside.
Vesemir|Remember Tretogor, hunting that zeugl in the trash heap? You spent half the next day bathing, scrubbing yourself.
Geralt|How can I forget? You ever gonna stop bringing that up?
Vesemir|All right, about the griffin - learn what you can. We gotta make a lure that'll work. Soon as we do, we can start.
Geralt|Later, Vesemir.
Geralt|Been busy with the griffin contract.
Vesemir|And?
Geralt|Wanted to let you know it'll be a bit longer.
Vesemir|Fine. I'll wait.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Bad time?
Temerian Woman 01|Not at all. Hand me the beggartick. It's the…
Temerian Woman 01|…red bloom. Well, well, one versed in herbs.
Geralt|Probably saying too much… but I know a bit - for instance, that beggartick's poisonous.
Temerian Woman 01|In large doses. Small ones soothe pain and bring forth pleasant dreams.
Temerian Woman 01|Which is all I can hope to do for her.
Geralt|Looking for buckthorn. Know if it grows anywhere around here?
Temerian Woman 01|Mhm. Bottom of the river, where the channel's widest. But you do know that once out of the water…
Geralt|…it'll stink worse than a week-old carcass? Counting on it.
Geralt|I'm hunting the griffin. Need the buckthorn for bait.
Temerian Woman 01|I was thinkin'… A few years ago we had trouble, drowners under the bridge. Whole village had to pitch in for a witcher.
Temerian Woman 01|Who now can afford the bounty on a griffin's head?
Geralt|Captain Peter Saar… something something.
Temerian Woman 01|Ah. Good to know the Black Ones are lookin' out for our welfare.
Geralt|Doubt Emperor Emhyr cares about you, but this captain just might. Seems like a decent man.
Temerian Woman 01|There are no decent men in the army. There're only orders.
Geralt|Not from here, are you?
Geralt|Lot of bitterness in you. Too much for someone who's spent her life in a hut in the middle of nowhere.
Temerian Woman 01|True.
Temerian Woman 01|And you're in a hurry. Elsewise you'd not use bait, just wait for the griffin to attack again.
Geralt|Believe we could have an interesting conversation.
Temerian Woman 01|Maybe next time.
Geralt|Nilfgaard values one thing - order. Griffin's disturbing that, it's gotta go.
Temerian Woman 01|Yes. First they'll tend to the monsters, then to the folk.
Temerian Woman 01|Oh yes, the griffin. Might've guessed.
Geralt|Griffin do that to her?
Temerian Woman 01|To Lena? Yes. Attacked her at night. She was walkin' in the woods.
Geralt|At night… through the woods? In wartime?
Temerian Woman 01|Meeting a boy. The young, you know… do foolish things for love.
Temerian Woman 01|Wounds are healing, but she will die. Blood's poolin' in her skull. Nothing my brews can do to help.
Geralt|I've agreed to kill the griffin. No more victims after I do.
Temerian Woman 01|Ugh, there will be, of course. With the griffin gone, others will kill in its stead. Monsters, or men.
Geralt|So what do you think I should do?
Temerian Woman 01|Ply your trade. But don't think you can change anything.
Geralt|Could try to help her with one of my potions. Swallow can heal internal hemorrhages…
Temerian Woman 01|But?
Geralt|Witchers' potions aren't for humans.
Temerian Woman 01|She'll die as it is.
Geralt|Yes. A peaceful death, soothed by your concoctions. If I give her Swallow and something goes wrong, the whole village will hear her screams.
Temerian Woman 01|I understand. Do as you will.
Geralt|Got a potion for Lena. Swallow.
Temerian Woman 01|First sign of spring, symbol of rebirth… Fitting, as names go.
Geralt|We'll see. Like I said, could harm her. Deeply.
Geralt|Works on me immediately, but I have a faster metabolism. Effects won't appear in her case for a few days.
Temerian Woman 01|Why'd you choose this in the end?
Geralt|Decided it was better than doing nothing.
Temerian Woman 01|I like you, witcher. Here - a small gift. For giving a damn.
<|endoftext|>
Temerian Peasant 03|Dieter…
Geralt|You know him?
Temerian Peasant 03|We served at the lord's manor together, where the black army's encamped now. He was a stable hand, I was the lord's hunter.
Temerian Peasant 03|But that was before… Well, a long time ago.
Geralt|Sorry. Hope you weren't close.
Temerian Peasant 03|No. Not at all.
Geralt|So… can you show me where you found the Nilfgaardians?
Geralt|Before what?
Temerian Peasant 03|Before they drove me from the village.
Geralt|What'd you do?
Temerian Peasant 03|Nothin'. I'm a freak.
Temerian Peasant 03|Sorry, I'd rather not talk about it.
Geralt|Don't have to, then.
Geralt|I'm a freak, too.
Temerian Peasant 03|Aye, but of another kind.
Geralt|If it's lycanthropy, I can help.
Temerian Peasant 03|What?
Geralt|Lycanthropy. Werewolves? Handled a few cases in the past. It's usually a simple curse that…
Temerian Peasant 03|The lord's son, Florian, and I… We loved each other.
Temerian Peasant 03|Dieter walked in on us in the stables. They drove me away… Florian hanged himself. Lord started drinkin', and the estate fell into ruin. That's the long and short of it.
Geralt|I'm sorry.
Temerian Peasant 03|Ah, ancient history now.
Temerian Peasant 03|I was to show you where I found the Nilfgaardians. Come.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|You Mislav?
Temerian Peasant 03|Shhh.
Temerian Peasant 03|Hear that?
Geralt|Wolves? No - wild dogs.
Temerian Peasant 03|Yes... more dangerous than wolves.
Geralt|I'm hunting bigger game. The Nilfgaardians the griffin killed - where'd you find them?
Temerian Peasant 03|Ah, I see… You a witcher? That monster slayer they's talkin' about in the village?
Geralt|Mhm.
Temerian Peasant 03|I'll show you, sure. But, er, I gotta kill those mutts 'fore they hurt someone.
Temerian Peasant 03|Will you help? That is, if you don't mind bluntin' your silver blades on 'em.
Geralt|Sure. Griffin's not going anywhere.
Temerian Peasant 03|No, dogs might, though. So step careful, now. Come on.
Geralt|Blades don't worry me. Time does. I'm in a hurry.
Temerian Peasant 03|Can't fault you for it. Come on, then. I'll show you.
Geralt|Dogs more dangerous than wolves? Don't think so.
Temerian Peasant 03|It's the truth. Know why?
Geralt|No, but I guess you're about to tell me.
Temerian Peasant 03|Wolves hunt to fill their bellies. Wild dogs kill for sport.
Geralt|Just like humans.
Temerian Peasant 03|Aye, they've learned much from us. Why not cruelty, too?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|These dogs been a problem for a while now?
Temerian Peasant 03|Since the war started.
Temerian Peasant 03|Soldier on the march, he'll stop to rape a woman, strangle 'er, kill her man for a chuckle, even butcher a cow. But a dog? A kick in passin', no more.
Temerian Peasant 03|So these stray mutts form packs. They're gaunt, guts stuck to their spines, covered in scabies… but they just won't die.
Temerian Peasant 03|Cause they're clever. More so than foxes. And they hate men somethin' fierce.
Geralt|Griffin - know anything about it?
Temerian Peasant 03|Oh, not much. It's not my kinda game.
Geralt|You're his kind, though. Survival instincts alone oughta make you care.
Temerian Peasant 03|I walk silent through the woods. No griffin can hear me nor spy me.
Temerian Peasant 03|Twas here.
Temerian Peasant 03|One lay there, by the stump, headless. The other hung from a branch, guts splayed, stretchin' down to…
Temerian Peasant 03|Watch out for yourself, now.
Geralt|I'll be fine. Not the first griffin I've dealt with. Not likely to be the last, either.
Temerian Peasant 03|Hope you're right.
Temerian Peasant 03|Good huntin', now.
Geralt|Nothing to mourn. They were Nilfgaardians.
Temerian Peasant 03|They were lads, like ours. Just clad in black plate.
Temerian Peasant 03|Come. 'Tain't far… nor hard to find. Can smell the blood from here.
Temerian Peasant 03|Too late. Attacked another one.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Female. Larvae in her wounds have already hatched. Been dead at least a week.
Geralt|Other griffin must be a male.
Geralt|Deep cuts over the whole body. Not a drop of blood on the beak or claws.
Geralt|Didn't defend herself. Crept up on her while she slept.
Geralt|Beak tip's worn, gray hairs in the coat - ten, twelve years old.
Geralt|Griffins pair off for life when young. Male must be about the same age.
Geralt|Thick shaft, dense barbs - a royal griffin.
Geralt|Explains why the male I ran into was so aggressive.
Geralt|Hunted the Nilfgaardians down here in the forest first, then started prowling the area.
Geralt|Oughta look around some more.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|A stream, amber waves of grain… charming place. Perfect for an ambush.
Vesemir|I know how to choose 'em.
Vesemir|So, ready?
Geralt|Let's start. Wind's good, bait's scent will spread quickly.
Vesemir|Now all we have to do is wait.
Vesemir|Come on. We can cower in the shade of those birches.
Geralt|So, tell me… once we find Yennefer, what'll you do? Got your eye on a contract?
Vesemir|No. I'll go to Kaer Morhen.
Geralt|A little early to settle in for the winter.
Vesemir|Snows are a way off, yes… and that's what worries me.
Vesemir|Nilfgaard's crossed the Pontar in the east. Puts them maybe a week's march from Kaer Morhen. If they reach the valley before snows can cover the passes… well, we need to cover our tracks, hide our paths.
Vesemir|Speaking of winter, and wintering - think you'll come this year?
Geralt|Maybe. Might bring a guest.
Geralt|I need a minute.
Vesemir|Ehh, drag a man outta the tavern, and then… Fine, but hurry.
Vesemir|Hear that? It's close.
Geralt|Let's go give it a warm welcome.
Vesemir|Wait. Take this.
Geralt|A crossbow?
Vesemir|Won it in a card game while you ran around. Might come in handy.
Geralt|A witcher with a crossbow? We breaking with tradition?
Vesemir|Stop talking. Got a griffin to kill.
Geralt|How about that. Always lectured us on the evils, but you're a gambler yourself.
Vesemir|Well, slowpoke? Ready?
<|endoftext|>
Vesemir|Watch out!
Vesemir|Not bad, not bad.
Vesemir|Though you could stand to improve some things.
Geralt|Man spends his whole life learning.
Vesemir|Not a witcher. Unless he doesn't want to live long.
Vesemir|But more on that later. Take the griffin's head to the Black Ones, I'll ready our horses.
Vesemir|Meet me at the inn.
Geralt|For example?
Vesemir|Upward vertical strike - it's too obvious.
Vesemir|It's about to dive!
Vesemir|Damn! It's fast!
Vesemir|Don't let it get away!
Vesemir|Bleeding. It'll weaken soon.
<|endoftext|>
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|What the hell is this?
Temerian Peasant 01|R-rye.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|You take me for a blind man or a fool? This grain is rotten.
Temerian Peasant 01|I -... I didn't know.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|So a fool. Dammit, you never learn…
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Military codex, article two, section three: "For the delivery of defective goods - fifteen lashes with a knout." Make it so!
Temerian Peasant 01|No, no, no! By the gods, no!
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|What?
Geralt|Fulfilled my end of the bargain. Your turn. Where'd Yennefer go?
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|To Vizima.
Geralt|She was a day's ride from here the whole time, under my nose? Might've said so.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Yes, I might have. But you would not have killed the griffin. Tit for tat.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Halt!
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|We are not done. It's yours, this gold. I would not want you to say you were inadequately compensated.
Geralt|Guess you've dropped your good uncle act.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|It was no act. I extended a hand to these people. They spat on it.
Geralt|Could it be 'cause it held the sword that killed their loved ones?
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Hah! A moralist! And what would you do in my stead?
Geralt|Wouldn't ever be in your stead.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Tell me why you've come.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Yennefer's in Vizima. Got a few friends there, so…
Geralt|Something wrong?
Vesemir|Look around. Trouble brewing.
Geralt|Time we were on our way.
Vesemir|Mhm.
Vesemir|I'll buy some provisions for the journey. Then we'll go.
Vesemir|Geralt, we should stay out of it… just this once.
Temerian Woman 01|What happened to the Lilies?
Inkeeper Elza|Took 'em down.
Temerian Woman 01|Took 'em down? To hang a golden sun there now?
Inkeeper Elza|I cannot show Temerian colors. They'll come and burn the tavern down.
Temerian Woman 01|Maybe it's true what they say? You fond of the imperials? You Nilfgaard's whore?
Inkeeper Elza|I'll let that pass. I know grief eats at your heart.
Temerian Woman 01|You know shit. They hanged my sister - dragged her out o' the cloister like a dog. Said Nilfgaard's no place for superstition. That they don't fear the wrath of the gods. And you, do you fear it?
Temerian Woman 01|If not for Annie your child woulda choked on its navel-string. You owe your son to my sister attending to the birth. And you don't fear the gods' wrath?!
Inkeeper Elza|Let go!
Temerian Woman 01|You don't fear it, you cunt?!
Temerian Woman 01|Leave me be!
Vesemir|Recognize this medallion? You know what it means. Back off.
Geralt|You all right?
Temerian Bandit 03|They say witchers steal young'uns!
Temerian Bandit 01|That true?
Temerian Bandit 03|What'd the emperor promise you freaks? Your own land? Like he did the elves once?
Vesemir|Get out. All of you.
Temerian Bandit 01|We ain't goin' nowhere.
Temerian Bandit 01|And neither are you.
Vesemir|They won't back down now.
Geralt|I can see that.
Geralt|Who are they?
Vesemir|Patriots. Drinking their seventh round for Temeria, fists starting to itch.
Geralt|Don't see any Nilfgaardians.
Vesemir|They'll find another foe.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|You know… had a dream about you recently.
Yennefer|Knowing you, it was probably filthy.
Geralt|Just the beginning. But then--
Yennefer|But then?
Yennefer|Ride! Now!
Geralt|That brawl? We didn't start it.
Yennefer|Excuses, excuses… You've not changed a bit.
Geralt|Ye… Yen? How?
Yennefer|I received a report. About a witcher who'd appeared in White Orchard. I knew it was you. Looking for me.
Yennefer|I might've waited until you found me, but… you know me. Patience has never been my strong suit.
Yennefer|It's… good to see you, Geralt. I… I'd even embrace you… were you not covered in blood.
Geralt|Sorry… Wasn't expecting to see you. To be honest, this isn't at all how I imagined we'd meet.
Yennefer|How did you imagine it?
Vesemir|He didn't imagine you'd have a Nilfgaardian escort.
Vesemir|Don't get me wrong, Yennefer. I'm glad to see you… but I do think you owe us an explanation.
Yennefer|And I shall provide it… in Vizima. Ready your horses.
Geralt|We can talk here. Some charming orchards nearby. In bloom, even, so you almost can't smell the corpses.
Yennefer|A tempting proposition. Sadly, I must say no.
Yennefer|You see, someone awaits you in Vizima. Someone who doesn't like to be kept waiting.
Yennefer|Emperor Emhyr var Emreis… or, to those on more intimate terms with him, the White Flame Dancing on the Graves of His Foes.
Geralt|Doubt I number among that group. Far as I remember, last time we saw each other, he wanted to kill me.
Yennefer|Well, now he wishes to make you an offer.
Vesemir|The kind one can't refuse?
Yennefer|I didn't. Though I could have.
Geralt|Fine. Guess I'm willing to hear him out.
Yennefer|The emperor of Nilfgaard, lord of Metinna, Ebbing and Gemmera, sovereign of Nazair and Vicovaro, will feel honored, I'm sure.
Geralt|What about you?
Vesemir|I'm going in the opposite direction. I somehow doubt the emperor's invitation mentioned me. Besides, I've got things to do at Kaer Morhen, remember?
Geralt|Yeah, I remember. Thanks for your help, Vesemir. See you soon.
Yennefer|How's your horse? Swift?
Geralt|Can't complain. Why do you ask?
Yennefer|I'd like to be back behind some thick city walls. As soon as possible.
Geralt|Must've been a damn good offer, then.
Geralt|Not many things you'd give up your freedom for. And even fewer people.
Yennefer|The sooner we set off, the sooner you'll find out.
Geralt|Spent the last six months in the saddle. Haven't seen you for two years. Can't we take a moment to--
Yennefer|Sadly, we cannot. Someone awaits you, Geralt. Someone who doesn't like to be kept waiting.
Geralt|It's all right. It's over.
Temerian Woman 03|Leave me be! Get away!
Temerian Peasant 01|See his face? Gods save us!
Inkeeper Elza|Begone. And don't ever come back.
Vesemir|So much for not getting involved. Come on, let's go.
Geralt|Yennefer, how'd they--
Yennefer|We shall talk of this tomorrow, all right? After the audience.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Black, black… or black.
Chamberlain Emhyr|We do not like garish colors in Nilfgaard.
Chamberlain Emhyr|The gentleman will tell me once he has chosen an outfit.
Geralt|Where're my clothes?
Chamberlain Emhyr|Where they should have gone long ago. With the laundress.
Chamberlain Emhyr|They will be returned to you after the audience, clean and starched.
Chamberlain Emhyr|The gentleman will be seated on the bergère.
Geralt|The what now?
Chamberlain Emhyr|In that… chair.
Chamberlain Emhyr|Cledwyn. Please shave the gentleman - sideburns to half an inch.
Geralt|What's wrong with my beard? Always thought it added to my dignity.
Chamberlain Emhyr|It does. Yet it also detracts from your elegance. In Nilfgaard we consider beards hard on the eyes. Especially beards infested with lice.
Geralt|Been on the road a while. Fine, do your thing.
Nilfgaardian Scholar 01|Tilt your head back, please. And sit still.
Voorhis|How goes it? Preparations for the audience proceeding as planned?
Chamberlain Emhyr|Yes, general. The gentleman will be more or less presentable.
Geralt|Who's this guy? He a barber, too?
Voorhis|No. Morvran Voorhis. Commander of the Alba Division. Yennefer's escort - they were my men, all of them.
Voorhis|Indeed… "were," for none have returned to Vizima, have they? I truly wonder what happened on the road yesterday. Perhaps you could enlighten me? You have time… and a razor to your throat.
Geralt|Your men died in battle. As soldiers tend to.
Voorhis|I see their fate does not trouble you… overly.
Geralt|True. But I'm guessing the fate of those whose country they invaded didn't overly trouble them.
Voorhis|Nordlings - ugh. We can bathe you, shave you and clothe you, but teaching you manners… that will be a challenge.
Geralt|Nice meeting you, too.
Nilfgaardian Scholar 01|Done. Shall I shave him once more, against the grain?
Voorhis|No. He himself is very much against the grain - that's enough. Farewell, witcher. Or rather, see you soon.
Chamberlain Emhyr|Good. Now the gentleman may dress.
Chamberlain Emhyr|Sadly, I did not receive exact measurements. If the garments chafe, our tailor will adjust them.
Geralt|Wild Hunt killed them.
Voorhis|A cavalcade of wraiths dashing across the night sky? These omens of war the peasantry babbles about? Expect me to believe that?
Geralt|Frankly, I don't really give a damn.
Voorhis|And prepare to answer some questions.
Chamberlain Emhyr|General, I am not certain this is the appropriate time.
Voorhis|I can't think of a better time. Men turn honest when they feel a blade at their throat.
Voorhis|Morvran Voorhis, commander of the Alba Division. Before they take you in to see the emperor, witcher, there's some information I need you to verify. It's a formality, but one that must be seen to.
Geralt|Sure. Paperwork's gotta be in order.
Voorhis|So, Geralt of Rivia. Place of birth - unknown, parents - unknown, age - unknown… All insignificant details. Let us proceed to more recent events - the siege of La Valette Castle. The fate of the defending commander, one Aryan.
Geralt|Foltest ordered me to clear the path. The boy stood in my way.
Voorhis|Cutting down the la Valette heir - this made no impression on you? I suppose it wouldn't. What's some baron to an assassin of kings?
Voorhis|Moving on. You then found shelter in charming Flotsam, and from there made your way to Vergen. My question is - "how?"
Geralt|I got out of Flotsam with Vernon Roche, commander of the Blue Stripes and…
Voorhis|…A murderer of nonhumans. We know this gentleman well, witcher. You forge interesting alliances.
Geralt|Something tells me my most interesting is yet to come. Go on, next question - before my beard grows back in.
Voorhis|We shall shave you again if it does. Very well. The infamous summit at Loc Muinne. You were there. And once again meddled in the affairs of the mighty.
Geralt|The mighty had imprisoned Triss Merigold. Oughta know I care about her. And I tend to rescue those I care about.
Voorhis|And so you did, handing Radovid control of the Conclave and Council of Mages in the process.
Geralt|Nilfgaard recently started a war. Unprovoked. So do us both a favor and stop moralizing.
Nilfgaardian Scholar 01|The gentleman must sit still. I am almost done.
Voorhis|I'm afraid I might find that difficult. Because from what I know, shortly afterwards you watched a defective megascope blow your friend Síle de Tansarville to bits.
Geralt|I watched her get in the megascope, but ultimately freed her… from the trap your man Letho of Gulet had set. Write that down. I wanna be sure the paperwork's in order now.
Voorhis|Well, national interest calls on one to forge difficult alliances at times. Alliances with witchers included.
Geralt|Well, that alliance has been dissolved. Irrevocably. I killed Letho in Loc Muinne.
Voorhis|So we heard. It's a good thing you did. Saved our agents some messy and difficult work.
Voorhis|I believe that is all. Your signature, please, affirming you stated the whole truth and nothing but the truth, on pain of imprisonment or death, et cetera, et cetera. Here… and here.
Chamberlain Emhyr|With these formalities seen to, I would ask the general to leave the room. We shall be choosing the gentleman's attire. An important matter, but one that does not require the general's assistance.
Voorhis|Shame… I might have given you some advice. So long, Geralt. Good luck with your audience.
Geralt|Feels more like I'm being readied for a wedding.
Chamberlain Emhyr|Were that so, I would have prepared the gentleman a frock, a tailcoat, or possibly a dinner jacket. In point of fact, the gentleman will choose from these garments.
Geralt|That an ongoing alliance? What's Letho up to?
Voorhis|I had hoped you would answer that question.
Geralt|Ah. So Letho's hiding from you. Must have a good reason. Was there a shift in national interest that might've caused that?
Geralt|I don't know where he is. Wouldn't tell you if I did, anyway. Blade or no blade to my throat.
Geralt|Huh, an old acquaintance, more like. Not so close that I felt bad for her, but close enough that I knew she deserved it.
Voorhis|"He believes he alone knows what is good and what is evil, and that this gives him the right to dispense justice."
Voorhis|Your comrade, Letho of Gulet, described you so. Quite accurate, I'd say.
Geralt|My comrade - your agent.
Geralt|Not the way I see it. I helped a friend rescue a child.
Voorhis|Anaïs was not just any child. She was a pawn in a game you did not understand. You and Roche did not rescue her at all. At most, you moved her from one edge of the board to the other, fanning the flames of conflict.
Geralt|Not at all. I meddled in a personal affair. Helped Iorveth lift the spell that held Saskia.
Voorhis|Yes, and in doing so gave Radovid a reason to begin his witch hunts. Congratulations.
Geralt|I left Flotsam with Iorveth, commander of a Scoia'tael unit.
Voorhis|A slayer of monsters and a slayer of men… you forge interesting alliances.
Geralt|We fought on opposing sides, true. Then we landed in the same dungeon. Aryan escaped, set fire to the castle on his way out.
Voorhis|Ahh, so that is how the blaze started. Our reports suggested the dragon was responsible.
Geralt|Fine… then what? Gonna do my nails, too?
Chamberlain Emhyr|If time permits. Sadly, the day is short, while the list of hygienic and cosmetic treatments that the gentleman should undergo is really rather long.
Chamberlain Emhyr|Hmm. It must suffice.
Geralt|Think Emhyr cares if I'm clean?
Chamberlain Emhyr|The gentleman will refer to His Imperial Majesty by his full title or not at all.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|A studded doublet and a sword on my back - that's what would satisfy me. But tough, when in Nilfgaard…
Chamberlain Emhyr|Yes…?
Geralt|It's a saying. So what now? Powder my nose?
Chamberlain Emhyr|No need. The gentleman's complexion is light enough.
Chamberlain Emhyr|The gentleman is to stand before the Ruler of the North and South. I must confirm that he knows how to bow.
Geralt|Confirm away.
Chamberlain Emhyr|Please watch.
Chamberlain Emhyr|Leg extended, hand flat, head down, chin to chest.
Chamberlain Emhyr|The gentleman will rehearse.
Chamberlain Emhyr|Wrong, wrong, wrong.
Chamberlain Emhyr|Once more.
Chamberlain Emhyr|Hmm, lacking fluidity and grace. But we've learned to expect less of Nordlings.
Chamberlain Emhyr|Come with me.
Chamberlain Emhyr|Please, this is neither the time nor the place for such antics.
Chamberlain Emhyr|The gentleman will watch carefully.
Geralt|Gotta be kidding.
Chamberlain Emhyr|Not at all. I am mortally serious.
Chamberlain Emhyr|Does the gentleman know the penalty for breaches of etiquette in the emperor's presence? Two hundred lashes.
Chamberlain Emhyr|I do not wish that upon him, so I will not let him leave until I am confident that he knows how to behave.
Geralt|I'm not some boor. I know how to bow.
Chamberlain Emhyr|Please, demonstrate.
Chamberlain Emhyr|That, sir, is how you might bow to a whore on a street corner, not to the emperor of Nilfgaard.
Geralt|Rather try on something else.
Chamberlain Emhyr|Go ahead. We've time.
Chamberlain Emhyr|This might come as news to the gentleman, but a towel wrapped around one's waist is not fitting attire for an audience.
Chamberlain Emhyr|The gentleman will kindly dress.
Chamberlain Emhyr|Black suits the gentleman.
Chamberlain Emhyr|Does the outfit satisfy the gentleman?
Chamberlain Emhyr|And they say clothes do not make the man.
Chamberlain Emhyr|Hmm. A touch tight in the waist… but it will do.
Chamberlain Emhyr|I believe the gentleman's forgetting something?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Take it you didn't summon me to reminisce about the good old days, so…
Emhyr|Silence.
Emhyr|My daughter Cirilla… she's returned, and she's in danger. The Wild Hunt pursues her.
Emhyr|You will find her and bring her to me.
Geralt|How many men in your army? Twenty thousand? Thirty?
Geralt|So why me?
Emhyr|You know why. Because she trusts you.
Geralt|She trusts me, yes. So tell me why you're looking for her. Doubt it's about making up for all those lost years.
Emhyr|For reasons of state. As always.
Emhyr|Enough of this banter. You will agree regardless.
Emhyr|If for no other reason than because I shall pay you. More than you customarily receive for a contract. Considerably more.
Geralt|I need information, not motivation. Ciri… leaves few tracks. She'll be hard to find.
Emhyr|My corps of spies will help you. Count on them, and my army, should the need arise.
Emhyr|Yennefer will tell you the rest.
Emhyr|This audience is finished. Mererid!
Emhyr|Take him to the sorceress.
Geralt|Save your generosity for those whose homes your armies have razed.
Geralt|I'll do it for Ciri. Not for your gold.
Emhyr|Your motives do not interest me. Only results.
Geralt|Are you sure? Ciri… left. Went far, far away.
Emhyr|Do you believe I'd drag you here in the middle of a war to discuss a rumor?
Geralt|I think anyone can be wrong, even an emperor.
Emhyr|I had forgotten how insolent you can be.
Emhyr|I haven't the time to convince you, nor the desire, in fact. Yennefer will do that - after the audience.
Chamberlain Emhyr|{Ym'grymie aep Aard Ker'zaer, Deithwen Addan yn Carn aep Morvudd, Emhyr var Emreis!}[Bow before His Imperial Majesty, The White Flame Dancing on the Graves of his Foes, Emhyr var Emreis!]
Chamberlain Emhyr|Bow.
Emhyr|I thought you bowed before no man.
Geralt|Didn't want to disappoint the chamberlain. We're friends.
Emhyr|So many months at Foltest's court… yet you still haven't mastered the basics of etiquette.
Geralt|Know what they say - can't teach an old wolf new tricks?
Geralt|Your Imperial Majesty.
Chamberlain Emhyr|{Areir aep tho orde... } [As Your Majesty wished…]
Emhyr|{Evelienn namyn vatt’ghern va vort.}[All except the witcher will leave.]
Temerian Peasant 02|Pardon, my lord. I was sure I wouldn't--
Emhyr|Do you know who I am?
Temerian Peasant 02|Yes.
Temerian Peasant 02|Emhyr var Emreis, emperor of Nilfgaard, the White Flame Dancing on the Graves of his Foes.
Emhyr|You are Foltest's servant?
Temerian Peasant 02|I was, aye… D-do you really do it?
Emhyr|Do what?
Temerian Peasant 02|Dance on your enemies' graves?
Emhyr|{Guards!
Emhyr|No one's ever asked me that.
Emhyr|{Gàrracaer ess mëot leeg caer. } [The garden was to be empty.]
Nilfgaardian Imperial 01|{A'ess, Aard Ker'zaer. N'evellien am caed…} [It was, Your Imperial Majesty. No one was to…]
Temerian Peasant 02|Have mercy, my lord. Merely looking after the tree. Thought no one would--
Nilfgaardian Imperial 02|Silence, Temerian. Don't speak until spoken to.
Emhyr|{Ax. } [Axe.]
Nilfgaardian Imperial 02|Yes, Your Imperial Majesty.
Emhyr|This is Temeria no more. Not the garden, not the palace, not the country. It's Nilfgaard now.
Temerian Peasant 02|Aye, Nilfgaard, so be it. Been caring for the tree since the days of Medell, Foltest's father.
Emhyr|Do you know how Foltest died?
Temerian Peasant 02|Murdered in La Valette Castle.
Emhyr|Where was your royal guard at the time?
Temerian Peasant 02|King was alone. They say… say the assassin caught him in the solar.
Emhyr|Solitude, yes. It can be a deadly trap when one is not attentive.
<|endoftext|>
Chamberlain Emhyr|Follow me, if the gentleman pleases.
Chamberlain Emhyr|Please keep close. There are many honorable guests in the palace, whom the gentleman…
Geralt|…disgusts?
Chamberlain Emhyr|…need not bother.
Chamberlain Emhyr|Did the gentleman not understand? Did I not emphasize adequately that one must bow to the emperor?
Geralt|Relax. Nothing happened.
Chamberlain Emhyr|To the gentleman. But I shall be punished.
Geralt|How?
Chamberlain Emhyr|Please keep close and bother no one. We've had enough breaches of etiquette for one day.
Chamberlain Emhyr|Did I not request…?
Chamberlain Emhyr|Is the gentleman not in a hurry to see the sorceress?
Chamberlain Emhyr|Once the gentleman is done, he should see me to retrieve his possessions.
<|endoftext|>
Voorhis|{Vissean ess'va aen Novigrad?}[Have the envoys returned from Novigrad?]
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|{Yeá… An neen. Raadsliden ae'enect, es Tunn esse saor an neenphàir.}[Yes, empty-handed. The ealdormen decreed the city shall remain independent and neutral.]
Voorhis|{Esse'sidh avside aep feansa neen math theenk. Neen cofhurtail an ennv pa vall. } [Straddling the fence - foolish idea. Not only uncomfortable, but one is liable to fall.]
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|{Ess vraag, que'ss side…}[Question is, to which side…]
Voorhis|{Dùth. Visse var Attre ess pa'as aep.}[The right one. Ambassador var Attre will make certain.]
Voorhis|{Tedd a'taeghane, en'ca land n'ees a evelloë saor. Aep Toussaint…}[These days it's unwise for small realms to remain fully independent. Take Toussaint…]
Geralt|Mind if I interrupt?
Voorhis|Why not join in instead?
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|We're discussing neutrality. How difficult it is to preserve.
Geralt|Know a thing or two about that.
Voorhis|Care to explain?
Geralt|Never changes. I try to stay out of things, stand aside… then comes an urgent summons and an offer I can't refuse.
Geralt|Enough about that. Mind if we change the subject?
Geralt|So, talked to the emperor.
Voorhis|Hm. Why did he summon you?
Geralt|So not even you know.
Voorhis|No. But I wager it's an ordinary witchers' contract.
Geralt|Mhm. Some werebbubbs.
Geralt|See you.
Voorhis|Soon, mind you.
Geralt|Still worth trying.
Voorhis|Because?
Geralt|Because there are few causes worth serving. Even fewer men.
Voorhis|Yes, Geralt?
<|endoftext|>
Temerian Noble 01|I was told I'd be received first thing in the morning. And it's past noon!
Nilfgaardian Imperial 01|Calm yourself.
Temerian Noble 01|Wha– What?! Do you know who you're talking to, soldier? I'm Herevard the Second, Prince of Ellander.
Temerian Noble 01|Not only am I made to wait here like some supplicant, but with who for company? A tinter!
Temerian Merchant 01|Tanner. Master of the Tanners' Guild.
Temerian Noble 01|As if it makes a damned difference! I demand--
Nilfgaardian Imperial 01|Calm down.
Nilfgaardian Imperial 01|The emperor demands silence. Those who disturb face harsh punishment. No matter their birth.
Temerian Noble 01|A witcher! Oh, that's just perfect!
<|endoftext|>
Yennefer|Geralt! That tunic - you look positively smashing.
Geralt|Ugh, dying to take it off.
Yennefer|I'd consider that a proposition under different circumstances… one I might even take you up on. But we've matters to attend to.
Yennefer|Now do you understand why I'm at Emhyr's court?
Geralt|Mhm. And seems we're in the same boat, now.
Geralt|Ciri - she's really back? No chance he's mistaken?
Yennefer|Look - that's more or less what she looks like now, or so our agents claim. Our little witcher's grown into a young lady.
Geralt|Hm, so they're "our" agents now? My, my… you've clearly settled in quick.
Yennefer|Geralt, don't twist my words.
Yennefer|I know who Emhyr is. He started this war and its bloodshed. He had my friends killed. But I haven't any other choice, so please… let's not belabor the pros and cons and instead focus on finding Ciri. All right?
Geralt|Right. Emhyr said the Wild Hunt's after her. I'd find that hard to believe - before what happened yesterday. How did they track us down?
Yennefer|Because of me. You see… I've spent months searching for Ciri. Using locating spells, haruspicy, geomancy, anything, really. I knew the Wild Hunt might sense it, perhaps even find me, but… I thought I'd tricked them.
Geralt|Well, guess you were wrong.
Yennefer|Hm. I've sensed them on my trail, hunting me, for some time. If not for you and Emhyr's soldiers, they'd have gotten what they were after.
Yennefer|I can't risk another encounter like that. It's time to put away the magic, turn to more traditional methods… to the best tracker I know.
Yennefer|You must find her, Geralt. Before the Wild Hunt does.
Geralt|So where's Ciri been seen, exactly?
Yennefer|In two places - Velen and Novigrad.
Yennefer|The trail in Velen is most promising. You should make that your first stop. Ask for a merchant named Hendrik at the Inn at the Crossroads. One of the emperor's agents, he should get in touch with you.
Geralt|That's it? No passwords, secret handshakes?
Yennefer|None. Sorry to spoil your fun, your boyhood fantasies about the crafts of the trade.
Yennefer|All we have in Novigrad are unconfirmed reports, rumors. But there you will have the help of our mutual acquaintance.
Yennefer|Triss Merigold. Apparently she's got a cozy flat on the main square.
Geralt|Sure she'll be delighted to see me. What about you? What will you do?
Yennefer|I shall sail for Skellige. There was a magic explosion there recently, blew half a forest down. I believe this had something to do with Ciri. I'll be in Kaer Trolde. Join me there once you've learned something.
Geralt|Guess this means we need to split up again. Not my preference, but I understand. Clock's ticking.
Yennefer|It is indeed. So, why don't I teleport you to Velen, get you there at once?
Geralt|Not gonna happen. I'll go on horseback. Soon as I can get changed.
Yennefer|Have it your way. Oh, and… you really look quite dashing in black velvet.
Geralt|Think so? Maybe I can have some of my armor lined with it. Hm. Good luck, Yen.
Yennefer|Same to you. And if you wish to learn what's happened in the world while you and Vesemir roamed the wilderness, talk to Ambassador var Attre. That's him, over there.
Yennefer|And Geralt, I know it's wartime, but try not to be a hero, all right? Just check those leads and come back to me - in one piece.
Yennefer|I shall be waiting.
Geralt|One thing before we go… Why didn't you contact me? Didn't need me, didn't even want to see me?
Yennefer|I didn't want to spoil things. I'd heard you and Triss made a great couple.
Geralt|Yen… I'd lost my memory.
Yennefer|Really - that's your excuse?
Yennefer|Let's drop it, all right? "It's not what you think" or "it helped me understand how much I love you" - I don't wish to hear it, any of it.
Geralt|The Wild Hunt - what could it want from Ciri?
Yennefer|I've no clue, Geralt. Might've written them to ask, but I don't have their address.
Yennefer|I know as much as you do. It must be about her blood, her gift.
Yennefer|As for what the Hunt wishes to do with that gift, I-- I'd prefer not to think about, really.
Geralt|How about that… she's grown up.
Yennefer|It's been years since you trained together at Kaer Morhen.
Yennefer|A great deal has changed.
Geralt|You haven't. Not a bit.
Yennefer|I missed those awkward compliments of yours…
Yennefer|But let's focus on Ciri, all right?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Ambassador var Attre?
Geralt|Yennefer suggested I ask you about current events. The war, and so on.
Ambassador Var Attre|Of course. The emperor's servants should keep no secrets from each other. If you will, let us approach the map.
Geralt|How's the war going? I mean, apart from the fact that Nilfgaard's triumph is imminent.
Ambassador Var Attre|I assume this to be a private conversation. We've no witnesses, so let's dispense with propaganda, even that shrouded in irony.
Ambassador Var Attre|Our offensive was going splendidly - until winter came. Aedirn was in such disarray that we encountered no resistance. We had reached the Pontar before the first snows.
Ambassador Var Attre|Only a weakened Kaedwen remained… and Radovid's Redania, which had ignored the rest of the North's pleas for help. We thought they'd sue for peace, perhaps even submit to vassalization. We waited for spring, certain of victory.
Geralt|Radovid? Submit?
Ambassador Var Attre|Yes. A vain hope, I agree. Radovid sent no peace envoys, nor did he advance on our positions. Instead, he trudged over the snow-bound Kestrel Mountains… and attacked Kaedwen, his ally.
Ambassador Var Attre|This attack took the Kaedweni by surprise. They were still mourning the loss of their king. Rudderless and dejected, they laid down their arms after a few lost skirmishes - and joined Radovid.
Ambassador Var Attre|And so by spring, instead of two weak enemies we had only one powerful one.
Geralt|That admiration I hear in your voice?
Ambassador Var Attre|Radovid is our foe… but I cannot deny he is clever. He played us for fools. Particularly dense ones at that.
Ambassador Var Attre|Returning to the war… This spring there was a massive battle in the marshes of Velen. Massive, yet indecisive. Both sides suffered enormous losses. Unprecedented, even.
Ambassador Var Attre|Radovid has retreated across the Pontar. He's safe for now… until reinforcements arrive from the south. Then Emperor Emhyr var Emreis will deal with him once and for all.
Geralt|Couldn't you just go home? Save everyone a lot of marching. Not to mention a few human lives.
Ambassador Var Attre|I'm afraid the stakes are too high to fold now. We can only go all in.
Geralt|What about Kovir?
Ambassador Var Attre|Kovir values its neutrality. Enough not to lend its armies or, more importantly, even its coin to either side.
Ambassador Var Attre|Took the Kaedweni completely by surprise. King Henselt fought on the front line, as always… and that is where he died. His soldiers lost the will to fight. They joined Radovid's ranks.
Geralt|Hm. How do things look in Velen?
Ambassador Var Attre|As bad as ever… perhaps worse.
Ambassador Var Attre|This land never flowed with milk and honey, and now it flows with blood. Armies have swept through it several times, trampling fields, looting granaries, burning villages. Famine grips the populace.
Geralt|Mhm. So how's ruling that earthly paradise going for you?
Ambassador Var Attre|Not well, to be honest. Our forces are spread thin as it is, and Velen is chiefly swampy forests that are difficult to control. We've had several patrols never return to their camps.
Ambassador Var Attre|Thus, we've temporarily delegated authority in this region to a certain Nordling, a former low-ranking officer in the Temerian army, one Phillip Strenger. Better known by his nom de guerre, the Bloody Baron.
Ambassador Var Attre|I advise you well - avoid him.
Geralt|Any news from Novigrad? Is the free city still free?
Ambassador Var Attre|Yes, although everyone knows this won't last. Radovid is in Oxenfurt, and the emperor is here, in Vizima. At Novigrad's doorstep, both. And both require coin and ships. Novigrad can provide these.
Ambassador Var Attre|Which is why the mood in the city is rather… well, on edge.
Geralt|Meaning?
Ambassador Var Attre|How do men deal with fear? They seek reassurance… and scapegoats. The Church of the Eternal Fire understands this perfectly. And so it promises to improve the lives of its flock by pointing out the guilty.
Ambassador Var Attre|Who started the war? Who profits from it? Why, it's obvious - mages, elves, dwarves. In a word, any and all deviants.
Ambassador Var Attre|I've been stationed in Novigrad for thirteen years. First as a consul, then as ambassador. I've seen a great deal - cruelty, cynicism, greed. But what is happening there now concerns me greatly.
Ambassador Var Attre|Nothing. The islanders pride themselves on that, don't they? Doing everything according to tradition? As their forefathers did.
Ambassador Var Attre|And like their forefathers, they quarrel with each other, pillage, occasionally attack our transports. This is cumbersome… but nothing more. Skellige has always been a footnote to history. And so it shall remain.
Geralt|Sound awfully confident. What if King Bran manages to unite the jarls? Lead all the clans against your fleet?
Ambassador Var Attre|King Bran is a feeble old man. From what I know he barely remembers the names of his own vassals. Uniting all might prove difficult.
Geralt|Thanks for your help.
Ambassador Var Attre|Think nothing of it. May the Great Sun light your Path.
Ambassador Var Attre|Yes, Geralt? Something else?
Ambassador Var Attre|That is I. And you must be Geralt. The witcher known as the White Wolf… or alternatively, the Butcher of Blaviken.
Geralt|Geralt's fine, really.
<|endoftext|>
Nilfgaardian Soldier 02|Hey, you! Halt!
Nilfgaardian Soldier 02|Geralt of Rivia, correct? You were in White Orchard recently? Near Vizima?
Geralt|Mhm. Charming village. If you don't mind rotting corpses.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 02|There'd have been one more if not for you. Lena… she survived, thanks to your potion.
Geralt|Nice to see a Nilfgaardian soldier so concerned about the fate of some simple Nordling. But kind of surprising, too.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 02|That night, when the griffin attacked her… she was on her way to meet me. In the woods near the garrison.
Geralt|Lousy spot for a romantic encounter. If the griffin hadn't gotten her, something else would've.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 02|I know… but I could only ever get away between watches. Those woods, they were close.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 02|Listen, Lena… she has not fully recovered. I took her with me when I was transfered, thought she might get better. But no - she says nothing, recognizes no one, sleeps most of the day.
Geralt|I warned Tomira. Witcher potions have powerful, usually permanent side effects. Can't do anything to help now. Maybe a mage could.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 02|I don't know whether to thank you, or curse you for not letting her die with dignity.
Geralt|Trust me - choice I had to make was harder.
Geralt|Mhm. Love knows no bounds.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 02|Not so. Her parents told her that if they saw her with a Nilfgaardian, they would shave her head, cut out her tongue and banish her from their home.

Geralt|Greetings.
Verden Peasant 05|Hm?
Geralt|Got any beer?
Verden Peasant 05|The Black Ones burned down the brewery, so I've got some charred oak spirit.
Geralt|This the Inn at the Crossroads?
Verden Peasant 05|Tis indeed. Novigrad road wends through 'ere. But armies and bandits - that's all that's on 'im now.
Geralt|Novigrad a long way off?
Verden Peasant 05|Not that long. But with the Redanians just the other side of the Pontar, you'll not get there without a pass.
Verden Peasant 05|When we had hunger here, the pox, folk tried to flee there. Reds turned 'em back, or drowned 'em in the river.
Geralt|The Black Ones've brought you some grief.
Verden Peasant 05|Huh, no more than the Redanians. Same beast to my eyes. Reds stole our grain, said it were for the brave lads dyin' as they defend the Northern Realms.
Verden Peasant 05|Black Ones now make us give up what we stashed from the Reds. Say the emperor'll bring peace, but that comes at a price.
Verden Peasant 05|And when they clashed, red against black, corpse eaters came to feast on the dead. Cemetaurs and strixens crept from the woods, sniffin' for carrion. Howl so fierce these days that folk daren't leave their huts come night.
Geralt|Nothing on the spit.
Verden Peasant 05|We've naught to eat, that's certain.
Geralt|Many strangers come through here?
Verden Peasant 05|I'll not prattle about other folk. Suppose you're a tongue wagger - it'll only bring me grief.
Geralt|I wanna know about travelers, not locals.
Verden Peasant 05|They come, they go… I don't want trouble - with locals or travelers.
Geralt|Food's gotten scarce.
Verden Peasant 05|Folk venture into the fields before sunup to catch frogs, gather acorns, grind'm into flour. Whosoever's got a hen don't sleep nights so he can watch his bird.
Geralt|Can't your dogs do that?
Verden Peasant 05|One night a few weeks back, Temerian guerillas crept from the forest. They snuck 'tween the huts, clubs in hand.
Verden Peasant 05|Dogs bayed and barked, then howled and yelped, and then fell silent as the grave. That rabble then gathered near the old pits. I saw 'em - built fires, salted the meat…
Verden Peasant 05|Only the wildest of hounds about now, the kind that don't come near men. Except when hunger drives them to attack, that is.
Geralt|Who rules these lands now? Nilfgaard?
Verden Peasant 05|Black Ones're garrisoned nearby. But they're still too weak to rule. So they struck a deal with the baron. Man's a puppet of sorts, but it's clear they've promised him somethin' in return.
Verden Peasant 05|If he had his way, he'd serve no man but himself.
Geralt|A baron?
Verden Peasant 05|Aye, a righteous man and a just lord. Can't say an ill word about 'im.
Geralt|Got a family name for me?
Verden Peasant 05|Dunno naught about families. But I'll not say an ill word about him or them.
Geralt|Wouldn't dream of making you badmouth him. Just wanna know a little more. He ruled for long?
Verden Peasant 05|Not long. And you'll have to be content with that, I'll say no more.
Geralt|Gotta go.
Verden Peasant 05|Such a shame.
Verden Peasant 05|Why you pesterin' me?
Geralt|Looking for a man. Goes by Hendrik.
Verden Peasant 05|What you want with 'im?
Geralt|Wanna talk to him.
Verden Peasant 05|What about?
Geralt|Gimme a bottle of something strong.
Verden Peasant 05|You gotta go! I'll open the back way for ye!
Geralt|Haven't finished my drink yet.
Baron Bandit Strong 03|Innkeep! Vodka!
Baron Bandit Weak 01|Who's this 'un?
Baron Bandit Weak 02|Brave warrior, looks like. Got two swords, see?
Baron Bandit Strong 03|Oi, gray boy! What's the point of havin' two swords?
Baron Bandit Weak 02|Wonder if he keeps an extra prick in his trousers, too.
Baron Bandit Strong 03|You fuckin' deaf?
Baron Bandit Strong 03|Gonna say who you are, or do I need to loosen your tongue with me knife?
Geralt|Someone who'd prefer not to be bothered while he's having a drink.
Baron Bandit Strong 03|Heh! Hear that? We've a distinguished gentleman in our midst!
Baron Bandit Weak 02|Shine your boots, guv'nor?
Geralt|No. Wouldn't want the grime on your hands to rub off on them.
Baron Bandit Strong 03|Bolo… did you hear what I heard?
Geralt|Go away. Or I'll kill you.
Baron Bandit Strong 03|Dammit. Enough!
Geralt|I'm a witcher.
Geralt|Heard you wondering about my swords. Well, one's for monsters, the other - for humans.
Geralt|Only got one prick, though. In case you're wondering about that, too.
Baron Bandit Strong 03|Don't touch 'im. Don't even look at 'im. Worse than lepers, that lot.
Baron Bandit Weak 01|Saw one in action once. Killed a half dozen, blood everywhere - freak didn't even show a drop of sweat.
Baron Bandit Weak 02|Got the stench o' corpses on 'im.
Verden Peasant 05|If you wanna rest, come with me. I've a bench you can use.
Geralt|How about I buy everybody a round?
Baron Bandit Weak 01|Why would you?
Geralt|Got the coin for it, simple as that.
Baron Bandit Strong 03|I don't drink with strangers.
Geralt|We share a round, won't be strangers anymore. Then we go our separate ways.
Baron Bandit Strong 03|And which way might yours be?
Geralt|Is it just me, or is that none of your fucking business?
Baron Bandit Strong 03|I must be hearing things.
Baron Bandit Weak 01|You ain't. He meant to insult.
Baron Bandit Strong 03|I'll have to kill 'im, then.
Geralt|On my way to Novigrad.
Baron Bandit Strong 03|City of whores and whoremongers.
Geralt|Who are you?
Baron Bandit Strong 03|Oh, aye - an' why do you care?
Geralt|Like to know who I'm drinking with - just like you.
Baron Bandit Strong 03|We're the baron's men. And you're in his land.
Geralt|To your health. And mine.
Baron Bandit Strong 03|Bottoms up.
Geralt|A baron holds these lands? Must be quite a man - doesn't seem to care a lick about all the imperials here. More and more arriving, too.
Baron Bandit Weak 01|Bloody Baron's not some poncey prick son of a rich lord. So no - he's not like to piss his britches at the sight of a black-winged head.
Geralt|This is interesting stuff.
Baron Bandit Weak 01|Our baron's baron 'cause that's the way we want it. And if that strikes anyone as wrong, well, we encourage 'em to speak their mind.
Geralt|Just curious. Kinda wondering what you're doing here.
Baron Bandit Strong 03|I don't like curious types.
Geralt|Really. How badly?
Baron Bandit Strong 03|So bad that I kill 'em.
Geralt|Got company. Who is it?
<|endoftext|>
Verden Peasant 05|Have you any idea what the baron'll do when he learns of this butchery?! The village - he'll tear it apart before anyone can say it was some wanderin' mutant done it! An iron fist, he's got--
Geralt|Where's Hendrik?
Verden Peasant 05|You deaf?! Y'understand what I'm sayin'? Baron won't let this stand!
Geralt|Calm down. Your baron's no idiot. Seriously doubt he'll think you locals cut his men down with farming implements. Now where's Hendrik?
Verden Peasant 05|Man lives in Heatherton.
Geralt|Don't know where that is.
Verden Peasant 05|Other side of the hill. Looked thataway this morn and saw a strange glow. Imperials on the raid, perhaps, but who knows…
Geralt|Anything else you can tell me about Hendrik?
Verden Peasant 05|Odd fellow. Arrived from who knows where and for no apparent reason. Shacked up with a widow whose husband was stabbed for a scrap of bread.
Geralt|Baron's men don't like strangers.
Verden Peasant 05|Aye, an' he stays out o' their way. Always seems to know when they're comin', always manages to disappear.
Geralt|Thanks, innkeep.
Geralt|Thanks, innkeep.
Verden Peasant 05|Go out the back. More o' the baron's men in the village.
Geralt|No need to worry about me.
Verden Peasant 05|I'd rather you not make any more trouble - for yourself, for us both.
Verden Peasant 05|Thanks for not startin' a row with those swine.
Geralt|I don't generally poke my nose in other people's business.
Verden Peasant 05|Lookin' to stay the night?
Geralt|No.
Verden Peasant 05|Ahh…
Geralt|I'm looking for Hendrik.
<|endoftext|>
Verden Peasant 02|Pour me another, love.
Verden Woman 03|You've 'ad enough.
Verden Peasant 02|No wench'll ration my vodka! Pour, dammit! 'Fore ye taste the back of me hand.
Verden Peasant 02|Whadda ye want?
Geralt|You Hendrik?
Verden Peasant 02|No…
Verden Woman 03|Don't natter with that 'un. It'll bring trouble.
Geralt|Who rules this land now?
Verden Peasant 02|Baron does.
Geralt|By whose decree - Temerian or Nilfgaardian?
Verden Peasant 02|Uh, by his own. War's on - you got the men, you take the land.
Verden Woman 03|Why're you so curious? Eh?
Geralt|So long.
Verden Woman 03|High time we went home.
Verden Peasant 02|We'll go once I've drunk.
Geralt|Got some questions.
Verden Peasant 02|Uh-huh?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Godspeed.
Geralt|Farewell. And peace of mind to you.
Verden Old Man 01|Hm. Mh hm hm…
Geralt|Calm down. It's over.
Verden Old Man 01|Aye, it's over… All's past, never to be restored. I'll not forget that ever.
Geralt|What happened?
Verden Old Man 01|I dunno… don't wanna know. They came for Hendrik… and they got 'im.
Geralt|Tell me what happened here. Step by step.
Verden Old Man 01|They took 'em… Took 'em all…
Geralt|Looking for a man named Hendrik. Supposed to live in this village.
Verden Old Man 01|Aye, he did. No longer. They nabbed 'im in that hut. If you'd o' heard the cries, sir… if you'd o' heard how a man can scream… how he can suffer.
Geralt|Wish I could help.
Verden Old Man 01|Ye can't. None can. This… this end's it all, everything…
Geralt|What happened here?
Verden Old Man 01|Hm, hm… black riders…
Verden Old Man 01|Death descended… I felt its icy breath.
Verden Old Man 01|He who's seen death gallop through shall know no peace…!
Verden Old Man 01|The sun was waning, see… and the dusk went crimson like blood. Thought to meself, "Strange. The toads - I cannot hear them."
Verden Old Man 01|I know not what happened there, save terror through and through. Hendrik screamed, then he begged. By the end he could do naught but moan…
Verden Old Man 01|Weren't here long, the terrors. Yet the village froze like in the heart of winter…
Geralt|You in that hut when they rode off?
Verden Old Man 01|No. And I'll not set foot there. Never.
Verden Old Man 01|Begone! Leave me be, whoever you is! Get away!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Tortured him.
Geralt|Maybe they missed something.
Geralt|Need to check his pockets.
Geralt|Trousers're stiff, as if hung out to dry mid-winter.
Geralt|Maybe hid something in his jerkin.
Geralt|Damn, he's cold as ice. Nothing here.
Geralt|Should check his boots.
Geralt|Blood, congealed…
Geralt|Key hidden in his boot.
Geralt|Gotta fit a keyhole. Somewhere nearby, hopefully.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Face scorched, hard to identify.
Geralt|There's a draft… Gotta be a space under this rubble.
Geralt|Guess I should do some cleaning.
Geralt|Hmm… Candle holder's loose. Wonder if I can turn it.
Geralt|No. Did something wrong. Gotta start again.
Geralt|Hmm… interesting.
Geralt|Hm, guess I got it right.
Geralt|Air's strange… Like dropping into a deep cellar on a hot day… And the mist…
Geralt|Left his ledgers out. No merchant worth his salt does that.
Geralt|Valuables left unlocked - on display, almost. Lost his mind or…? Hm…
Geralt|Left his valuables out as a decoy, to draw attention… Question is, away from what?
Geralt|Lotta inkwells… different tone ink in each. Best guess? Expert forger - seals, letters, documents.
Geralt|Traces of ice around the footprints. Really?
Geralt|Village wasn't plundered, hut wasn't looted. These weren't raiders or thieves.
Geralt|Looks like folk were here moments ago. Whatever happened to the villagers, happened awful quick.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|A ledger… payment for a sack of grain… amount due for a charcoal shipment… Hendrik was masquerading as a merchant.
Geralt|Hm, what's this? Notes among the ledger entries - clever.
Geralt|Interesting headings…
Geralt|"Missing and Wanted." "Subject appeared in Skellige. Also sighted in Novigrad."
Geralt|"Appearance unchanged. Ashen hair. Scar on her face."
Geralt|"Avoids contact with others."
Geralt|"Drunken Swine." "So-called baron hosted subject at his castle, or should I say, illegally appropriated fort…"
Geralt|"Reason unknown."
Geralt|"Talk to baron at Crow's Perch."
Geralt|"Clashed with a Witch." "Subject landed in swamp, encountered a witch."
Geralt|"Conflict ensued. Cause unknown."
Geralt|"Find the witch."
Geralt|"Talk to the peasantry - village of Midcopse."
Geralt|"Caution Advised." "I'm being observed. Don't know by whom or why. Unsettling signs..."
Geralt|"Dog ran off."
Geralt|"Water in bucket froze solid."
Geralt|"Strange glow observed in the sky. Ill omen, peasants say."
Geralt|Somehow they learned Hendrik was looking for Ciri. Thus the torture…
Geralt|I'm too late. My only leads - the baron, and some witch.
Geralt|Damn.
<|endoftext|>
Baron Bandit Strong 01|You've got a young daughter, gramps. I know…
Verden Peasant 01|Search where ye will.
Baron Bandit Strong 01|One o' these days, you'll not hide 'er in time. Hear me? And you'll watch every lad in the unit shag 'er senseless.
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Strap on the loot! We're done 'ere!
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Bolo?!
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Bolo, what the fuck you doing?
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Move your arse, one of ye! Find out what the hell's goin' on in there!
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Find 'im! I want 'is head on a pike!
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Kill 'im!
<|endoftext|>
Baron|In Vizima - now those were balls!
Baron|Attended a few, me and my Annie!
Baron|Oh, how we danced! How we twirled! Hahaha!
Verden Woman 03|Ooh!
Baron|One, two, three - one, two, three - wayhey!
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|Enough.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|I don't care how you do it, but the deliveries must be weekly.
Baron|Won't you stay for tea?
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|No. Besides, you've another guest.
<|endoftext|>
Baron|Look at that - didn't even stay for tea.
Baron|In spite of all that blabberin' about how cultured the nation is…
Geralt|Rumors rarely find confirmation in reality - especially the ones about foreigners.
Baron|Heheh. Right you are.
Geralt|I'm…
Baron|I know who you are. Believe I also know why you've come.
Baron|We'll talk inside.
Baron|One thing - you'd do well to behave this time. Remember, I've still to decide what to do with you.
Baron|Which I shall do after we've spoken.
Baron|Ah-ha, our defender of the downtrodden. Greetings.
Geralt|News gets around quick.
Baron|That it does.
Baron|When I learned you'd slaughtered my men, I thought to have you captured and hanged. Or at least flogged.
Baron|But then I thought - one tough cocker if he bested that lot of cutthroats. Man like him could prove useful…
Geralt|I'm not a thug for hire.
Baron|I know who you are.
Baron|But since you come here having perpetrated that bloodbath, I assume you've something important to discuss.
Geralt|I do.
Baron|Very well, then let's discuss it.
Geralt|Useful? How?
Baron|That's the spirit! We'll work well together - I can see that already.
Baron|This way.
<|endoftext|>
Baron|Make yourself at home.
Baron|Now, where'd I put the bloody vodka…?
Baron|Ah, there it is! A snifter?
Geralt|Why not.
Baron|Hah! A man after me own heart. Hmm… with Foltest dead and Natalis' whereabouts unknown… bloody hell, who's a loyal Temerian to drink to these days?
Geralt|Himself and his company?
Baron|Good enough.
Baron|To the matter at hand - I'm Phillip Strenger, though the blobtits 'round here call me the Bloody Baron.
Geralt|Geralt of Rivia. Blobtits call me the Butcher of Blaviken.
Baron|I said already - I know who you are. Truth be told, it's the only reason we're talking.
Baron|How do you like it here in Velen?
Geralt|I don't.
Geralt|Swamps, bogs, marshes everywhere…
Baron|Exactly.
Baron|Someone loses their way 'round here, he becomes damn hard to find.
Geralt|What're you getting at?
Baron|Many have lost loved ones here. Some their wives, others their daughters…
Geralt|You know I'm looking for Ciri.
Baron|I do.
Baron|She showed up some time ago - exhausted, wounded, and stinkin' like a soaked hound after a hard hunt.
Baron|Later I learned she'd come from the swamp…
Geralt|Get to the point already.
Baron|Ciri. That's why you've come, isn't it?
Geralt|So she was here.
Geralt|What's that supposed to mean? That a threat?
Baron|Oi, not as clever as I suspected you'd be.
Baron|No, it's no threat. I'll spell it out for you - I know who you're looking for.
Geralt|Lovely place.
Geralt|Didn't come here to talk about the scenery.
Baron|You're wrong to avoid the topic. You've just arrived, plain to see. And the local swamps and bogs - they're interesting to say the least.
Baron|I know who you are. Truth be told, it's the only reason we're talking.
Geralt|No thanks. Didn't come here to drink.
Baron|Hmph. As you will. But I'll not sit here adry, if you don't mind.
Baron|Before the war, there was a distillery nearby, best in Velen. But the whoresons burnt it to the ground.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Baron home?
Baron Bandit Strong 03|Depends who's askin'.
Geralt|A witcher. Wanna talk to him.
Baron Bandit Strong 03|Hmph, yeah. And I wanna plough the lovely Queen Cerro.
Geralt|Gonna let me in or not?
Baron Bandit Weak 03|Eh, no passage for the likes of you.
Geralt|Seems to me we oughta be able to come to some sort of agreement.
Baron Bandit Strong 03|Hm, all right, in you go. But cause any trouble and we'll gut you faster than you can say "Nilfgaardian vendetta."
Baron Bandit Strong 03|Open the gate!
Baron Bandit Strong 03|Sergeant!
Baron Bandit Strong 03|Ardal! Witcher to see the baron!
Baron Bandit Strong 03|Don't want no disturbances, that clear?
Geralt|What do you think?
Geralt|Fine. Maybe another time.
Baron Bandit Weak 03|Seen this man before.
Baron Bandit Weak 03|Inn at the Crossroads. You bought us a round.
Baron Bandit Weak 03|As I recall, you were to go your separate way.
Geralt|It led me here. Gotta talk to the baron.
Baron Bandit Strong 03|Oh, aye? What about?
Geralt|Something important. His ears only.
Baron Bandit Weak 03|Fine. Lodrin, let 'im in.
Baron Bandit Weak 03|If he makes any trouble… well, we outnumber 'im.
Geralt|Right. Guess I'll be going.
Baron Bandit Weak 03|Inn at the Crossroads. You was there not so long ago.
Baron Bandit Weak 03|Thought you were supposed to go your separate way, nice and all.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Guard called you a sergeant. You a Temerian soldier?
Sergeant|Not your concern, mate.
Geralt|Deserter?
Sergeant|Temerian army don't exist no more.
Geralt|So what're you all doing here?
Sergeant|Had a choice after the Black Ones thrashed us - let it lie and try to lead normal lives…
Sergeant|…or continue to resist, join the guerillas and fight for our beloved Temeria till death do us part.
Sergeant|We chose the former.
Geralt|And the baron your commander?
Sergeant|Hmm, yeah - commander…
Sergeant|Oi, where the fuck are you going?!
Sergeant|Where'd you learn to twirl a sword like that?
Geralt|Someplace far away.
Sergeant|You know I can't let it lie.
Geralt|Don't think I care.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Greetings.
Verden Old Man 02|Greetin's to you.
Geralt|Other villagers all scurried off soon as they saw me. You didn't.
Verden Old Man 02|Oh, I-- I'm too old to scurry! Besides, what could you do to me?
Verden Old Man 02|Kill me? Go ahead - I've not long to live. Tan me hide? Wouldn't work - me skin's right brittle.
Geralt|Lived here long?
Verden Old Man 02|Hmm… erm… Since I was born. Reckon that'll be more than seventy winters!
Geralt|Must know the area well…
Verden Old Man 02|Not bad.
Geralt|Listen, I gotta get inside the fortress. Can I do that without going through the front gate?
Verden Old Man 02|Ye can, but few know the way.
Verden Old Man 02|If you were to make an 'umble offerin', call it, to this 'umble man, maybe I could point you in the right direction.
Geralt|Fine. Don't really feel like arguing with the guards.
Verden Old Man 02|Years back, when the old lord still ruled Crow's Perch, the blacksmith's boy went missing.
Verden Old Man 02|Whole village looked for him. No luck. Finally found the boy in the river - he'd drowned.
Geralt|Tragic. But how's that supposed to help me?
Verden Old Man 02|A few days on, an old woman who served the lord found the boy's cap near the castle well.
Geralt|So, either he lost it there, or he fell in the well.
Verden Old Man 02|Clever man. Village folk built a shrine where they found the lad's body. Northwest of here. Wager you'll find an entrance to a passage nearby…
Geralt|Shrine, where is it exactly?
Verden Old Man 02|Track that weaves through the village - follow it to the bridge. Turn right past that, then go on straight as piss till you get to a crossroads. Turn right again, then follow that path up a hill. Shrine stands upon it.
Geralt|Right past the bridge, then right again. I'll find it. Thanks.
Geralt|Won't finagle any coin out of me. If there's another way in, I'll find it.
Verden Old Man 02|Maybe you will, maybe you won't.
Geralt|Thanks, but think I'll manage on my own.
Verden Old Man 02|As you will.
Geralt|Just looking to make some coin, or is there another reason you're helping me?
Verden Old Man 02|What you did at the Crossroads - that's why they won't let you in, right?
Verden Old Man 02|The innkeep? My sister's husband.
Geralt|Take care.
Verden Old Man 02|Aye, you too. And fortune smile upon ye.
Verden Old Man 02|So? Change your mind? A bit o' coin and I'll tell you how to get in.
Verden Old Man 02|Ah, back again. Whaddaya need, my good man?
<|endoftext|>
Cirilla|Oof. That was close.
Cirilla|I must leave this place.
Cirilla|She needs help.
Verden Girl 02|What ye doin'?
Cirilla|Greasing my blade.
Cirilla|There. We'll see just how effective Uncle Vesemir's formulae are.
Cirilla|Hmm, massacred… by something with immense claws.
Cirilla|Wolf hairs. At this altitude? Strange.
Cirilla|All right. I have everything. Now for a spot where I can build a fire, brew the oil in peace.
Cirilla|Hm… Belly's all in blood. Clawed open. No wolves did this.
Cirilla|Hm, it's dead. But a pig here? Must be a human settlement nearby.
<|endoftext|>
Verden Girl 02|Wolves!
Cirilla|Quick! Hide!
Cirilla|You can come out now!
Verden Girl 02|My, you're brave. My father couldn't even do that!
Cirilla|Heh. Mine could do a lot more.
Cirilla|Come.
Verden Girl 02|Hear that? Wolves.
Cirilla|Hide, quickly!
Cirilla|They're gone! You can come out!
Verden Girl 02|You cut 'em up bad! The Wolf King will be angry.
Cirilla|Do parents often send their children out to follow the sweets?
Verden Girl 02|Sometimes they send their children, sometimes they go themselves.
Cirilla|Do they return?
Verden Girl 02|No, why would they? They've plenty to eat where the path ends.
Verden Girl 02|Look, there! Lindenvale!
Verden Girl 02|This way. Through the cave.
Cirilla|You lead.
Verden Girl 02|It's a bit dark…
Cirilla|Afraid?
Verden Girl 02|Are you?
Cirilla|No.
Verden Girl 02|Then I'm not either.
Verden Girl 02|Go away! Stupid wolves! Go!
<|endoftext|>
Verden Girl 02|What happened to you?
Cirilla|This? Hm, it's… nothing.
Cirilla choice|How is it you're here?
Cirilla|How did you wind up here?
Verden Girl 02|My father brought me. Told me to follow the trail of treats and eat my fill. He said he would wait.
Verden Girl 02|So I started down the trail, but then I saw a butterfly, and I ran to catch it, and I lost my way.
Cirilla choice|Remember how to get home?
Cirilla|You and your father - when did you leave home?
Verden Girl 02|This mornin'.
Cirilla|And did the sun warm your face or your back?
Verden Girl 02|It warmed my back.
Cirilla|So we must go east.
Cirilla|Come. I'll walk you home.
Cirilla|And explain to your parents that they must not lose their children in the woods.
Verden Girl 02|We can't go home. 'Cause of the Wolf King and his pack…
Cirilla choice|Don't be afraid. I'll protect you.
Cirilla|See what I've got on my back?
Cirilla|Wolves fear it. Kings do too.
Cirilla|Come, I'll help you up.
Verden Girl 02|Hrgh.
Cirilla choice|The Wolf King?
Cirilla|No kings among wolves.
Verden Girl 02|These have one!
Cirilla|And you've seen him?
Verden Girl 02|Yes! I mean, no. From behind a tree. He was huge, with giant eyes and great fangs, and he was terribly, disgustably horrific!
Cirilla choice|Why follow the trail of treats?
Cirilla|Your father - why did he have you follow the trail of treats? Do you know?
Verden Girl 02|Because… we had naught to break our fast with.
Cirilla|I don't understand.
Verden Girl 02|I was naughty… broke a jug… spilled all our milk.
Cirilla|Your parents must've been angry.
Verden Girl 02|Mother said I should be spanked, but father said 'twouldn't do no good - too many mouths to feed anyway.
Verden Girl 02|Sending me down the trail of treats - that would solve things.
Cirilla choice|Where do you live?
Cirilla|Why don't you tell me where you live.
Verden Girl 02|In Lindenvale. They'd see to your wounds there.
Cirilla choice|Good idea. I shall walk you home.
Cirilla|Hmm… not a bad idea.
Cirilla choice|How'd you get here?
Cirilla|You can come down!
Cirilla|Hello there. Are you lost?
Verden Girl 02|A little, I guess. Are you?
Cirilla choice|Yes, I'm lost, too.
Cirilla|Yes. Though also just a little.
Verden Girl 02|Does that mean… you know which way to go?
Cirilla|Not quite, not yet. But I'm sure we'll find the way if we set off together.
Cirilla choice|No. I never am.
Cirilla|I never lose my way.
Verden Girl 02|Mmm. If that's true, what are you doin' so deep in the forest alone?
Cirilla|Looking for lost little girls.
<|endoftext|>
Cirilla|Lips parted and bloated… Bit clear through his tongue.
Cirilla|Immense pain before death.
Cirilla choice|Summing up…    (unknown_condition)
Cirilla|Everything seems to suggest a fiend…
Verden Girl 02|What happened to him?
Cirilla|He… had a fall.
Verden Girl 02|Mhm, I bet. The Wolf King got him.
Cirilla|Hm, when did children get so smart?
Verden Girl 02|What'll we do when the Wolf King finds us?
Cirilla|Good question. I've no silver, but I can make a blade oil.
Verden Girl 02|Oil? You mean like we make from rapeseed?
Cirilla|No, a far more special oil.
Cirilla|Of dog tallow, fool's parsley, wolf's liver and mistletoe. The fiend will feel terrible, terrible pain…
Cirilla|Of dog tallow, wolfsbane, fool's parsley and wolf's liver. The Wolf King will feel terrible, terrible pain…
Cirilla|The Wolf King's no fantasy, it seems. Except, he's a werewolf.
Cirilla choice|Eyes.
Cirilla|Hmm… Bloodshot, but still moist. He died recently.
Cirilla choice|Head.
Cirilla choice|Chest.
Cirilla|Ah, his chest is crushed. Ribs probably pierced his lungs.
Cirilla|Something picked him up and threw him against the tree.
Cirilla choice|Leg.
Cirilla|Hmm… Something tore his leg off. No, gnawed it off.
Verden Girl 02|Eeew, that's horrible!
Cirilla|Stay there, and look away.
Cirilla|Hmm… What's this? Marrow's missing. Interesting.
Cirilla choice|Belly.
Cirilla|Let's see… Oh, his liver's gone.
Verden Girl 02|Why're you diggin' through his belly?
Cirilla|Would you mind making certain your laces are tied?
Cirilla|Wait here. Don't come any closer.
Verden Girl 02|But…
Cirilla|No buts. Stay here. I must see something.
Verden Girl 02|You're smart! How do you know these things? Did your father teach you?
Cirilla|Not my father. My uncle. Uncle Vesemir.
Verden Girl 02|Look! There's something there.
<|endoftext|>
Verden Peasant 02|Why… you really gave 'im a drubbin'! Never seen anythin' like it!
Cirilla|Girl! You can come out now! Come on!
Cirilla choice|We must get to the village.
Cirilla|You have bandages at home? Some spirit? He laid a claw or two on me, unfortunately.
Verden Peasant 02|I-I've naught, miss… but my lord - he's a powerful man. He's sure to help ye.
Verden Peasant 02|Might even reward you for cuttin' the werewolf down.
Cirilla|Very well. Lead us to your lord.
Cirilla choice|We found a corpse in the woods.
Cirilla|You're lucky we came this way. Found someone far less fortunate in the forest.
Verden Peasant 02|Oh, Yaren, must be. We was returnin' from Midcopse when the brute attacked. I managed to flee, but Yaren, er…
Cirilla|The little one - no details.
<|endoftext|>
Baron|So, stew any good?
Cirilla|Mhm, very, thank you. I'd not eaten in--
Baron|Clear to see. I'm pleased you like it. Had them prepare a bath for you, once you've eaten. And you could do with some sleep.
Baron|Gretka in the nook behind the hearth, you in the guest room opposite the kitchen.
Cirilla|Thank you. I--
Baron|Shh. Eat now. We'll speak once you've rested.
Baron|You'll not see one fucking copper!
Baron|Get out before I set my hounds on you!
Baron|Just who do you think you've brought me, man? That's not me daughter!
Verden Peasant 02|And the little one?
Baron|Neither, dammit! I think I'd know my own child.
Verden Peasant 02|Well, er… mi-might not be yours, the older one, but you've gotsta admit the likeness. It's downright strikin'! So, any chance for that reward?
<|endoftext|>
Baron|I propose an exchange - find my loved ones, and I shall tell you about the girl you seek. All I know.
Geralt|Huh, what if I refuse, 'cause I just don't want to?
Baron|Would you tell me to sod off? Go ahead. But then I'll tell you the same. And what'll that make us? Two helpless, empty-handed sods.
Baron|Think of it as searching for your own daughter. Ought to go quickly, then.
Baron|Guard! This man's under my protection. No one's to bother him - in any way.
Baron|Don't stare - I've not grown horns. Treat it as a token of my good faith.
Geralt|When'd you see them last?
Baron|They vanished after the new moon, as if whisked away by shadows.
Geralt|What do you mean, "vanished"?
Baron|Precisely that. I awoke one morn to find them gone.
Geralt|I'll need to know a lot more than that. Can I see their rooms?
Baron|What for?
Geralt|I need clues, anything to latch onto.
Baron|I'll not let a stranger paw through their belongings.
Geralt|Want me to find them or not?
Baron|I do.
Geralt|Then let me work.
Baron|Huh, fine. But I shall go with you. The doors are locked.
Geralt|You try to search for them?
Baron|Sent men out right away. But they're not suited to it. It's one thing to rip up floorboards in search of a peasant's last sack of grain. Finding a living person - they just don't know how.
Baron|Besides… Velen's naught but swamps and marshy woodland. Plenty of hard to find nooks. If you're lookin' to hide someone, this is the place.
Geralt|Maybe they were kidnapped. Got any enemies?
Baron|None worth mentioning. Worthless little pricks and angry peasants is all. None would dare raise a finger against my family.
Baron|Any who might've, they've been eating dirt long since.
Geralt|Anything unusual happen before they disappeared? They act differently, do anything strange?
Baron|Unusual? No… But not long ago, peasants came to complain that a beast had ravaged a woman by the well. Devoured another lass before her. Common occurrences in Velen.
Baron|And my women? Anna, quiet as a mouse, as ever. And Tamara, occupied with her… things… Nothing unusual.
Geralt|This place - must be hard to be the only two women here.
Baron|"This place"? What do you mean? They wanted for nothing here! Pheasant for dinner? Not a problem. Blue ribbons from Toussaint? Say the word.
Geralt|Had your men in mind, their company. Sure your wife and daughter weren't being harrassed?
Baron|My men are a horde of whoresons, but they know their place. One of them so much as looked at Anna or Tamara crosswise, I'd cut him down like a dog.
Geralt|Can't start searching till I know what they look like.
Baron|Tamara, my daughter, turned nineteen in the spring. Slender lass, about yea tall, comes up to my shoulders.
Baron|Beautiful eyes. Green like her mother's.
Baron|My wife, Anna, has two score winters behind her, though she'd never admit it.
Baron|Dark hair, thick as tar. Keeps it tied up in a bun.
Geralt|Fine. I'll help you. I'll find your family, but then you'll give me every bit of information you have.
Baron|You have my word.
Geralt|Thing is, can I trust you? What guarantees do I have?
Baron|Hahah! None whatsoever. Only my word.
Baron|So I ordered my men to watch her and left her to rest.
Geralt|And?
Baron|Ahhh, a topic for another time.
Geralt|Take it you won't give me this information for free.
Baron|Heheh, sharp you are.
Baron|I regret your loss, commiserate. But you see, it so happens my wife and daughter are missing as well.
Geralt|I want-- I need to find her, understand? I need every last bit of information available.
Baron|I understand. But you see, it so happens my wife and daughter are missing as well.
Geralt|No. A topic for now. Talk.
Baron|That sharpness - watch your tone, witcher.
Baron|We wish to come to an agreement, do we not?
Baron|Remember, you owe me. Butchered some of my better men.
Geralt|The little girl who showed up here with Ciri - what happened to her?
Baron|Gretka? She's safe and sound. Helps out in the kitchen.
Baron|Ciri told me of the girl's parents, what they'd decided. So I decided not to send the lass home.
Baron|She's fed here. A roof over a warm corner she calls her own. She wants for nothing.
Geralt|What happened to Ciri?
Baron|I've told you already - a topic for another time.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Hm? Damn ugly for a doll.
Geralt|The kind you'd stick with pins to hurt someone.
Geralt|An altar. So, the Eternal Fire's made it to Velen.
Geralt|Won't find much else here.
Geralt|The baron and his wife. Hm, look happy enough.
Geralt|What's this? Ah. Gotta wonder who wanted to hide the hole… and what's on the other side.
Geralt|Fresh flowers. He expects them to return any minute. Takes hope.
Geralt|Hmm… spruce wood. Smells of juniper incense. Some sort of folk talisman, protective.
Geralt|Question is - against what?
Geralt|Incense, and an old key. Wonder what it unlocks…
Geralt|Anise, sandalwood and something else… Saffron?
Geralt|Wall's a different color. Something used to hang here.
Geralt|Hm… that painting? Right size.
Geralt|Mangled bit of a candlestick. Someone smashed it against the wall and broke clear into the wardrobe.
Geralt|Getting interesting. Might be more traces of fighting. Gotta look around.
Geralt|Deep nicks. Hit with a heavy object.
Geralt|Huh, rest of the candlestick. And wine stains. Somebody smashed a bottle.
Geralt|From Toussaint. Yeah, Erveluce. Scent hasn't died. Wonder where it'll lead me.
Geralt|Damn, trail breaks off. Could find something else, though.
Geralt|Hmm, it gets interesting. Piece of wood looks like the stem of that candlestick. No coincidence there.
Geralt|Hmm… fight might've happened here. Oughta look for clues.
Geralt|Wooden candlestick. Stem's broken.
<|endoftext|>
Baron|Done pokin' around?
Geralt|Oughta have a chat with this pellar.
Baron|Fair warning - he's a hard man to talk to. Rumor has it he killed his own father with an axe as a lad, then went batty. Now they say he sees ghosts and ploughs his goat.
Geralt|Not really interested in his hobbies. Just want to ask about the amulet.
Geralt|Found a doll in Tamara's room. Tell me about it.
Baron|Heh! What could possibly be so interesting about a doll, witcher?
Geralt|Looks like it might've been used for some sort of black magic. Where'd Tamara get it?
Baron|Black magic? Are you barmy?! I made it for her!
Baron|She was four, perhaps five winters old. We were in Vizima on market day and she saw the sorceress Triss Merigold. Insisted she must have a doll just like her.
Baron|Couldn't afford a thing of that sort, so I made the doll with me own hands.
Geralt|So it is supposed to be Triss. Yeah, I see it now. Eerie. Looks just like her.
Baron|Doesn't it? Time's taken a bit of a toll, but overall, it continues to impress.
Geralt|You got something to fall back on if things don't work out with Nilfgaard.
Geralt|This is Triss? No offense, but uh… not great with your hands, are you?
Baron|Why don't you take some wood and rags, see what image of a grown woman you can come up with?
Geralt|Found signs of a fight in the room. Know anything about that?
Baron|A fight? What're you talkin' about?
Geralt|Someone was attacked - probably your wife or daughter. Whoever it was tried to defend themselves with a candlestick. Missed the attacker, punctured the wall, instead. They tussled, too.
Baron|I… I don't know nothin' about this. That night… I was drunk, don't remember a thing. They were gone by the time I awoke.
Geralt|Doubt you were the only ones in the castle. Maybe one of your men heard something?
Baron|Three times I asked those bastards if they'd seen anythin', heard anythin'. Nothin', not a one of 'em.
Geralt|Whole landing smells of wine. Tell me anything about that?
Baron|One of the lads, must be. Lushes one and all.
Geralt|Give your men Erveluce?
Baron|Oh, dammit, I might've spilled it. I told you I was good and marinated that night. Why's it matter? Stench of wine in plenty a corner around the castle.
Geralt|Recognize this amulet?
Baron|Hmm… Yes. Anna began wearing it a time ago.
Geralt|Any idea where she got it?
Baron|None.
Geralt|Any witches or cunning women in the area?
Baron|A pellar. Old coot lives near Blackbough. And there's a cunning woman in Midcopse, but I know little about her - she's only recently arrived.
Baron|If Anna were to see someone, she'd choose the pellar, not the woman. Anna was wary of strangers, newcomers.
Geralt|Hmm… can't help thinking I've missed something. Need to take another look.
Baron|Aim to look at the room or not?
<|endoftext|>
Baron Bandit Strong 01|What do you want?
Geralt|Wanna talk to the pellar.
Baron Bandit Strong 03|Too late. We've got dibs on a chat with 'im. A long one.
Geralt|What do you want from him?
Baron Bandit Strong 02|To give 'im what he deserves.
Geralt|And that is?
Baron Bandit Strong 01|He done conjured auguries. Said something evil had made its nest in Edric's bowels. Told Edric to eat rowanberries, lots of 'em!
Baron Bandit Strong 03|Ever since, Edric's lived in the outhouse, and he's got hardened pustules all over him!
Geralt|Just so happens I need the pellar alive. So if you agree to leave him alone, for good, I'm willing to tell you how to help Edric.
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Hmmm… well, all in all…
Geralt|Yes or no?
Baron Bandit Strong 02|Fine. Let's hear it.
Geralt|A tea of mullein leaves for his belly, and cover his boils with mallow. A few days and he'll be good as new.
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Noted. But if it don't work, we'll be back.
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Move out, boys!
Baron Bandit Strong 02|Who the 'ell do you think you are?
Geralt|A witcher.
Baron Bandit Strong 01|A witcher?
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Hear that, boys? Either Velen's got a bumper crop of witchers, or this is the bastard who cut down our boys at the Crossroads.
Geralt|Maybe we can make a deal.
Baron Bandit Strong 01|We'll not ploughin' bargain with no one. Vengeance, that's what we want!
Geralt|Think you need to leave now.
Baron Bandit Strong 02|Do we?
Geralt|You do.
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Well… let's go, then.
Geralt|Get the hell out. Now.
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Heheheh… And here I thought we'd have a day without corpses.
Baron Bandit Strong 02|Heard mages pay top coin for the special bits of rare creatures.
Baron Bandit Strong 02|Wonder 'ow much we'll get for his eyes.
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Arrrgh!
Baron Bandit Strong 02|Stand still, dammit!
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Any of yous know where this mullein shite grows?
Baron Bandit Weak 01|My old lady'll know. Got a knack for herbs, she does.
Baron Bandit Weak 01|The other shite, mallow, ought to have that, too. Chops it, adds it to our milker's feed.
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Heheheh, Edric's dumb as your milker. Should suit 'im.
Baron Bandit Strong 01|All right. Let's get Edric, pull 'im outta the shitter, stuff 'im full of herbs and see if he get's well.
Baron Bandit Weak 01|And if he don't?
Baron Bandit Strong 01|We'll visit the pellar one last time.
Baron Bandit Strong 01|We gotta go…
Baron Bandit Strong 02|Aye, we oughta…
Baron Bandit Weak 01|But where'll we go?
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Away from here…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Hm, gotta wonder about a man who could get Edric's friends all worked up.
Geralt|There you are…
Geralt|All right, time to try the bell.
Geralt|Come on. Let's go see the pellar.
Geralt|Should've guessed as much. What's a witcher compared to a patch of wild strawberries?
Geralt|Do I really have to keep ringing this bell for you to follow?
Geralt|Where the hell'd you go?
Geralt|Stupid fucking goat. Follow me. Need to stay closer to it.
Geralt|Come on. Where're you going?
Geralt|Could at least follow a goat path.
Geralt|It's slow, can't keep up with me. Gotta go back.
Geralt|Looks like I gotta go get Her Highness, 'cause Her Highness is not about to come to me.
Geralt|Come on, take you back to the pellar. Misses you something awful.
Geralt|This way, Your Grace.
Geralt|Come on, dammit!
Geralt|Bear! Bear! Run, you stupid piece of shit!
Geralt|You're no Roach, but I bet we could be friends in time.
Geralt|You've got that all-important quality every Roach has to have - you don't talk much.
Geralt|Bear prowled this area. Good thing I ran into him earlier.
Geralt|Here, goat! Ahem… Here, Princess!
Geralt|Hoofed and horned - shoulda known it would be stubborn.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Hey! Anybody home?
Geralt|Open up. It's safe now.
Guslar|Devils! Who do they bring?! What seek ye?
Geralt|I need your help.
Guslar|Ooh… a man - nay - a wolf, gray, though not old… 'Tis he the pellar awaits.
Geralt|Recognize this?
Geralt|Made of spruce wood, strong smell of juniper. Designed to protect someone.
Guslar|Freshly cut spruce sprinkled with goat's blood, then tempered with an incense of earthsmoke and juniper. For Anna. To protect her.
Geralt|Anna and her daughter are missing. Know where they are?
Guslar|Nay, no, nay. Pellar don't know.
Guslar|But the spirits could know. The pellar will augur, the spirits ask.
Geralt|Spirits, great, fine with me. Long as I know where to look, where to find them.
Guslar|Lost, lost… must be found… Princess! None better than Princess for findin' things.
Geralt|Princess? Which princess?
Guslar|Princess! My goat! She's fled!
Geralt|Those men must've scared her off. Can we get back to the auguring?
Guslar|Without the goat? Impossible. No goat? Hmph, won't work!
Geralt|Huh, will you help me if I bring the goat back?
Guslar|Princess, Princess, where've you got to, girl?
Geralt|Fine. I'll get your goat.
Guslar|The bell! The little bell's ringing - she loves it! Ring, ring, and she will follow! Uh, for a while.
Guslar|But beware of wild strawberries. Raspberries, too.
Geralt|Yeah, treacherous as beasts go. I always keep an eye out for 'em.
Geralt|Can't seriously think I'm gonna chase down your goat.
Guslar|A pellar without a goat makes for a mute prophet.
Geralt|Getting on my nerves, old man. I'm not going anywhere.
Guslar|No Princess, no prophecy, no augury.
Geralt|So, designed to protect her. From what?
Guslar|Oh, the dear - besieged, she was. Evil all around, wanting to possess her.
Guslar|Old magic born of oblivion, from dark sources emerged.
Geralt|Old magic? Can you be more specific?
Guslar|Tis naught for mouth-speech, nor for the touch. A small protective charm - not a thing more a pellar could do.
Geralt|You make the amulet?
Guslar|Aye. Sure, 'twas the pellar. After the way of his forefathers, over still water, in the light of a full moon.
Guslar|Proper as amulets go. It protected well. Should never 'ave taken it off.
Geralt|You were expecting me?
Guslar|Aye, as the bones declared I should.
Guslar|"They shall come whose stench is rape and death, but the wolf shall disperse them. The White Wolf."
Guslar|And thus he comes. Omens never lie.
Guslar|Nowhere in sight, nowhere to be found.
Guslar|Why, not even a White Wolf can make up for a missing goat.
Guslar|Goat of mine! Dearest, sweetest goat!
Geralt|Happy for you, but I'm kinda in a hurry.
Geralt|Anna and Tamara? They might be in danger.
Guslar|The White Wolf helped the pellar, and so the pellar shall help him!
Guslar|Blood! We need blood. A living being.
Geralt|Fine. Be right back.
Geralt|Will this do?
Guslar|They are not here. They have gone.
Guslar|Blood! I see blood!
Geralt|Whose?
Guslar|No Anna… no Tamara… just a child.
Guslar|A child that lives not, yet did not die.
Geralt|Mentioned a child. Whose?
Guslar|Why, Anna's.
Geralt|Anna was pregnant?
Guslar|She was. And she miscarried.
Geralt|Hm, baron didn't mention it.
Guslar|Afraid, perhaps, or ashamed, or forgetful… Or perhaps he had no wish to remember.
Geralt|What happened to the child?
Guslar|In a grave thrown, without rite or ceremony, it awoke. Now it wanders, it seeks vengeance.
Geralt|A botchling.
Guslar|White Wolf, wise wolf. Catch the botchling, the botchling will help, lead the wolf to the loved ones.
Geralt|Botchlings suck the blood of pregnant women and eat their fetuses. They don't help.
Guslar|Tis a being cursed, and witchers lift curses. If the White Wolf can't lift it, he should bring me its blood. Blood will always find kindred blood.
Geralt|Whatever I do, I gotta find the botchling first.
Guslar|Seek it at midnight, near the grave that lies empty.
Geralt|If what you say is true, the baron oughta know where that grave is.
Geralt|Why do you want its blood?
Guslar|Blood, blood, blood! It binds men for all ages - the living and the dead.
Geralt|Sure, but what do you wanna do with it?
Guslar|Atimes, a century's too short for two brothers to reconcile. One dies before things are set right. The other then brings his blood to the pellar.
Geralt|Mhm. And what does the pellar do?
Guslar|He awaits Forefathers' Eve. He mixes the blood with milk, herbs and hens' feet. He drinks - to reconcile the dead with the living.
Guslar|There shall be no Forefathers' Eve this year… but we'll find a way, all the same.
Geralt|Heard of one witcher who lifted a botchling's curse. Never tried it myself, though.
Geralt|I know you need to bury it under the threshold.
Guslar|And give it a name! Perform the Aymm Rhoin.
Geralt|The Ritual of Naming? That's an elven custom.
Guslar|Human, elven, dwarven… ancient. Spirits have no race, they honor not its meaning.
Guslar|Win a spirit's favor, and the spirit shall aid you. Ask and it will answer. Seek, and it will show you the way.
Geralt|I hear you right? You mention Forefathers' Eve?
Geralt|Pretty old custom. Thought it had died out.
Guslar|Death lurks in every bog and puddle 'round here. Folk know they could die, their earthly matters unresolved.
Guslar|Then they require help, or they'll not know peace. Forefathers' Eve must be performed.
Guslar|Light the tallow candles to lead them through the dark, call them by name, appease their regrets - only then may they depart in peace.
Geralt|The baron have anything to do with his wife's miscarriage?
Guslar|Foul-tempered he is, and he's a fondness for hooch.
Geralt|No doubt makes his temper even fouler.
Geralt|Did he abuse his family? Anna came to you, you must've noticed something.
Guslar|The pellar's old, near blind… but Princess came and licked her hand.
Geralt|So what?
Guslar|She's a wise beast, only comes to those who suffer.
Geralt|Anna tell you all this? Did she come here after it happened?
Guslar|Nay, not Anna. 'Twas the omens told me.
Geralt|Great, so I can be sure it's true.
Guslar|The omens need not your faith to be true, it is you who needs the omens to lead you to truth.
Geralt|It's over? Is that it?
Guslar|That is it.
Geralt|Spirits had nothing more to say? Like, where they went, or where they are now?
Guslar|You came for an augury, and augur I did. They're gone. The child remains.
Geralt|Can we talk about Anna and Tamara now? Know where they might be?
Guslar|Princess! Flee not from the pellar, for there are wolves about!
Guslar|Witcher! Will ye find my Princess? The pellar will prophesy soon as she returns.
Geralt|Forget it. Not about to run around looking for a goat.
<|endoftext|>
Baron|What're you starin' at? Get outta here, damned clots!
Baron|Wh-heeey! Come now! Who'll drink with me?!
Baron|Where the fuck is everybody?!
Baron|Now listen - this is how it was!
Baron|They told us not to shoot. I scaled the wall and gazed down on the fields to see two hundred ballistas thundering!
Baron|Not one fuckin' man here who knows how to celebrate!
Baron|Blargh. Just deserve, you ploughin' scumbags!
Baron|I know you're in there! Ugh, brgh!
Baron|Urgh. Open up, or I'll kill those brats of yours!
Baron|Ardal!
Baron|Where is Ardal?!
<|endoftext|>
Baron|I'd been soakin' myself three days straight. Anna came to me, said they were leaving. I begged them to stay. She refused to hear it.
Baron|I tried to stop her. She wriggled like an eel, we struggled… she fell.
Baron|Last blasted thing I remember. Woke up in the morn, breeches heavy with me own piss, a large bump on my head. Sadly, they were gone.
Baron|Know what that's like, witcher? No, how the fuck could you? I was left with nothing! Nothing! Only the bottle…
Geralt|What happened next?
Baron|Next… it only got worse. I awoke at sunset, not knowin' how many days had passed.
Baron|Thought it was all a ploughin' drunken nightmare. An' then I went to the bedchamber, but Anna was not there. Instead… there was blood, everywhere.
Baron|I knew. She'd miscarried. My breath short, my throat locked, I neared the bed… and saw it.
Baron|It lay there. A tiny thing, defenseless… on bloodied sheets… dead. And it was my doing.
Geralt|Maybe your doing, maybe not - but that amulet she wore could be important. Or maybe the fact that she lost it.
Geralt|What did you do with the child?
Baron|What was I to do? Took it out and buried it.
Geralt|Just like that?
Baron|Damn you! I gave no thought to a funeral. It was a horror, I wanted it to end.
Baron|That child had been my dream. I told Anna, "A little one, our little one, to make things right." Yet she died before she could be born.
Baron|Understand, witcher? My child was dead.
Geralt|Get hold of yourself. Men like you, when they break down, look downright pathetic.
Baron|You're a heartless bastard.
Geralt|Huh, mutations worked, then.
Geralt|But here's the good news - your dead child might help us find the one who's still alive… and your wife.
Baron|What? How?
Geralt|Sometimes miscarried fetuses, if they don't get a proper burial, turn into botchlings.
Baron|Into, fucking, what...?
Geralt|A cursed creature that draws strength from killing pregnant women. Once it's strong enough, it attacks those who scorned it.
Baron|But how… how does it know?
Geralt|Blood ties. They're a strong bond, a bond I want to use to find your family.
Baron|How?
Geralt|One of two ways. Legends claim you can bury a botchling under the family's threshold, perform a ritual and turn it into a lubberkin.
Geralt|That's a sort of, uhh… hob, a guardian spirit that could lead me to your family.
Baron|And the other way?
Geralt|We kill it and draw some blood. Take that to the pellar and he does the rest.
Baron|Do not kill my child. It's suffered enough already. Lift the curse, that it may finally rest in peace.
Geralt|Whatever we do, we gotta find the botchling first.
Baron|I'll show you where I buried her. And I'll dig the grave at my threshold.
Geralt|If it turns out we can't transform the botchling into a lubberkin, they can bury us in it. Handy either way.
Geralt|The sooner we resolve this, the better. Best do it tonight, at midnight.
Baron|Then wait here with me. Near midnight I'll take you to where I buried her.
Geralt|Get word to the common folk. Oughta stay in their homes tonight and draw a line of salt outside their doors.
Geralt|And try to sober up.
Baron|Do I take a shovel? To dig up the grave?
Geralt|Take it. You'll need it, but not for that.
Geralt|Need to tend to something first.
Baron|Be quick. And me? What am I to do in the meantime?
Geralt|Sober up.
Geralt|Still not sure what to do.
Baron|Whatever you decide, we must put an end to my child's suffering.
Geralt|Details you don't need to know. There's a bond of blood between this creature and your wife and daughter. I can use that bond to find them.
Geralt|I sympathize, I do.
Baron|Thank you. And know that I hope you find your Ciri.
Geralt|Deal we made means I need to find Tamara and Anna first. Just so happens your unborn daughter might help us do that.
Geralt|Seen a lot of dead in my time, but that must've been hard.
Baron|Unspeakably so. My legs gave out. Saw fields of corpses at Sodden… saw witches burn in Maribor…
Baron|But compared to this… all that was a rabbit's prick alongside a great oak. And the guilt is all mine.
Geralt|We don't know that yet. The amulet Anna wore - could be linked somehow. Maybe the fact that she lost it.
Geralt|What did you do with the child?
Baron|Wrapped it in a clean sheet and buried it.
Geralt|Signs of a fight in the room - hole in the wall, wine all over the landing. Was that you?
Baron|Aye. We tussled… She tried to whack me on the noggin with a candlestick, but kept missin'. Hit the wall and the pillar instead.
Baron|I staggered backwards onto the table. Spilled the wine, slipped and tumbled.
Baron|Anna used that moment to flee. She rushed down the stairs, still clutchin' that damn candlestick.
Baron|I caught her on the landin'. We fell, I-- I thought I had her… then she turned and smacked me in the head.
Baron|I blacked out, don't know what happened next. When I came to, I was alone.
Geralt|Tamara present for all this? She see you quarrel?
Baron|Through the doorway, perhaps. She didn't enter the room. Shame, too - things might've turned out differently.
Baron|The sight of her always calmed me.
Baron|Well? Ready?
Geralt|I know your wife miscarried. Was that before or after you beat her to a pulp?
Baron|What the fuck're you suggesting?!
Geralt|Don't play me for a fool. You'd been beating them for years. Finally, they'd had enough and fled. Sound about right?
Baron|Aaarrrrggghhh…
Baron|Are you outta your fuckin' mind?!
Baron|You, you… where do I know you from, eh?
Baron|Ah, right! The witcher! Come, drink with me! Pale as a ghost, you are!
Geralt|They ran from you, didn't they?
Baron|Lying prick!
Baron|Hahahahaah! We've a hero in our midst!
Baron|You've earned yourself a barrel of Lyrian!
Baron|The horses! Why, I'm prepared to forgive you the drubbin' you gave those pricks at the Crossroads!
Geralt|Sit down.
Geralt|You beat them.
Baron|I never laid a finger on Tamara, not once.
Geralt|And on Anna?
Baron|That's another story.
Baron|She always knew how to spark my ire.
Geralt|You knew they had run away from the start.
Baron|Yes, I knew.
Geralt|Why didn't you tell me? Wasted my time.
Baron|Say I had? Say I'd said I had troubles, couldn't control my wife, my daughter? What kind of flaccid prick would you take me for?
Geralt|Tell me everything you remember about the day they fled. The truth this time.
Geralt|Gotta admit I do think you're a prick. Not because you couldn't control them, but because you drove them away.
Baron|What?
Geralt|Don't play the idiot. You gave them no choice.
Baron|Anna… and I… It wasn't as it seemed, seems…
Geralt|All right, I'm all ears. Tell me what happened. The truth this time.
Geralt|Don't much care what you have to say.
Geralt|I'm supposed to find your family, and I will. With your dead baby's help.
Geralt|Doesn't much matter now. I know how to find them.
Baron|How?
Geralt|I know about the baby.
Geralt|Your wife - how'd she make you angry? Too much salt in the soup? Socks never darned?
Baron|Twenty years we've known each other. She's seen me drunk and sober, she was there to greet me when I returned the victor, she was there to patch me up in defeat.
Baron|Like no other, she knew where to press, where to pinch, so it would hurt.
Geralt|You beat her? For that? For criticizing you?
Baron|Argh, witcher, you haven't a clue, have you. Well, perhaps I shall tell you about it one day. One day, but not today.
Geralt|Expect me to believe you were a loving father to Tamara? After that scene in the courtyard?
Baron|You're free to believe whatever you wish, but she was always the apple of my eye. She had the run of the place, ask anyone.
Baron|She'd ride the horses, hunt with the men, at times join them on their rounds. And they'd send for her when I flew into a rage, for only she could calm me.
Geralt|Make it sound like she led a charmed life. If that's the case, why'd she run?
Baron|I'd hardly need you if I knew.
Geralt|I'll try to lift the curse. No promises, though. Story of the transformation could be nothing but wives' tales.
Baron|We must try. They say every legend holds a grain of truth.
Geralt|Not gonna play around with folk rituals. Rather kill it, let the pellar do the rest.
Baron|Don't be rash. Make sure it's the only way.
Geralt|We need to talk.
<|endoftext|>
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Oswin! Where's Oswin?!
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Anyone seen him?
Baron Bandit Strong 03|Believe I saw him headin' to the stable.
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Whaat?!
Geralt|Fire! You blind? Nobody willing to put it out?
Baron Bandit Strong 03|Ain't that simple. Most're afraid! Baron flies into a rage, he takes no prisoners!
Baron Bandit Strong 01|My brother's in the stable! We've got to save him - he'll burn alive! Him and the horses!
Geralt|See what I can do.
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Hurry, now! Quick!
Geralt|Somebody oughta see to the baron before he burns the castle down.
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Oswin! My brother! He's still in the stables! Save him!
<|endoftext|>
Baron Bandit Weak 03|Over here! Can't get out! Roof's collapsed!
Geralt|Coming to get you!
Baron Bandit Weak 03|Akh akh. Horses! Gotta let 'em out! Open the main door!
Baron Bandit Weak 03|Remember me?
Geralt|Stable hand. Pulled you out of the fire.
Baron Bandit Weak 03|Won't ever forget that. Here, I'm grateful.
Baron Bandit Weak 03|Thanks, mate.Akh… You saved my sorry arse. Thought I'd roast for sure.
Baron Bandit Weak 03|Akh akh… Help me! Akh. Do somethin'!
Baron Bandit Weak 03|Door! Akh akh… Open the door!
Baron Bandit Weak 03|Good work!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Chose a lovely spot.
Baron|Dammit, will you relent? I ploughin' know I've done wrong.
Geralt|Good.
Geralt|The grave's dug up. And empty.
Baron|What's that mean?
Geralt|Botchling's on the prowl.
Baron|Look!
Geralt|Get back!
Geralt|Take it in your arms, quick!
Baron|And if it goes garrity?! It'll bite us in the arse before we know it!
Geralt|Keep screaming and it will turn rabid. It's calm, for now.
Baron|Bloody hell. What happens when it gets ploughin' restless?
Geralt|It'll bite through your jugular, and you'll bleed to death before I can help. Tell me if it starts wriggling - I'll calm it with magic.
Geralt|Pick it up. Take it in your arms.
Baron|Merciful gods!
<|endoftext|>
Baron|Bloody hell! You killed my child!
Geralt|You know I had to.
Baron|You were supposed to lift the curse! Save it, damn you! Not kill it!
Geralt|Shut up before you wake someone. Last thing we need is a crowd.
Baron|Fuck it! I don't ploughin' care, hear me?! You killed my child!
Geralt|I killed a botchling. Your daughter died a while back.
Geralt|Go home. Get yourself together. I'll try to find your other daughter - the one who's still alive.
Baron|What… what will you do with that blood?
Geralt|Me? Nothing. Just hope the pellar knows what to do with it. Go home. I'll come see you once I know something.
Geralt|Do anything stupid, and I'll kill you, too.
Baron|Go plough yourself! Kill me if you must. I've nothin' to live for anyway.
Geralt|You've got another daughter… and a wife. And the botchling's blood will help me find them.
Geralt|Forgive me. It couldn't be avoided. I truly am sorry.
Baron|Yeah, sure! Like hell, you're sorry!
Geralt|Calm down. Go home. With a bit of luck I'll be back soon with news of your family.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Yeah, don't see any sense in waiting.
Guslar|So shall it be.
Geralt|Gimme a bit. Gotta get ready.
Guslar|The pellar shall await you here.
Geralt|Ready. Time for the ritual.
Guslar|Let's begin.
Guslar|Remember to protect the flame, or we'll be lost.
Geralt|I'll remember.
Geralt|All right, let's see if these old rituals hold any sway in these foul times.
Guslar|You wish to go right away?
Geralt|So, how will this ritual work?
Guslar|A decoction the pellar shall brew, and when midnight tolls, off we go, to the sacred ground in the woods.
Geralt|Mhm… We gonna need black candles?
Guslar|"Step onto the paths of blood anight, standing upon bare ground, facing the old gods." 'Tis not unlike Forefathers' Eve.
Geralt|All right. What then?
Guslar|The pellar shall summon the spiritling, the babe's ghost, and it shall be our guide. And then… then you shall see something few these days witness.
Geralt|Can I help? Bring any other ingredients?
Guslar|Hmm-hmm… Henbane… yes. Jimsonweed… aye. And lungwort. Ah, here's the lungwort.
Guslar|Milk, why, Princess shall provide, and a pellar's always got hen's feet. But, but… Eau-de-vie, fear that's all gone.
Guslar|Ah! There's some hooch left! Do just fine. So, that's everything.
Geralt|Got the botchling's blood. Know what to do? How to find Anna and Tamara?
Guslar|Blood, blood, blood… The pellar knows, knows the ritual, ritual to summon the spirits. The pellar will take the blood.
<|endoftext|>
Guslar|Nearly there, nearly there…
Geralt|What is this place?
Guslar|Shh… the Wolven Glade.
Geralt|Nice name. White Wolf should feel right at home.
Guslar|The White Wolf - aye, good balance, for terrible things happened here of yore.
Guslar|To this day, none dare mention the name aloud.
Guslar|Here. The place.
Geralt|What now?
Guslar|Light the fires.
Geralt|All right, no reason to dawdle.
Guslar|Prepare, and prepare well. Once the spirits appear, there'll be no recourse, no turning back.
Geralt|Nothing like a little encouragement…
Guslar|Light the fires. The pellar will treat that as his sign to begin.
Geralt|The fires - why do we need them?
Guslar|To keep malicious forces at bay. You must watch they do not go out! Or else, it shall come!
Geralt|What'll come?
Guslar|Evil.
Geralt|What about you? What'll you do?
Guslar|The pellar must clear the stone, then draw the signs.
Guslar|Then to the gods shall the pellar pray, that no evil may take us.
<|endoftext|>
Guslar|The White Wolf must follow the pellar. The pellar will show the way.
Geralt|We got a long way to go?
Guslar|Nay, it's not far. Through the village, then the wood, and there we will be.
Guslar|The White Wolf must follow.
Guslar|Tis not far now.
Geralt|All this the baron's land?
Guslar|Tis now. 'Twere not before.
Geralt|So who'd it belong to?
Guslar|To the lord. Vserad they called him.
Guslar|An evil man he were. Vile, cared not a lick for common folk.
Geralt|You all get together and drive him away?
Guslar|When the Black Ones came, the lord to the tower on Fyke Isle fled.
Guslar|The invaders set the fields afire, and a great hunger descended on us all.
Guslar|While the lord in abundance wallowed, there in the Tower of Mice.
Guslar|But the old gods in their ire upon him visited a punishment.
Guslar|A plague of rodents swarmed the isle.
Guslar|At first they ate all from the feast tables. Then, the lord and all his court they devoured.
Geralt|Local gods just aren't known to be tolerant.
Geralt|Nilfgaardians hit you pretty hard.
Guslar|Folk're poor here. It's rare the mighty concern themselves with the poor.
Guslar|But the invaders'll be punished, that's sure.
Guslar|Perchance they've already been.
Geralt|How's that?
Guslar|A pestilence grips their camp and will devour them all. As the mice devoured the lord's court.
<|endoftext|>
Guslar|By the powers of earth and sky! By the world that was to be your home…
Guslar|I, who have tasted your blood, summon you to guide me!
Guslar|Come, Blood Unborn!
Guslar|Come, Blood Spurned!
Guslar|Come, Blood Never Named!
Guslar|Hear me upon the paths! Lead me along the trail of those bound to you by blood!
Guslar|The blood calls.
Guslar|"I'm leaving, Phillip, Tamara's coming with me!" I see a face swollen, pulsing with blood.
Guslar|Blood! Dark upon a pale visage! A drop trickles over bright gold.
Guslar|I am a fist clasped… I am darkened blood beneath a white nail…
Guslar|I am a tear of blood.
Guslar|I see the blood of her blood! I see them bound!
Guslar|The blood summons me…
Guslar|A thick flow upon skin! Dark blood upon a light stone!
Guslar|I am the Unnamed! I am blood immersed in blood!
Guslar|I… I am dead!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|You all right?
Guslar|Akh akh akh… Y-yes akh…
Geralt|Is it over?
Guslar|It's done. The pellar's seen what he was meant to see.
Geralt|This Voytek from your vision - know him?
Guslar|Voytek… Voytek… Two Voyteks have we nearabouts.
Guslar|In Blackbough lives one. In his hut, there he stays, has for years. Gophers, with gophers he lives, they say. And he can remember a time when in these lands dwelled only elves.
Geralt|And the other? Somehow I doubt they went to a century-old rodent lover for help.
Guslar|A fisherman. A family he has, lives in a secluded hut near the river's mouth.
Geralt|Time I was on my way. Thanks for your help.
Guslar|Refuse? Why, the pellar could never have refused.
Guslar|A man seeks to do good in life, but evil is unavoidable. The ones who encounter evil, why, they must be helped.
Guslar|Fare thee well, and may the gods bless and keep you.
Geralt|You don't look like you can get home on your own. I'll walk you.
Guslar|Thank you.
Geralt|No. Thank you for your help. Let's go.
Geralt|Third vision seems most important.
Guslar|Hm, they were walking through the woods, both weak, but for different reasons. Yet both knew where they were agoing.
Geralt|Not sure I heard you right, but you mention a Voytek?
Guslar|Hope filled both their hearts at the thought of him.
Geralt|Hm. And the prophecy at the end? Ithlinne's words, you quoted them, and then asked me a question.
Guslar|Forgive the pellar, he knows not what you mean. Spirits, the spirits speak through the ritual, not he.
Geralt|Didn't fully understand what the second vision was about.
Guslar|Anna miscarried, blood everywhere. Suffering, the pellar felt it on her. She died her daughter's death.
Geralt|What did you see first?
Guslar|The pellar saw the baron and Missus Anna. They quarreled, he did not wish for her to leave. He shook her, but the pellar sensed no anger in him…
Guslar|He wounded her, and in the blood the pellar sensed love. A love sad and tormented.
Guslar|Show me the blood that is your blood. Show me the blood that is lost.
Guslar|The blood summons me!
Guslar|"Just a bit further, mum, hold on!" The blood leaves her face.
Guslar|Thorny boughs snag her, stop her… I am a drop on a web.
Guslar|"Will Voytek wait?" Dark blood carries the question downriver.
Guslar|Why do you seek the child of Elder Blood?
Guslar|Nigh is the Time of the White Frost and White Light, the Time of Madness and Disdain.
Guslar|The world shall perish amidst ice and be reborn of Elder Blood, of a planted seed.
Guslar|What can you possibly offer?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Just need information. Looking for two women - the Bloody Baron's wife and daughter.
Verden Peasant 05|Not a soul abeen here, sir.
Geralt|Sure? Not even passing through? Daughter's medium height, about twenty, her mother's thin, about forty. Seen them?
Verden Boy 01|That's her came at night, right, mummy?
Verden Woman 01|Quiet, boy!
Geralt|What happened to Tamara's mother?
Verden Peasant 05|Ach. 'Twere like this - I was awaitin' in the old smokehouse, with horses. Cold as hell and so dark, couldn't see past two ells in front of ye.
Verden Peasant 05|Moon 'ad arisen high, and still they hadn't come. Began to fear some demon 'ad snatched 'em. But finally they came forth, and we sets off towards the river.
Verden Peasant 05|Suddenly, out of nowhere a gale arose. Thought it'd tear my head off! And those damned birds! Swarms of 'em coursin' o'er the woods, raisin' a racket to make your ears bleed!
Verden Peasant 05|Missus Anna screamed, bent over into herself. Tamara knelt down, gripped her arms. 'Twere then I saw it - fiery marks on her hands.
Geralt|What marks?
Verden Peasant 05|They's… well… like burned on with hot iron… on the palms, inside.
Geralt|Burned? Like a cattle brand?
Verden Peasant 05|Aye, though these wasn't black scars, scabbed over. They's hot and glowin' as if they burned with raw fire.
Geralt|While back I met a woman in Crookback Bog. Had fiery marks on her skin like the ones you described.
Verden Peasant 05|Must be her! Missus Anna! Gods… she to Crookback Bog…
Geralt|It's where I saw her last.
Verden Peasant 05|Gods of all the heavens protect us… 'Tis clear now whose whisper 'twere in the night.
Geralt|It is?
Verden Peasant 05|The Crones took her! She must've made a deal with 'em, a pact! It's why they marked her and took her like she was their own.
Geralt|Fine, what happened next?
Verden Peasant 05|Grew even darker, seemed someone 'ad put out the stars. Crickets all went silent of a sudden, and then, from the woods, a roar.
Verden Peasant 05|Broke out in a cold sweat, and before I could catch my breath a beast jumped out o' the woods - big as a barn, with horns and two burning coals for eyes!
Verden Peasant 05|I thought I was done for! Beast attacked Missus Anna's horse, ripped its head off! Carried her off into the woods!
Verden Peasant 05|Our horses, mine and Miss Tamara's, got spooked and tore off willy-nilly. 'Twere the only reason we escaped!
Verden Peasant 05|The miss wanted to go back for her mother, but my wife pleaded, said she'd die out there alone. Miss Tamara agreed not to go.
Geralt|Why help them at all? You risked a lot.
Verden Peasant 05|I'd a debt, owed Miss Tamara. Three moons past a fever gripped my boy. We thought he was done for.
Verden Peasant 05|Tamara learnt it, brought food and salves. We're poorer than dirt itself… She saved my boy, no two ways about it.
Verden Peasant 05|Me, myself, I'd a never dared to help. But my missus told me, "A time of war and contempt's come, a time of folk gone wrong. We needs to repay good with good. Who stands by idly does evil as if."
Geralt|Married a wise woman.
Verden Peasant 05|Cryin' shame we couldn't save Missus Anna in the end.
Geralt|Thanks for your help.
Verden Boy 01|The lady - she'll be all right in the end, won't she?
Geralt|I'll do what I can to see that she is.
Geralt|Where'd the girl go? Your son's said enough, no point in playing dumb anymore.
Verden Peasant 05|Sorry, sir, but ye don't look like one of her father's men.
Geralt|Because I'm not. I'm looking for Tamara and her mother, I need to know if they're alive and safe.
Verden Peasant 05|Tamara is, aye. She's to my brother's place in Oxenfurt. But Missus Anna - that's another tale…
Verden Peasant 05|Though anywhere's better than to Crow's Perch… with the baron.
Geralt|Why?
Verden Peasant 05|Cause… 'cause he beat her, sir. Beat Missus Anna, I means. Everyone knew! But not a one lifted a finger for to stop it.
Geralt|I want to help that woman. She could be in danger.
Verden Woman 01|Young 'un's seen no one, m'lord. He's a kiddie, must 'ave dreamt it.
Geralt|I wanna hear this dream, then.
Geralt|So, kid, who did you see? Who came here?
Verden Boy 01|Pappy brought 'er at night, the lady does the medicines. She was all afeared. Talked about an awful monster, said she had to go back. Don't know where to.
Verden Boy 01|Mummy and pappy cheered 'er up, gave 'er clothes. Hers were ragged.
Verden Boy 01|The pretty young one, does the medicines - she came that night. She was tired, breathin' hard. Mummy gave her something to drink.
Geralt|No need to be afraid, little guy. I'm not gonna hurt you. Which woman was it - older or younger?
Geralt|Tell me everything you remember.
Verden Boy 01|Who's that?
Verden Woman 01|Other room. Go on, now.
Verden Peasant 05|What ye seek here, sir? Our hut's out of the way, woeful. We 'as nothin', we knows nothin'.
Geralt|They call you Voytek?
Verden Peasant 05|I… I… They do, kind sir, but I's not done a thing. Swear it on the lives of my young 'uns!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Back to the fortress.
Baron|What? With this?
Geralt|As I recall, you were the one wanted to test the old legends, change it into a lubberkin.
Baron|Oh fuck…
Baron|But… but what do you want to do with it?
Geralt|Me? Nothing. This is your job. Told you, gotta bury it under the threshold. If the tales are true, by tomorrow it'll be a lubberkin.
Geralt|From then on it'll watch over your house, and help me find your family.
Geralt|Hungry specters. Botchling's scent attracted them.
Baron|On my mother's grave… Do something!
Geralt|More coming. Need to hurry.
Baron|On with it! I'll not wait till they devour us!
<|endoftext|>
Baron|What now?
Geralt|Repeat after me.
Geralt|By the powers of earth and sky.
Baron|By the powers of earth and sky.
Geralt|By the world that was to be your home.
Baron|By the world that was to be your home.
Geralt|Forgive me, you who came but who I did not embrace.
Baron|Forgive me, you who came but who I did not embrace.
Geralt|I name thee - say her name - and embrace thee as my daughter.
Baron|I name thee Dea and embrace thee as my daughter.
Geralt|Good. Now bury the body.
Baron|Agh. What now?
Geralt|In one day's time Dea should turn into a lubberkin.
Geralt|I'll stay here and wait. You go home.
Baron|I'll wait with you.
Geralt|Out of the question.
Baron|But… that's my child. And the guilt, the responsibility for all this lies with me.
Geralt|Time for parental impulses… it's long past. Besides, nothing else you can do here.
Baron|But--
Geralt|No "buts." Just witcher's work left to do here. Gotta wait a day and a night for the botchling to turn into a lubberkin. That's it.
Geralt|Go home. And try not to drink yourself stupid again.
<|endoftext|>
Tamara|You're looking for me. And who might you be? My father send you?
Geralt|Yeah. To see if you're still alive. And well. I'm Geralt of Rivia.
Tamara|I'm quite alive and extraordinarily well, Geralt of Rivia. Better than I've ever been in this rotten life of mine. And now that you've seen me, I bid you farewell.
Geralt|Wait…
Tamara|We've nothing more to talk about.
Geralt|Got every right to be angry at your father, but he's worried about you.
Tamara|I have a right? Thank you kindly. So good to have the approval of his hired thug! And my father worries only about what to get soused on next.
Geralt|He's no saint, that's clear. But he's got the whole province on its feet, looking for you.
Geralt|Finding you and your mother - seems to me there's nothing more important to him now. I know evil men. He's not one of them.
Tamara|Shame he never showed such concern before. Especially for my mother.
Geralt|He made a mistake and knows that. I'm not defending him, just saying that maybe he's come to realize what he's done. And what you mean to him.
Tamara|Oh wonderful, I'll bear that in mind. Did you really come all the way here just to tell me that?
Geralt|What will you do now?
Tamara|Find my mum.
Geralt|You realize that might not be that easy.
Tamara|Don't worry, I'm not daft enough to believe I can do it alone. I've got some new friends now. Powerful friends. They'll help me.
Geralt|Who are these friends? If it's not a secret.
Tamara|No secret. Heard of the Church of the Eternal Fire? A priest helped me contact the Redanian witch hunters. Righteous, brave men. They'll help me.
Graden|Well, well… a witcher. Never thought the baron would stoop to hiring a monster slayer. Though I hear you're good at tracking things down.
Geralt|Where are you gonna take her?
Graden|Tamara must rest. She's had a harrowing experience. When the warmth of the Eternal Fire has restored her strength, we shall see about finding her mother.
<|endoftext|>
Sergeant|That night when the baron ordered everyone to lock their doors, stay inside - what did you and the baron do?
Geralt|Gotta ask the baron about that. Speaking of which, know where he is?
Sergeant|Garden. Spends a lot of time sittin' there of late.
Geralt|Drunk.
Sergeant|No. Don't drink, don't eat… just sits.
Sergeant|Witcher - a word, please.
Sergeant|Believe we've not had the pleasure. They call me the sergeant. Leftover from my army days, you understand.
Sergeant|When me and Phillip, meanin' the baron, served under a Temerian banner. Wanted to ask you about somethin'.
Geralt|What is it?
Geralt|No time.
Sergeant|This'll only take a minute.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|There you are.
Baron|See the hollyhock there? The violet blooms? Brought the plants here from Nazair.
Baron|Anna had read some story. Insisted on having them. Spent hours tending to them, trimming, pruning. She was so content at that!
Baron|And them - the frilly ones? Called "birds of paradise" in Zerrikania. But Tamara called them "dragons of paradise." She adored them.
Baron|I'll never know which blooms would please my second daughter most. Damn shame…
Geralt|She brought death down on others. The sooner you start thinking of it that way, the better off you'll be.
Baron|Can't deny that. Doesn't make it any easier to live with, though.
Geralt|Got some information about your family.
Baron|You've learned something?
Baron|Let's go inside. It's a bit chilly out.
Geralt|Your loss - it must hurt, bad. But there wasn't anything we could do.
Baron|No, not now, not anymore. It was too late, that was clear…
Baron|Shoulda acted earlier, taken them all from this damned Velen.
Baron|In this hole, this reasty mire… nothing could go right here.
Baron|Damn shame I'll never learn which blooms would please Dea most. Though it's good to know her spirit's free.
Baron|It's grown cold. Come, we'll talk inside.
<|endoftext|>
Baron|Ciri! Come! Whole haunch should be yours, as I see it!
Sergeant|Aye, you done well, lass.
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Not bad, not bad at all, but who goes boar huntin' with a sword?
Cirilla|No bow at hand, no spear. My sword was all I had.
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Heheheh. Well, you brandished it beautifully. Where'd they teach you that, anyway?
Cirilla choice|At Kaer Morhen.
Cirilla|At Kaer Morhen.
Baron Bandit Weak 01|Witchers' school there, aye. But they only took lads, as I recall.
Cirilla choice|I'm the exception.
Cirilla|They made an exception for me.
Baron Bandit Strong 02|Right. Mean to say you're a she-witcher?
Cirilla|Not entirely. The mutations - I was never subjected to them. But everything else I know, I learned from the witchers there.
Baron Bandit Weak 02|Know any of them potions?
Cirilla|Not so much. A bit.
Baron Bandit Weak 02|Cause you see, atimes I get this pinchin' back here…
Baron Bandit Strong 02|Shut it, Ygrin. Nobody cares about your backside!
Baron Bandit Strong 02|A woman could swing a sword - I've knowed one. But never seen a lady mount anythin' but a cock proper. All tipsy on 'orseback. Nothin' strange on account they bloody mount them sideways.
Cirilla|Perhaps you'd care to wager?
Baron Bandit Strong 02|Think you can outrun me on an 'orse? Hahahah, naturally! What's the stake?
Cirilla|Black mare. The one in the stable.
Baron Bandit Strong 02|Oh, that won't do at all…
Cirilla choice|Coward?
Cirilla|What happened? You get the jitters?
Baron Bandit Strong 02|No.
Cirilla|Hahaha. So why not?
Baron|The horse is mine.
Cirilla|To race the baron himself - I'd consider it an honor.
Sergeant|Oh-oh! That'd be a sight to behold!
Baron Bandit Weak 01|Would it ever!
Baron|Done. But if I win, I take your sword.
Cirilla|Agreed.
Baron|I'd not drink anymore this night. You'll want your head about you. We start at daybreak.
Cirilla choice|What's the problem?
Cirilla|Well that's an awfully gloomy face.
Cirilla|Too much of a coward to race a woman?!
Cirilla choice|I'm not a witcher.
Cirilla|I'm not a witcher. Just grew up there.
Baron Bandit Weak 02|I believe it, seein' how you swing that sword.
Cirilla choice|On the road.
Cirilla|Mh. A little here, a little there…
Baron Bandit Weak 01|Not surprising given you wander the world alone.
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Not alone no more! She's in the company now!
Baron Bandit Weak 02|That's right! You're a member of the company! We're drinkin' together, killed a wild boar as a pack, you might say, but we've no notion how you arrived here.
Baron Bandit Weak 02|A woman in a man's garb, razor on her back… Who exactly are you? You a mercenary?
Cirilla choice|Something of the sort.
Cirilla|Let's say I go about my business, and when there's coin to be earned, I don't readily turn it down.
Baron Bandit Weak 01|I've always 'eld - with the world 'ow it is today, lasses ought to know 'ow to fend for theirselves.
Baron Bandit Strong 02|All right, all right.
Cirilla choice|I'm a witcher.
Cirilla|Mm, a witcher - though, not entirely. I never went through the mutations.
Baron Bandit Weak 02|A witcher? So, apart from the swordplay, what, you know potions and all that?
Cirilla choice|Just a traveler.
Cirilla|I just travel a lot. And I don't always happen upon such good and civil company.
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Aaaah, gift of the gab, she's got! Here's to good company!
Sergeant|This I like! Drinks like a lad, knows her sword work, kills a boar as if it were a piglet! A she-wolf, if ever I've seen one!
Baron|That lass of yours - pure luck in the flesh. To hunt down a wild boar that size - why, worthy of one of King Foltest's feasts, were he still among the living.
<|endoftext|>
Baron|You're wind, not woman!
Baron|Worthy of the best horse! The mare is yours!
Cirilla|Thank you!
Baron|What?
Cirilla|Another chance to win.
Cirilla|Dammit! By a hair!
Baron|See that? Not nearly as haggard as you think me!
Cirilla|Congratulations.
Baron|Unnecessary. Better you bid your sword farewell. I await my reward!
Baron|Haha-hahahaah!
Cirilla|Aaaaa!
<|endoftext|>
Cirilla|You helped me as well - when your man brought me here. You fed me, cared for me, had my wounds looked after.
Cirilla|We're even now.
Baron|You needn't leave. You're in good company here. We'll always have a warm corner for you.
Cirilla|I must leave.
Cirilla|Wraiths pursue me. The Wild Hunt. I was foolish to use the Power. They're sure to have caught my scent.
Baron|The Wild Hunt? Pursuing you?
Cirilla|I'll endanger all of you by remaining here. You must tell the people to bar their doors and windows. And no one is to wander the night.
Baron|And you… where do you think you're going?
Cirilla|Now, I ride for Novigrad. And then who knows where.
Baron|You have everythin'?
Cirilla|Yes, thank you.
Baron|What you did for me… I-- I shall never forget it.
Cirilla choice|We're even.
Cirilla choice|It's why I must go.
Cirilla|I certainly hope not. It's brought me no small trouble.
Baron|Meanin'?
Cirilla|I must flee.
<|endoftext|>
Baron|She mounted and rode off. It grew awfully empty without her…
Geralt|So there's a chance Ciri's still in Novigrad… Thanks for helping her.
Baron|It's nothin'. Now you've learned what you wanted to know, you must be in a hurry - but… if you could…
Geralt|Spit it out.
Baron|I want to go get Anna. Free her, bring her back. I don't believe she's there willingly.
Geralt|Must've not heard me. Any journey into the swamp is suicide.
Baron|I heard you - which is why I could use your aid.
Baron|I've no more tales of Ciri to offer you, but go with me and I'll be generous with what I do have. Very generous.
Geralt|Hmm… Extra coin never hurt.
Baron|Hah! True indeed! I'll round up my men and ride to Downwarren. You can join us there.
Geralt|Fine. Sounds good.
Geralt|What the…?
Sergeant|There you are!
Sergeant|Escaped again.
Sergeant|Sorry. We was never here.
Geralt|What was that?
Baron|You tell me. Man or monster? My men call him Uma and say he's a beast, but he seems a man to me, just hideous as Ardal's shit.
Geralt|Hmm… Doesn't look like a monster, but my medallion's trembling. Strange. Where'd you find him?
Baron|Funny story, actually. I won him in a game of cards.
Geralt|Funny story? How so?
Baron|Went to Novigrad once, to rest, indulge in the city's pleasures. Stayed at a tavern, and some folk there were playin', so I joined in.
Baron|Cards were kind that day. Had one devilish hand after another, robbed the whoresons blind. One fellow, a merchant, took it especially hard. He'd gambled away everything he'd brought from Skellige. Wanted terribly to play another hand, so I agreed.
Baron|Asked him what he had to wager, and he showed me that sideshow. Not much in it for me, but fuck it, I thought - I'll give the man a chance to win something back. Luck was not with him, and Uma wound up here at Crow's Perch. End of story.
Geralt|Proper baron now - even got a jester.
Baron|Aye… Though I feel something's not right with him.
Geralt|How so?
Baron|Well, he seems more beast than man, but there's wisdom, cunning in the bastard's eyes. Or maybe I'm imagining it. Ever run into anything like him?
Geralt|No. But he doesn't look dangerous.
Baron|Hmm… I guess that's that. Doesn't eat much, so as long as he's no trouble, the boys might as well have some diversion.
Geralt|Time I was on my way. So long.
Baron|Farewell. I hope you find your daughter.
Baron|And prove a good father to her…
Geralt|Hilarious. Real side-splitter.
Baron|Ohh, you wouldn't know a good tale from a runny fart.
Geralt|Don't know who or what your Uma is, but I know he's linked to Ciri somehow.
Baron|What? Ah, c'mon, pull the other one. How on earth could that thing be tied to your daughter?
Geralt|Don't know yet. Gotta find a way to talk to him.
Baron|Hmm… I guess you've no reason to lie. Come back once you've found out how.
Baron|Till then he'll be safe here. 'Cause I don't imagine you know how to drag him around with you.
Geralt|Fine. In that case, I'm off. So long, Baron.
Geralt|Definitely man, trapped by a powerful curse. And linked somehow to Ciri.
Baron|What do you mean? How can that thing be tied to your Ciri?
Geralt|Long story, but I know he's the key to finding her. I need to take him to Kaer Morhen. Maybe the other witchers can help me lift the curse.
Baron|Hmm… If it'll help you find your daughter, I'd be a pure bastard to refuse. Take him.
Baron|He has a corner in the stables, I'll tell my men not to give you trouble.
Baron|The witcher here's gonna take Uma. No one's to get in his way.
Baron Bandit Weak 02|Aye, sir.
Geralt|Thanks, Baron. So long.
Geralt|Uma? Strange name.
Baron|Aye, strange. But he gave us no other.
Geralt|You mean he can talk?
Baron|Hardly… It was like this - I asked what they call him. He sat there, not sayin' a thing, tryin' to stick a toe up his nose.
Baron|So I grabbed his hand, looked him in the eyes and asked, "What's your name?" Gave me this damned foolish look and stammered, "Oooh… Uma?" And it stuck.
Geralt|Where'd you find him?
Geralt|Must've been pretty desperate to play for that.
Baron|Ah, quit your carping, smartarse. Someone wagered him, and we played. If anyone was desperate, it was the bugger's former master.
Baron|So, witcher! How do you like my court jester?
Baron|Maybe you can tell - is he man or beast? My men call him Uma, claim he's a monster, but seems to me he's a man, just hideous as Ardal's shit.
Geralt|What'll happen if I don't go with you?
Baron|To you? Nothin'. Though I'll probably lose a few more men in the swamps. I'm determined to make this journey.
Geralt|I'll think about it.
Baron|Fuck thinkin'. Just help me. I'll gather my men and ride to Downwarren. Once you've mulled it over, join us there.
Geralt|She disappeared from Novigrad, too. Checked that. Thanks for helping her.
Geralt|Redanian army's blocked the Pontar crossing, yet you sent Ciri to Novigrad.
Baron|She was looking for a sorceress, and all of them are in Novigrad. Besides, I didn't leave her at the Redanians' mercy. I gave her a letter of safe conduct.
Geralt|Who was the letter to?
Baron|No one. It was like this one. Show that to those pricks at the crossing and they'll let you pass.
Geralt|This for me?
Baron|See no reason to make things harder for you. You seek your child, this letter will help.
Geralt|Where'd you get these letters?
Baron|Haven't always led this pack of jesters. Served in the Temerian army once.
Geralt|Redanians guard the crossing.
Baron|True, but with a bit of fame and a friend here and there… well, banners and heraldry don't mean so much.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Before you go, your father asked me to give you this.
Tamara|Clara? Father told you to give me Clara?
Tamara|Funny how he thought to buy me back with a memory. Tell him one gesture could never make up for a ruined childhood.
Tamara|So long, witcher. In spite of all I'm… well, I'm grateful you gave me a choice, didn't force me to go back to the tyrant.
Geralt|Hope you know what you're getting yourself into. So long. And good luck.
Geralt|Glad you know who I am. Haven't introduced yourself, though.
Graden|Graden, witch hunter in the service of His Royal Majesty Radovid of Redania. I'm certain you've heard of us.
Geralt|Rings a bell.
Graden|If the Bloody Baron sent you to fetch his daughter, you'd best face it - you will fail in your task.
Geralt|I appreciate your concern, but I don't need it. As for Tamara, she can make her own decisions.
Graden|Hmm, akh akh… Noble of you. A killer for hire abandoning his bounty for the good of another. The hunters and the Church of the Eternal Fire thank you.
Graden|So the baron hired a witcher to find his daughter. Interesting.
Geralt|Desperate fathers have been known to do a lot to find their daughters.
Graden|Unexpected from a witcher. Akh akh… I thought your mutations cleansed you of humanity, stripped you of emotions…
Geralt|You don't need mutations to strip men of their humanity. I've seen plenty of examples.
Geralt|Hence the candlesticks in your room. So, you believe in the Eternal Fire.
Tamara|Once the heat of the Fire has set your heart aflame, it gives you strength and leads you down the path of truth for the rest of your life.
Tamara|I hope it'll bless you with its warmth one day.
Geralt|Thanks. Thing is, fire's tricky. It's easy to get burned.
Geralt|Wouldn't be so sure of that. Been to Novigrad. Met the leader of the city's Temple Guard. Man named Menge. One mean son of a bitch.
Tamara|Doesn't mean they're all like that. Most are good, well-meaning people. I know they'll help.
Geralt|What about your father?
Tamara|Who? Oh, him. I don't care. I won't go back to him. That bit of my life - forgotten it already.
Geralt|Before I agreed to look for you, your father told me his version of events. Tell me yours.
Tamara|Mine? It's dull as life amidst the swamps. My earliest memories are of a drunken father lying under the stairs, caked in mud and clutching a bottle.
Tamara|Next dozen years, pretty much the same. Father would drink, disappear for days, then come home in a rage and send furniture flying. Thank the gods for war. I was glad every time they sent him off.
Tamara|And the quarrels… I remember him screaming at mum, the thuds as he beat her, then her sobbing. I'd hide under my bed and long for silence.
Tamara|That's the long and short of it. Multiply by nineteen and there you have my life. Finally we'd had enough, mum and me. He crossed the line and we fled.
Geralt|I don't mean to pry but… I know your mother had a miscarriage.
Tamara|His doing! He shoved her, she fell - that's how it started. We were alone, no one to help, blood everywhere… Worst night of my life.
Geralt|Sorry… must've been hard, for you both.
Tamara|Mum was in shock, she was raving that it was better this way, that she never wanted the child! Must've had a fever - she was losing blood the whole time.
Geralt|She didn't want the child?
Tamara|Said she'd sooner cut open her gut than bear another child from his seed.
Geralt|Voytek said some monster carried off your mother.
Tamara|That is what happened. It was enormous, twice the size of a bear, but much quicker and more agile. It grabbed mum before we could react. Now I don't even know if she's alive.
Geralt|Your mother's in Crookback Bog. Seems quite happy, actually. Though I think she's not quite right in the head.
Tamara|What?! She lives?! I must go there at once and get her out!
Geralt|Wouldn't recommend venturing into the swamp.
Tamara|I've made my decision. Won't let anyone talk me out of it.
Geralt|Voytek claims your mother had strange marks on her hands… and that a monster dragged her into the woods. That true?
Tamara|We were riding towards the river. Suddenly mum cried out, bent over, almost fell off her horse. I rode up to her and saw something strange - her hands were on fire.
Tamara|And then that creature leapt from the woods! I don't know what it was but it roared so fierce my nose bled. I saw it topple trees - I've never been so scared in my life!
Tamara|That… that thing grabbed my mum and disappeared into the woods! I wanted to turn back, go after them, but the horses panicked! Now I don't even know if she's alive.
Geralt|You're right, your father's a jackass.
Tamara|Glad we agree. But in that case, why are you helping him?
Geralt|Because he knows something about someone dear to me. Promised to tell me if I found you and your mother.
Tamara|Got it. A bit of blackmail - just his style.
Tamara|We'll, now you've found me, you can tell him I'm alive and I'm never coming back.
Geralt|Your father's a vile man. You're angry and bitter - can't blame you.
Tamara|Why do you help him then? Why did you take this job?
Geralt|I'm looking for Tamara, the Bloody Baron's daughter. Your brother said I'd find her here.
Verden Peasant 02|Voytek send you, sir?
Geralt|How else would I know she was here?
Verden Peasant 02|Wait a moment. I'll fetch her straight away.
<|endoftext|>
Verden Woman 01|So, gonna try to charm him? Did the witch give ye lovage?
Verden Woman 02|Aye, she did indeed. Didn't ask much for it, either.
Verden Woman 01|Maybe I should pay her a visit? How d'ye get there?
Verden Woman 02|Path past the pond - follow it till you reach a lone rock.
Verden Woman 02|Round that and head right off the path into the woods. Then keep straight.
Verden Woman 02|You'll know you've gone the right way when you pass an abandoned cart.
Geralt|Heard you talking about a witch. I'd like--
Verden Woman 01|You heard wrong.
Verden Woman 02|And you've wandered too far. Meager hovels here, that's all. You should get back on the high road whence ye came.
Geralt|About that witch…
Verden Woman 01|Leave us be or I'll call me man!
Verden Woman 02|Shhh… Someone's coming…
Verden Woman 01|Tell me everythin' later, dear.
Verden Woman 02|All right. Oh - and remember to take her some kinda offerin'.
Geralt|Oughta be able to find the witch now.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Good day. Heard you know where to find the local witch.
Verden Peasant 03|Who told you that?
Geralt|Your wife.
Verden Peasant 03|Daft wench.
Verden Peasant 03|Leave me be, and don't listen to that natterin' sow.
Verden Peasant 03|We've not had a witch, shaman, nor cunnin' wench in ages.
Geralt|Would a few crowns refresh your memory?
Verden Peasant 03|Oh! Well, if that's how you put it…
Verden Peasant 03|Know the small pond near the village? Path leads off from it. Follow that till you come across a lone rock.
Verden Peasant 03|Walk around that, into the woods. Find the old cart - you're there.
Geralt|Thanks.
Verden Peasant 03|It's just... don't harm her, sir. Word of your kind's reached these parts.
Geralt|"My kind" - meaning…?
Verden Peasant 03|Well, the witch-burnin' kind.
Geralt|No need to worry. I'm not out to hurt your witch.
Verden Peasant 03|Oo, a weight off me heart, sir. She only arrived a short while ago, but she's frightfully wise.
Verden Peasant 03|Even pleasant on the eyes, if you like 'em skinny.
Geralt|Thanks for your help. Farewell.
Geralt|Witch hunters've been here already?
Verden Peasant 03|Nay, but we've heard tell of 'em.
Verden Peasant 03|So when I spied ye comin', swords and all, straightaway I thought tales must be true.
Geralt|I'm a witcher. Not a witch hunter.
Verden Peasant 03|Hmm? What, not one and the same?
Geralt|No.
Geralt|You sure? Give it a think.
Verden Peasant 03|Won't take "no" for an answer, will ye? All right.
Geralt|You're hard at work. Won't interrupt.
Verden Peasant 03|Thank ye! Was a hair away from givin' up my soul out of fright itself…
Geralt|Point me in the direction of your local witch's hut?
Verden Peasant 03|...'Twouldn't be right to refuse you after you saved my skin.
Verden Peasant 03|Heeeelp!
Verden Peasant 03|What do ye want? I told ye I'll say naught about the witch.
<|endoftext|>
Verden Woman 05|Never visit the witch meself.
Verden Woman 05|I've my health, thank the gods, and for the rest? Well, she can't bake bread from stone either.
Verden Woman 04|Come on, this new one's not half bad.
Verden Woman 04|Sharp tongue on her, but she helps when there's a need.
Verden Woman 05|She can't fill our guts with spells.
Verden Woman 05|Besides, got no warts and she's not cross-eyed.
Verden Woman 05|And what's a witch with no gray on her head? Not much likely to be inside it…
Verden Woman 04|For one who never sees her, you seem to know a heap about her.
Verden Woman 05|I know what they say. Don't care much meself, but when folk talk, I listen.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Got a matter for your village witch. Know where I can find her?
Verden Woman 05|I don't bother with her meself, but ask my man - he'll know.
Verden Woman 05|Twerked his back so bad last week he could hardly move. So I sent him to the witch. Came back sprightly as a foal!
Geralt|Where is he?
Verden Woman 05|In the yard, no doubt. Pain's gone, but sloth's set in now. Should be huntin' foxberries, to feed our young 'uns.
Verden Woman 05|Marian's lad - now that man, he knows how to provide for his family. Caught some water rats last, they had food for days.
Verden Woman 05|Should send him back to the witch, might cure him of laziness.
Geralt|Greetings, ma'am.
Verden Woman 05|Good day to you, sir. Need somethin'?
Geralt|Farewell.
<|endoftext|>
Verden Old Man 03|Not from Velen - I get it right?
Geralt|You did.
Verden Old Man 03|So where ye from?
Geralt|Originally? Rivia.
Verden Old Man 03|Rivia! Blimey! That's a ways!
Geralt|A witch lives around here somewhere. You know her?
Verden Old Man 03|I do. From afar, that one, like yourself. But she listens, understands. Helpful - not like the old witch. That one were deaf as a stump and mean to boot.
Geralt|Know where I can find her?
Verden Old Man 03|Go to the pond - wild swans swam there once. Trail starts there.
Verden Old Man 03|Follow it to a great stone - dropped where it lies by a devil that a farmer'd tricked into thinkin' it was a giant egg. Then go right, into the woods. You'll pass a destitute cart and near it find the witch's hut.
Geralt|Thanks, been a big help.
Geralt|Farewell.
Verden Old Man 03|Oh, the Rivian again. What brings ye here?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Anyone home?
Geralt|Hm, normal candle.
Geralt|Powerful aura - must be some artifact, or…
Geralt|So this is where she disappeared to.
Geralt|A pentagram in chalk.
Geralt|There's the boulder…
Geralt|Now right, and on to the cart.
Geralt|Supposed to be a large stone near the pond.
Geralt|The cart… witch's hut is somewhere nearby.
Geralt|Now where's she run off to?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|The Wild Hunt.
Keira Metz|What?! Phantom riders? That means… I thought they didn't exist!
Geralt|Feast your eyes on the nonexistent, then.
Geralt|Hm. Got a navigator with them.
Keira Metz|A what?
Geralt|Can you teleport us to the other side?
Keira Metz|I'd rather teleport us home. Do you really mean to follow them?
Geralt|Teleport. Hurry up!
Keira Metz|Ready. Follow me!
Keira Metz|Aaaaargh!
Keira Metz|Aaargh!
Keira Metz|Geralt!
Keira Metz|Lillad geach! …Uuugh! Lillad geach--
Keira Metz|Geralt!
Keira Metz|Come on!
Keira Metz|Are you coming?
Keira Metz|Not sure I like any of this.
<|endoftext|>
Keira Metz|Geralt, do something! They're crawling out of those holes…!
Keira Metz|Use a Sign! Or bombs! Anything!
Geralt|Stay calm! They're only rats.
Keira Metz|I hate….! Uggggh! Rats!
Keira Metz|Whew, thank you.
Keira Metz|Get them off! Aaaaah!
Keira Metz|Uggggh! It's disgusting!
Keira Metz|Disgusting!
Keira Metz|Do you know the diseases they spread?!
Keira Metz|Exterminate them, I beg you!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|You that afraid of rats? Could've annihilated them with one spell.
Geralt|Fine, won't say anything… So, what happened to you?
Keira Metz|There's something here, something that distorts teleportation. I've no idea how they managed to get to the other side problem free.
Geralt|Wild Hunt's teleportation magic is different. Got specially trained mages for that - navigators they call them.
Keira Metz|They can have three helmsmen and a parrot for all I care. I'll not risk that again.
Geralt|Let's go. Wild Hunt got a good head start on us, but we still stand a chance.
Keira Metz|Have you gone completely mad? We must leave here at once!
Geralt|Let's go. We might still reach the elven mage before they do.
Keira Metz|But what does the Hunt want from him?
Geralt|If that elf has information about Ciri… Or if she tried to find him, contact him, even, and they sensed her…
Keira Metz|Very well. Let's move on. Perhaps we'll come across some clue, some trace left by this elf.
Keira Metz|There's no guarantee the Wild Hunt's is going the right way.
Geralt|If you're scared, turn back. I'm gonna go on.
Keira Metz|Stop it! That's emotional blackmail!
Geralt|You'd really worry about me if I went on alone?
Keira Metz|You?! I'd be concerned for myself!
Geralt|Then come with me. Just… quick decision, c'mon.
Keira Metz|Very well, have it your way. How did I ever let you talk me into this ridiculous expedition?!
Geralt|I gotta know what the Wild Hunt's doing here.
Keira Metz|But we came to find the elven mage, not fight the Hunt!
Geralt|If they reach him first, we won't get a chance to talk to him. Besides--
Keira Metz|Go on, finish. Wait, you've some special interest in the Hunt… Is this about Ciri? There's something you've not told me, isn't there?
Geralt|Come with me and maybe I will.
Keira Metz|Are you always like this? I'm beginning to feel sorry for Triss and Yen.
Keira Metz|Oh very well. Let's go.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Think that's a… swallow.
Avallach|{Faeve'te, larenna luned. } [I await you, Daughter of the Gull.]
Keira Metz|That's him! That's the elf!
Avallach|{Arvegh t'va gláeddyv. } [Follow the sign of your sword.]
Geralt|What was that? An illusion?
Keira Metz|No… A morphotic projection.
Geralt|Message was definitely for Ciri. "Daughter of the gull" - Lara Dorren's heir.
Keira Metz|Indeed, it is what the elves would title Ciri. But what was the bit about the sign of her sword? A riddle?
Geralt|Yeah, not a hard one, though. Not if you know Ciri named her sword Zireael - Swallow.
Keira Metz|Come now, who aside from you would know that?
Geralt|Might've been the point. Your elven mage secured the passage, hid it, so that only Ciri could find it.
Keira Metz|He failed to foresee that someone like you would show up.
Geralt|Nevertheless, I think he was expecting uninvited guests, made some preparations. Let's hope the Wild Hunt ran into some obstacles.
Keira Metz|Well then, let's go. Do you think following the swallows will suffice?
Geralt|We'll see.
Geralt|A what projection?
Keira Metz|Something akin to a postbox for mages.
Keira Metz|Much safer than an ordinary letter, which anyone can intercept en route to its recipient.
Avallach|{Larenna luned. } [Daughter of the Gull.]
Keira Metz|Oh!
Avallach|{Cáedmil. } [Greetings.]
Keira Metz|Well, now I know what distorted my effort at teleportation. This very portal.
Keira Metz|We must try to activate it.
Geralt|And I know why I landed in that drowner nest.
Keira Metz|You should be pleased you emerged from the portal in one piece.
Geralt|And everyone still wonders why I hate to be teleported.
Keira Metz|It worked. Come.
Geralt|Sure it's safe?
Keira Metz|Of course. The elven mage prepared this passage for Ciri. Come on, now.
<|endoftext|>
Keira Metz|An old elven… port?
Geralt|Must've been how they got here by sea.
Keira Metz|I wonder how long ago that was…
Geralt|Careful! That oily, yellow vapor - it's toxic.
Keira Metz|I hardly need instruction from you. I recognized the vulpine morel immediately.
Geralt|Vesemir told me that soon after he'd learned to cast Igni, he tried it out on a patch of these mushrooms.
Keira Metz|Terrible idea. What happened?
Geralt|Well, he survived. And wounds heal awfully quick on young witchers. Come on.
Keira Metz|Expect me to splash about in that sewage? Unlikely. I'll wait here.
Keira Metz|How was the water?
Geralt|Refreshing. Don't know what you're missing.
Keira Metz|A swallow. Seems we're headed the right way.
<|endoftext|>
Keira Metz|Must you touch everything?!
Geralt|Another swallow.
Keira Metz|Look. It's rather similar to that other pillar with the projection…
Geralt|Drawing of a horse. Clue for Ciri, must be.
Keira Metz|Geralt!
Geralt|Kelpie…
Geralt|Let's see what this does…
Keira Metz|Geralt? I don't know what you did, but it worked! Come back here!
Keira Metz|Let's go.
Keira Metz|Look, they're opening!
Geralt|Hunting dog. Can't see any connection to Kelpie.
Geralt|A sea monster. Looks a bit like a kayran.
Keira Metz|Geralt, what the hell is that?!
Geralt|Another security measure. Dammit all…
Keira Metz|Do you think it's a mind game of some sort?
Keira Metz|You know, can you defeat yourself? Are you willing to?
Keira Metz|Perhaps these apparitions believe they are real.
Geralt|Sorry, I just don't share your doubts. Know exactly which one of you's real.
Geralt|Now focus on the fight.
Keira Metz|I wonder what all this means. They look hastily scribbled on with lime.
Keira Metz|Geralt, are you all right?
Geralt|You might say so.
Keira Metz|Oof… Anything like that ever happen to you before?
Geralt|Weeell, almost. While back a certain doppler took a shot at impersonating me.
Keira Metz|Yes? And?
Geralt|He hated being me. Felt uncomfortable. Dopplers're kind-hearted by nature.
Geralt|Another horse. Almost exactly like the last one.
Geralt|Water's vibrating. As if boulders were moving beneath the surface.
<|endoftext|>
Keira Metz|Come on.
Geralt|Another swallow…
Keira Metz|Look, it worked.
Keira Metz|I've a bad feeling about this…
Golem|Zireael not recognized. Intruders. Destroy the intruders.
Keira Metz|How many sentries can he have?! This elf must be utterly paranoid!
Geralt|Teleport over there.
Keira Metz|We must activate it quickly. I've a feeling another golem's about to surprise us.
Keira Metz|It's grown awfully quiet.
Geralt|Is that bad?
Keira Metz|A bit like the calm before a storm…
Keira Metz|Once you finally find Ciri, what will you do? Any plans?
Geralt|Depends what she wants.
Keira Metz|Imagined it - how it will… transpire? What will she say? What will she look like?
Geralt|No.
Keira Metz|I'm sorry. For getting ahead of myself. At times I forget…
Keira Metz|… we hardly know each other, certainly not enough to discuss personal matters.
Geralt|Not to worry. We'll get there.
Keira Metz|And that would be that! I knew we'd manage.
Geralt|That so? Make sure and tell me beforehand next time.
Keira Metz|My intuition's a fine instrument, witcher. Don't underestimate it.
Keira Metz|I've some veeery good feelings about you, for instance. In several domains.
Keira Metz|Uh-oh.
Geralt|What? Got that feeling again?
Keira Metz|And more…
<|endoftext|>
Caranthir|Shaar'az!
Eredin|{Esai isse. } [They're here already.]
Eredin|{Tabha'ar doin'ne. Ni linn yih'amar. } [Tend to them. We've no time to lose.]
Caranthir|{Raenn. } [Go.]
Caranthir|Shaent tah'vir!
Keira Metz|What is this?!
Geralt|The White Frost! Mage from the Hunt summoned it!
Geralt|Can you seal those cracks it's blowing through?!
Keira Metz|They're too far! We must get closer! I shall shield us with Demetia Crest's Surge!
Keira Metz|Stand at my side!
<|endoftext|>
Keira Metz|Come here!
Keira Metz|You tend to the monsters! I'll be able to keep them away from me!
Keira Metz|We must close them…!
Geralt|Want me to go…?!
Keira Metz|I'll do it, just cover me!
Keira Metz|Da'arian annoi!
Keira Metz|Whew, I'm beginning to think we might make it.
Geralt|Just one more.
Keira Metz|Mhm.
Keira Metz|It worked…
Keira Metz|Ready! Stay close!
Geralt|Hm, they blocked the passage. Maybe I can try--
Keira Metz|Leave it to me.
Keira Metz|Bhain'ne calar!
Keira Metz|Come. We might still catch them.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What's wrong?
Keira Metz|It'll pass… That took… a great deal of Power.
Geralt|Just don't faint on me.
Keira Metz|Now, in your firm embrace? Not on your life.
Geralt|Ahem. Love to be able to say we could stay here awhile and rest…
Keira Metz|I know, I know. We must go on.
Geralt|If you can't go on…
Keira Metz|You can't leave me here!
Geralt|I'd never do that.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Can you translate the inscription? I can decipher maybe a third, but that third doesn't make much sense.
Keira Metz|Give me a minute. I was never any good at the high variant of the Elder Speech…
Keira Metz|Hm, all right. This might seem a bit literal. I'm afraid I can't replicate its sophisticated internal rhymes.
Geralt|Just - translate it to make sense.
Geralt|Hm… Sounds like a riddle, all right.
Geralt|Mind repeating the riddle?
Geralt|All right. Let's see if we can't solve this.
Keira Metz|Hm, lit up like a charm.
Keira Metz|Looks like another damned riddle to me.
Keira Metz|It worked!
Keira Metz|Um, seems we did something wrong.
Geralt|Inscription here.
Keira Metz|Show me!
Geralt|Let's try it. Just gotta figure out the order.
Keira Metz|Four statues, each like the other…
Geralt|Really similar, these statues…
Keira Metz|Doesn't help, does it?
Keira Metz|"Four guardians, four flames, standing proud in a line.
Keira Metz|The First to light his fire dared not march on the end. The Second, by the First, played a woeful lament.
Keira Metz|The Third kept close to his faithful beast. The Fourth marched not beside the First, yet like the Second, played a tune.
Keira Metz|And thus they stood o'er their queen, who slept beneath flickering stars."
Keira Metz|How about that, you changed your mind.
Geralt|Miss me?
Keira Metz|Hardly. Now focus.
Keira Metz|Oooh!
Geralt|Looks like some elven sanctuary…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Yeah, I'll help.
Keira Metz|Splendid. Come, then.
Geralt|Gotta look for it alone. I should go to Crookback Bog. Think you can manage?
Keira Metz|Of course I can. Best of luck to you.
Geralt|I'll stop by. You can be sure.
Keira Metz|In that case, I shall be waiting.
Geralt|See you, Keira.
Keira Metz|Do you feel that? A flow of fresh air, from the left? Must be an exit that way!
Geralt|Good, let's get outta here.
Keira Metz|Wait. There's still the magic lamp.
Geralt|The magic what now?
Keira Metz|Lamp. The elf promised it to me in exchange for my help. And since his return here seems doubtful, I must retrieve it myself.
Keira Metz|If I can find it, that is… Will you help?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Strange. My medallion's trembling, but there's nothing here… What's with this wall?
Keira Metz|It's an illusion. I sensed it as well.
Keira Metz|I expected we might run into such things, so I brought this.
Geralt|Meaning what?
Keira Metz|The Eye of Nehaleni. It dispels illusions. It's easy enough to build, so you're welcome to this one. It's bound to come in handy.
Keira Metz|And, each time it does, you will think of me.
Geralt|Hm, thanks.
Keira Metz|Simple, isn't it?
Geralt|Mhm. Let's see where the passage leads.
<|endoftext|>
Keira Metz|He must've left it somewhere here…
Keira Metz|Why'd we even come…
Geralt|All right, let's watch this message.
Keira Metz|We're certain to find something here.
Geralt|Hm, really works.
Geralt|The witches of Crookback Swamp…
Keira Metz|Crookback Bog.
Geralt|Keira! If you're hiding something…
Keira Metz|But - I didn't say…
Geralt|How do I find them?
Keira Metz|The swamps are vast, dangerous, but they say the Crones mark the way for peasants who wish to visit them. The manuscript mentions a chapel in Crookback Bog. And from that chapel one must follow a Trail of Treats.
Geralt|Treats?
Keira Metz|Of course, they didn't read you bedtime stories at Kaer Morhen. All normal folk know that witches live in gingerbread houses poised atop chicken legs.
Geralt|I'll have to see that to believe it.
Keira Metz|Take the tome and read it. I… I truly do believe you'll find your Cirilla.
Keira Metz|All right, then. As a start, let's look for a way out of here.
Geralt|Good idea.
Geralt|You know these witches?
Keira Metz|I've never met them, but I've read of them. In an old manuscript I found in one of the huts in the village.
Keira Metz|It mentions the village witches venturing into Crookback Bog at times - to liaise between the villagers and the Crones, the Ladies of the Wood.
Keira Metz|The Crones appear to be intolerant of outsiders, but they help the local folk. Apparently, they stopped the spread of the plague in Velen.
Geralt|Hm. What's your take on this?
Keira Metz|I'd love to shrug it off as the nattering of so many old women, yet…
Keira Metz|Throughout my first fortnight in Velen, I had horrible nightmares. Something was calling me out into the swamps.
Keira Metz|One night I decided to enter the dream consciously, render it lucid. I confronted the… thing directly. It broke contact at once. Peaceful nights ever since.
Geralt|Why didn't you say anything earlier? I told you Ciri had a run in with a witch.
Keira Metz|I had no idea you meant them… If I'd told you something, you would have rushed off to find them…
Keira Metz|But we needed first to confirm that Ciri was here, didn't we?
Keira Metz|I shall tell you everything now, of course.
Geralt|Now, after I safely led you through the cave?
Keira Metz|I can't believe you'd think so poorly of me. Perhaps you do bear a grudge against sorceresses.
Geralt|Mhm. Can't imagine where that comes from.
Geralt|Wonder why they split up.
Keira Metz|Perhaps because the Wild Hunt was on the elf's trail, and Ciri would be safer if they did.
Geralt|"Where last we were together." Not much to go on.
Geralt|Dammit!
Keira Metz|Perhaps it's best he didn't leave a clearer message. The Wild Hunt broke in here, surely they saw the projection.
Geralt|They searched everything… and if they had more time, they'd probably have torn the place to the ground.
Geralt|But that doesn't change the fact that we haven't learned anything - not about the elf, not about Ciri.
Keira Metz|Well, we know they were well acquainted, and traveling together.
Avallach|Zireael, this place is no longer safe. Do not tarry here long.
Avallach|Trust no one, and above all beware the witches of Crookback Bog.
Avallach|Try to reach the place where last we were together.
Keira Metz|Oh, changed your mind, have you?
Keira Metz|You were supposed to help me! Geralt!
Keira Metz|Look! The elf left another message for Ciri!
Geralt|Gotta activate the projection.
Keira Metz|All right, where's that swallow?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|This what you're looking for?
Keira Metz|Ahah!
Geralt|So what's it supposed to do?
Keira Metz|Hm, I hope I'll be able to activate it… Let's leave this place, shall we?
Keira Metz|Whose grave is it - what do you think? No inscription, sadly.
Geralt|Hm… Sign of the gull. If I didn't already know where she was buried, I'd guess this is Lara Dorren's sepulcher.
Keira Metz|Perhaps it's a monument to her?
Geralt|Can't see the elves commemorating her this way. Heroine of a tragic legend to some, but…
Geralt|Most see her as a traitor to her race, who got her just deserts for marrying Cregennan of Lod.
Keira Metz|Perhaps the elven mage is Lara's kin. It would explain why he's helping Ciri.
Geralt|Possible.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Interesting rhyme.
Verden Girl 01|Don't know you. Go away.
Geralt|A young woman got lost in the swamp. She has ashen hair and a scar on her face. You kids see anyone like that?
Verden Boy 01|Ain't no lassies here.
Verden Girl 01|What am I?
Verden Boy 01|You're no lassie. Lassies got tits.
Verden Boy 02|They do. Heard an ol' man say once, when the army was here, he says, "Hide them lasses in the woods! They's dazzlin' the soldiers with their tits, and it's torturin' the poor lads!" That's what he said.
Geralt|Listen, the girl I'm looking for, she's in trouble. I understand you might not want to help me, but you could try to help her.
Verden Boy 01|How you know she was here?
Geralt|I heard she visited the witches in the swamp.
Verden Boy 02|But there's no witches here.
Verden Girl 01|There's only frogs.
Verden Boy 01|And snakes.
Verden Boy 02|And Johnny.
Celina|What's this talk? What kind o' jabberin' is this? Eh?
Celina|No one allowed here! Just kids. My kids, they're allowed. But who are you? Wearin' swords, like a bandit?
Geralt|Just talking to the kids. Asked them if they'd seen a young woman.
Celina|I was a lovely young woman. Wore a long, beautiful braid my mummy did up for me. Had dresses with flowers on 'em.
Geralt|Maybe you've seen her. Young... Ashen hair.
Celina|Your betrothed?
Geralt|Daughter, actually.
Celina|Daughter... My dear, sweet little daughter and her sister. Where are they now? Maybe they've come to some harm...?
Geralt|A bit of help, please? A young, ashen-haired woman. Just need to know if you've seen her.
Celina|What are you looking at, children? Wash your hands, we'll go catch crickets.
Geralt|Won't learn anything from you.
Celina|Aye. 'Cause I don't know nothin'.
Verden Boy 02|Bet Johnny knows. He knows a lot. When I ask 'im somethin', he says: "Wait, I'll scratch my arse and tell you."
Celina|Ugly word! What're you sayin'? To the hut. You'll stand in a corner, I'll make sure you do.
Celina|You - begone. Begone.
Geralt|Had about enough of this.
Geralt|Asked a simple question. You seen the woman or haven't you?
Celina|Fear not, children…
Verden Girl 02|There's naught to fear, Gran. He's only angry 'cause he cares.
Verden Boy 02|Maybe Johnny knows somethin'? I'll take 'im to Johnny, afore he goes barmy on us…
Celina|Johnny's your invention - and you shouldn't be usin' those ugly words. To the hut! Go on, now! You'll stand in a corner, I'll make sure you do.
Celina|And you stop scarin' the little ones. Now go! Begone!
Geralt|Who's Johnny?
Verden Boy 02|Johnny, Johnny, ate a cat, come the morn some fur he shat!
Celina|Watch your language!
Celina|They tells tales and tales. Naught but tales.
Geralt|You one of the witches of the swamp? I hear Crookback Bog…
Celina|Witch? Me? Nay… I've no broom, nor owl, and not one wart on me nose. Got a pretty nose. See?
Verden Girl 01|Gran's got a lovely beak.
Celina|Oh, you darling girl. Kids are so sweet.
Geralt|You look after these kids?
Celina|They're my grandchildren.
Verden Boy 01|Gran's good to us. Gonna be soup with scratchings for supper!
Celina|Kids get lost in the woods... I miss 'em... Seen 'em in the woods? No one has.
Geralt|Anyone else here? Besides you?
Verden Boy 01|Meaning who?
Geralt|Someone who might've seen the woman.
Verden Girl 01|Like the six-eyed tree?
Verden Boy 02|Tree's slept all year. But there is Johnny.
Geralt|I'm looking for the witches of Crookback Bog.
Verden Girl 01|You looks like a witch you'self.
Verden Boy 01|The wi... witches? Of the bog?
Verden Girl 01|We can't go in the bog. Gran don't let us.
Verden Boy 01|When my brother Zemek went missin', Gran said it was 'cause he went in the woods and got lost. Gran cried an awful lot after that.
Verden Girl 01|He could still come back.
Geralt|What are you doing out here alone?
Verden Boy 01|We's not alone, we's with Gran.
Geralt|But where did you all come from?
Verden Boy 02|We's orphans.
Geralt|All of you?
Verden Boy 02|There's a war, so there's orphans. Didn't know that?
Verden Boy 01|Dog went in the kitchen, stole a hunk of meat.
Verden Girl 03|Cook gave him a lickin', strung him by his feet.
Verden Boy 02|Cook then bled him empty, stripped his skin off clean.
Verden Girl 02|Laughed and said, "How tasty, best sausage I have seen!"
Verden Girl 01|Cook's a stupid killer, shouldn't 'ave ate the pup.
Verden Boy 01|Now we'll light a fire, gonna roast him up!
Verden Girl 03|One, two, three, the one to fetch the kindling's… thee!
<|endoftext|>
Celina|Can't come in here. Not allowed in here.
Geralt|I just wanna talk to the boy.
Celina|Not allowed. It's not allowed.
Verden Boy 02|I won't talk to you anyway. Gran don't like you. An-- and Johnny's made up. An-- and strangers steal kids.
Geralt|Just got one question for you.
Celina|Don't be askin' no questions. You're a stranger. Not allowed to talk to strangers.
Verden Boy 02|Can we eat now? Soup with scratchings…
Celina|You hear? Says he's afeard of you. Stop scarin' my kids.
Geralt|Just tell me where I can find Johnny.
Verden Boy 02|Johnny's made up.
Celina|Begone, begone.
Geralt|Mhm… See you.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Don't be afraid...
Verden Boy 02|Don't know nuthin'.
Geralt|I won't hurt you.
Verden Boy 02|Where's Gran?
Geralt|She's busy.
Geralt|I just wanna talk to Johnny. He could know more than you.
Verden Boy 02|…Not gonna hurt 'im, right? 'Cause… he's real, he's not made up.
Geralt|I'm not gonna hurt him.
Verden Boy 02|Johnny used to be by, 'cause Gran liked listenin' to his songs. When we was pickin' mushrooms, Johnny said he saw a girl with ashen hair in the swamp.
Geralt|Where can I find Johnny?
Verden Boy 02|There's a little meadow on the edge of the swamp. This strange tree grows there. Look around, you'll see 'im.
Geralt|Thank you.
Geralt|Why're you scared to talk?
Verden Boy 02|I'm not scared of nuthin'!
Geralt|You're all scared of something. Woulda told me about Johnny otherwise.
Verden Boy 02|I'm worried about Johnny. He don't come 'round no more. Once when we was mushroom pickin', I saw his burrow.
Verden Boy 02|But Gran yelled at me. Said not to talk to strangers, 'cause then kids go missin'. She worries 'bout Johnny too, though she says he's made up.
Geralt|Where are you and your friends' parents?
Verden Boy 02|Dead. Some starved… others were killed. Like mine…
Verden Boy 02|One day, I went out at dawn, to look for berries in the woods... Still some around back then. When I was comin' home, I heard the yells... Then laughing…
Verden Boy 02|Went up and hid in the bushes near the woods. My mum yelled. And the soldiers laughed. Laid my pa down by the barn door... His head clean off... And then my mum…
Geralt|It's all right, that's enough...
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Let's play. You hide, but if I find you, you have to help me talk to the boy who knows Johnny.
Verden Boy 01|He thinks he'll find us easy.
Verden Girl 01|Means he's never hid from the Black Ones.
Verden Girl 01|No lookin', and you have to count out loud - all your fingers. Toes, too.
Geralt|One, two, three...
Geralt|Eighteen, nineteen, twenty.
Geralt|Ready or not, here I come.
Geralt|Is there something else you need or want?
Verden Girl 02|Hmm... I want... something sweet!
Verden Girl 01|Me too!
Verden Girl 02|Or fruits...
Verden Girl 03|Give us a treat and we'll help you.
Geralt|Don't have any treats.
Verden Boy 01|Well here's what you can do: go get some, play hide-n-seek with us, or get lost.
Geralt|Let me see if I can find some treats.
Geralt|Here's some treats.
Verden Girl 02|Yum!
Verden Girl 03|Never eatin' nothin' like this before in me life!
Geralt|Why don't you wanna talk about Johnny? One of you knows about him - the others must too.
Verden Boy 01|It's just him who's pals with Johnny. They pick mushrooms. And hunt snails. But Gran says Johnny's made up.
Geralt|The girl I mentioned is in danger. You gotta help me get your gran away from the hut so I can talk to Johnny's friend.
Verden Girl 03|All right, but you gotta do somethin' for us, too. Play hide-n-seek. Gran never does, says her feet hurt.
Geralt|Have any of you ever seen Johnny?
Verden Girl 01|Course. Looks just like him.
Geralt|Then why do you say he's made up?
Verden Girl 03|Gran says so, and Gran knows lots.
Geralt|Does your gran treat you right? She ever hurt you?
Verden Girl 02|Never.
Verden Girl 01|When we're bad, she cries.
Verden Girl 02|She's scared, says strangers might take us… and we'll disappear.
Geralt|The boy who plays with Johnny - he must be brave.
Verden Girl 01|Not brave, just stupid.
Verden Boy 01|Sat his bare bum on an anthill once. But, yeah, he plays with Johnny. He don't listen to Gran and goes in the woods, and then he's gotta have a time-out.
Verden Girl 01|And he eats snails. Yuck.
Verden Boy 01|Have you brought us some treats, or do you wanna play hide-n-seek?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Can't understand you. Try to explain it somehow…?
Godling Johnny|{Johnny puts his thumb on his forehead}
Godling Johnny|{Indicates for Geralt to follow him}
Geralt|Want me to follow you?
Godling Johnny|{energetically nods}
Geralt|No choice, I guess.
Godling Johnny|{doesn't have a choice}
Geralt|What's wrong, can't talk?
Godling Johnny|{nods energetically}
Geralt|Why?
Godling Johnny|{makes some firm motion showing his impatience}
Geralt|Lost your voice?
Godling Johnny|{nods energetically}
Geralt|Can I help you somehow?
Godling Johnny|{nods and signals Geralt to follow him}
Geralt|You know the kids from the clearing well?
Godling Johnny|{suspicious look at Geralt}
Geralt|Don't be afraid. Not gonna hurt anyone.
Geralt|This where you live?
Godling Johnny|{nods, is proud}
Geralt|Cozy burrow, good location. Must know about everything that happens in the bog.
Godling Johnny|{tilts his head}
Geralt|Doesn't bother you, having monsters for neighbors?
Godling Johnny|{points to himself, and then shows how scary he is and how he scares off monsters}
Geralt|Johnny?
Geralt|Don't be afraid.
Geralt|You're a bucca...?
Godling Johnny|{shakes his head}
Geralt|A lutin...?
Godling Johnny|{shakes his head}
Geralt|Ah, a godling. Not many of you left.
Godling Johnny|{nods}
Geralt|I'm looking for a woman with ashen hair. Seen her?
Godling Johnny|{nods yes}
Geralt|Tell me everything, from the start. Where did you see her, what was she doing? It's important to me.
Godling Johnny|{shakes his head}
Geralt|Why not?
Godling Johnny|{gestures to indicate he can't talk}
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|This the place? Let me look around.
Godling Johnny|{points up to a cliff edge with ravens circling above it}
Geralt|Something's on the ledge? Something that'll get you your voice back?
Godling Johnny|{energetically nods}
Geralt|Guess I gotta make this climb.
Godling Johnny|{nods, pleased}
Geralt|Ah, the bottle from the nest. Already got it.
Godling Johnny|{Reaches out for the bottle and waits impatiently}
Geralt|Here.
Godling Johnny|{Struggles to remove cork}
Godling Johnny|Whiskey! Slither! Ringworm! Rubbish! Bumblebee! Flabbergasted! Ha! The sound of it!
Godling Johnny|Peter Piper picked Prince Proximo a peck of pickled peppers by the Pontar. Hahaha.
Geralt|Done celebrating?
Godling Johnny|My favorite words... Life without savoring the sound of "surreptitious shananacking" is like licking snails through a cloth.
Godling Johnny|Thank you for this, noble whoever-you-are. Long be your life.
Geralt|Hang on a minute... I helped you - now you help me.
Godling Johnny|Would you turn this beautiful act of altruism into a banal bartering of favors?
Geralt|I'm looking for a young, ashen-haired woman. See anyone like that?
Godling Johnny|Did I ever. Remember it as if it were yesterday. Soon as I woke, I went to empty my bowels - my favorite part of the day. Defecatin' to the sunrise - downright glorious…
Godling Johnny|Suddenly, heard a bang - so loud it couldn't 'ave been me. And that lass appeared! Out of nowhere. Young, ashen-haired - just like you said. Wounded, and panting to boot!
Godling Johnny|She raced off towards the children's huts. Quick - as if the Crones were after her. I yelled some unpleasantries - she'd disturbed my morn. Sadly, I'd lost my voice, so I don't think she heard me.
Geralt|She ran off toward the orphanage. Kids could know something, or the old woman who takes care of them…
Godling Johnny|That old hag don't speak to strangers. And you're a stranger.
Geralt|Will she talk to you?
Godling Johnny|I have spoken to her, got my ways… So be it. You helped me, and I'm no boor. Come with me.
Geralt|What do you know about the Crones?
Godling Johnny|They're as old as this forest. Cruel, vindictive… Not to be crossed.
Geralt|What if someone does cross them?
Godling Johnny|Might take his voice, might take his life - depends on their whim. They're nasty, although… they care for this land and its folk in their own way. Supposedly they always keep their word, but you must be careful what you ask for.
Godling Johnny|Won't find them until they want to be found, see them until they want to be seen. But remember, they see and hear all that happens in the mire.
Geralt|I've been to the village in the swamp, met a woman who might've been a Crone.
Godling Johnny|Did she seem… confused to you?
Geralt|Nuts, completely.
Godling Johnny|Oof, so I'm not crazy. That's no Crone, that's the granny who takes care of the orphans. Claims the kids made me up. Me.
Geralt|An orphanage in a swamp?
Godling Johnny|What d'you have against swamps? Lived here my whole life and I heartily recommend it.
Geralt|How'd you lose your voice?
Godling Johnny|One morning I awoke and opened my mouth for my usual bout of singing with the thrushes. Lo and behold, no sound escaped. I tried and tried, almost burst a blood vessel.
Godling Johnny|Then I went to the village, 'cause word has it the new cunning woman works miracles. But people began crying out "A smudger! A smudger!" and sicced their dogs on me.
Godling Johnny|Do I look like a smudger to you?
Geralt|Not a bit.
Godling Johnny|I thought not. So it must be the Crones' doing. Who else would curse me? Blackbird friend of mine located my voice, but I was helpless to retrieve it.
Geralt|Couldn't ask a raven friend to just give you the bottle?
Godling Johnny|Ravens serve the Crones. They don't help no one.
Geralt|How do you lock someone's voice in a bottle? Just wondering…
Godling Johnny|As am I - especially as mine's a voice to crown all voices. Sometimes it's like a forest brook, at others like a roll of thunder. And let's be honest - I talk enough to fill three barrels and more.
Geralt|Somebody used some powerful magic on you - as a prank or just to be mean.
<|endoftext|>
Godling Johnny|Good. It's clear. Not a Crone in sight. I need to sing to Gran, that oughta calm her.
Godling Johnny|Little Johnny softly gazing, fire waning, pale
Godling Johnny|Pop! A spark jumped out and whispered…
Godling Johnny|Listen, I've a tale…
Celina|You... got your voice back?
Godling Johnny|I did! Though I seem to have lost an octave somewhere in the process. I shall look for it when I get home.
Celina|You're not allowed here, Johnny. You shouldn't 'ave come.
Godling Johnny|Calm down, Gran. Don't get angry - it's not good for you.
Geralt|The woman I asked about earlier...
Godling Johnny|Forgive me, Gran, but this fellow absolutely must talk to the Ladies.
Celina|No, 'tis not allowed.
Geralt|Please. It's important.
Godling Johnny|The fellow will be quiet. Gran, please hear me out.
Godling Johnny|I found little Yagna when she got lost, did I not? Did I break Genny's fever too? I did. I ask anything in return? No. Didn't even fuss about my stolen voice.
Godling Johnny|Well, now I want something. Gran, help this fellow. Because otherwise he'll pester me day and night, even durin' potty time. His lass is missing, mayhaps the Ladies can help find her, eh?
Celina|Well, since you put it that way, Johnny... I'll help him.
Celina|Come with me.
Geralt|Can you take me to the Crones?
<|endoftext|>
Celina|Johnny's a good, good lad. Though the Ladies don't like him, no… "Foul creature," they say. Don't like him.
Geralt|Who are the women in the tapestry?
Celina|Those're the Ladies.
Celina|Ladies lovely, with power o'er all,<br>Beseech I thee, answer my call,<br>Before you a worm crawls, wretched and small.
Celina|How dare you disturb our rest, woman?
Geralt|I'm looking for the woman with ashen hair. I know you met her. Where is she?
Celina|Ooooh, he's impatient!
Celina|Perhaps he only likes ashen-haired girls?
Geralt|It's clear you met her. Tell me everything.
Celina|That was blunt. Well, perhaps it's for the best. Tell me, have you got bollocks? Do you fear woodland beasts?
Celina|Oh, hard times are upon us, White-Haired One. Brother has turned against brother, the land is soaked in blood. Evil reigns stronger than ever before.
Celina|A dark power has surfaced near Downwarren. It feeds on hatred and disdain. Destroy the beast, and we will be grateful, tell you all we know about this ashen-haired maid.
Geralt|Dark power? You need a knight-errant, or a witch hunter, not a witcher.
Celina|The ealdorman of Downwarren will tell you all. Remember to collect payment from him after you complete your task.
Celina|And now our servant will bring you the dagger.
Geralt|I'll talk to the ealdorman, but I can't promise anything.
Celina|Move, woman! Give the young man the dagger!
Celina|And you, White One - return only once you've completed the task.
Celina|Aye, mistress. Right. On my way. Dagger. Gotta bring the dagger…
Celina|The dagger. For you. Ladies told me to give it to you - here it is. The dagger.
Celina|Place the ealdorman's payment on the stone.
Celina|Stone bare, stone shear, stone knows, stone hears…
Geralt|A dagger? What for?
Celina|When the ealdorman sees this dagger, he'll know we sent you. He'll aid with all.
Geralt|The young woman... She's my daughter by choice, I raised her.
Celina|Huhuha. If she's shapely, what does it matter?
Geralt|Matters to me.
Celina|I believe we've hit a nerve! He's bubbling like well-fed yeast.
Celina|Ooh, that's how I likes 'em.
Geralt|So you're the three Crones?
Celina|Crones? Where d'you get such an ugly word, young man?
Celina|Village bitches have been gossiping again.
Celina|There's no limit to how jealous and petty humans can be. Do we look like crones to you?
Celina|Go ahead, check. Touch me, White-Haired One. Where it pleases you most.
Geralt|Is this a curse? You trapped in the tapestry?
Celina|Oh, he's curious.
Celina|We don't fall victim to curses - we cast them.
Geralt|Is it my imagination, or is this tapestry made of hair?
Celina|Ooh, he's got a sensitive touch.
Celina|Touch me more, boy, touch me more.
Geralt|Where do you get human hair?
Celina|Never heard of the Cutting? 'Round here a young boy turns into a man when they cut his hair for the first time.
Celina|Our sister weaves tapestries of this cut hair. If the weft is straight, happy's the fate.
Geralt|What if the weft's crooked?
Celina|Then it must be unraveled.
Geralt|Someone's speaking through you?
Celina|Good looking and clever, too. Where've you been hiding, boy?
Geralt|It was my idea. I need to talk to you.
Celina|And who is this charming young man? Looks a tasty morsel, he does.
Celina|Big and strong. Like a taut tendon.
Celina|Quiet. Let him speak.
Geralt|I'm a witcher. Monsters don't scare me.
Celina|We've heard a thing or two about witchers, their lust.
Geralt|Mind if we stop chatting and get to the point?
Celina|Hot-headed you are.
<|endoftext|>
Verden Peasant 02|There's payment. Take it to the Ladies, will ye?
Geralt|What the hell was that?
Verden Peasant 02|Tis our pact. Ye're a stranger, ye don't know life here. It's honest pay for their protection.
Geralt|So all those ears in the woods…
Verden Peasant 02|Put it out yer mind, master. Ye soon be leavin', and we must tarry on. Our young'uns, and their young'uns after 'em.
Verden Peasant 02|No gods nor masters watch over Velen. The land is no man's. He who wants to survive must seek his own protectors.
Geralt|The Crones, or the Ladies of the Wood, as you call them, said to remind you about payment. Take it you know what they want.
Verden Peasant 02|Aye, I do. Gimme the dagger… Be back soon.
Geralt|Some being had come to possess the tree's heart. I destroyed the heart and its inhabitant.
Verden Peasant 02|So it were a ghost…
Verden Peasant 02|Will it be back?
Geralt|No.
Geralt|Didn't have to fight anything or anyone. I simply freed the spirit.
Verden Peasant 02|Ye did what?! Freed the evil, so it can prowl the world as it will?
Geralt|Did what had to be done.
Verden Peasant 02|An' if it returns?
Geralt|Ask the Ladies of the Wood to help.
Geralt|Went up the hill, took care of the problem. The details are my concern.
Verden Peasant 02|Aye, truly said. I knows naught of such things anyway.
Geralt|Not sure what was lurking there. But it lurks no more.
Verden Peasant 02|What did you do, witcher?
Geralt|An evil spirit had possessed a tree on the hill. It was responsible for the killings.
Verden Peasant 02|How'd ye dispel this evil?
Geralt|Believe me, you don't wanna know.
Verden Peasant 02|What have ye done?
Geralt|I'll look around the Whispering Hillock.
Verden Peasant 02|Ye be careful, master witcher. Don't ye treat this evil light.
Geralt|Ladies of the Wood don't know what this power is?
Verden Peasant 02|They know all. Old Thecla claimed they be punishin' us. Folk stopped respectin' 'em. Some even call 'em witches.
Verden Peasant 02|But must not be they, for they sent you.
Geralt|Solved your problem. Just in case, though, avoid the Whispering Hillock for a while.
Verden Peasant 02|Cannot be... Were somethin' lurkin' there?
Geralt|Need more details.
Verden Peasant 02|Ye must see for yourself. Me gran's mum whacked me crosswise for strayin' near the Whispering Hillock. But what happens there now's a wonder!
Verden Peasant 02|A few times folk from 'round here gathered to chop down the trees and burn the cursed soil back to use. None returned.
Verden Peasant 02|The ground 'neath the weeds is white with human bones.
Geralt|When did all this start?
Verden Peasant 02|Three year back. I remember - 'twas a warm day - went to check the snares for game.
Verden Peasant 02|Pulled a hare from me trap. It grew dark of a sudden, though it was nigh on noontime. Thought it was a storm at first.
Verden Peasant 02|A squeal pierced the air, near burst me ears. The hare rotted in my hands, and the leaves shriveled and yellowed, though it were yet the start of summer.
Verden Peasant 02|Times've been ill ever since. Folk's teeth turn black as charcoal. Womenfolk fight like polecats, bawlin' and brawlin' over nothin'.
Verden Peasant 02|The young'uns... Born crippled... Lame... Fear and cursing... Long have we pled for the Ladies' help.
Geralt|I'm supposed to help solve your problem. Tell me what it is - just the essentials.
Verden Peasant 02|The war awoke an ancient power. An evil one that feeds on bloodshed. Nightmares haunt our nights and days. Folk sleepwalk from their homes, never to return.
Verden Peasant 02|Under the tree on the Whispering Hillock they lie, unburied all: fathers, sons, daughters and mothers. Folk're afeard to move them.
Verden Peasant 02|You must go there. The dark powers must be cast off.
Geralt|Don't belong to anyone. Down to business, I want to get this done quickly.
Verden Peasant 02|Ah. So that's how it's to be.
Geralt|So, you know who sent me. Good, easier that way.
Verden Peasant 02|Forgive me... Didn't know ye came from the Ladies of the Wood.
Geralt|They help you often?
Verden Peasant 02|From the time of his Cutting, every man is theirs... They be harsh mistresses, but they're fair, just. Demanding they can be, but then nothin' in life comes easy.
Verden Peasant 02|Who drove off the plaguey airs? Who gave us seeds to plant? Round the other villages they be eatin' the soles of their boots. Whereas we? Well, we get along well enough.
Geralt|Hear about an ashen-haired woman meeting the Ladies of the Wood?
Verden Peasant 02|I ain't heard nothin' about that. Beg your question to the Ladies, and they may answer. They knows all that happens in Velen.
Geralt|They got informers?
Verden Peasant 02|The woods listen for them. A lone word at an ill hour can arouse their wrath. But they hear pleas and prayers as well.
Verden Peasant 02|Once a swineherd lost a sow, sat and cried at the crossroads. The sow ran out o' the trees, as if chased by a devil. Straight to the swineherd.
Geralt|Ever meet the Ladies of the Wood?
Verden Peasant 02|Never. They only shows themselves to the chosen. Perchance one day I too will be summoned.
Verden Peasant 02|Aye, master. I didn't know you belong to them.
Geralt|Nice village.
Verden Peasant 02|Aye.
Geralt|A real pearl of the swamps.
Verden Peasant 02|If ye say so.
Geralt|You get by all right?
Verden Peasant 02|Aye, winter to winter, somehow we survive.
Geralt|Recognize this dagger?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Who are you?
Ghost In The Tree|I abandoned my Circle... Where I'd kept the balance... The Crones killed me... And cursed my ghost…
Geralt|Never heard of a druids' circle in Velen.
Ghost In The Tree|I wander eternally through a maze of boughs... Helplessly sliding o'er rustling leaves…
Geralt|Why did they kill you?
Ghost In The Tree|The Crones want this land. They'd rule the wood alone.
Ghost In The Tree|I stood in their way… I had to die…
Geralt|You claim to be imprisoned. How so?
Ghost In The Tree|I am bound here... In fetters of magic... I wander endlessly... A labyrinth of leaves…
Ghost In The Tree|The children... I know all... I know what awaits them... Free me, please... I must help…
Geralt|If something threatens the orphans, I'll help them myself.
Ghost In The Tree|The children have been taken... Free me, please...
Ghost In The Tree|I can be a gale... A gallop unchained... I shall save them... Only I can…
Geralt|If you can save the orphans from the meadow, I'll help you.
Ghost In The Tree|I will find them… Free them…
Ghost In The Tree|Open the door of my cage… Blood is my escape…
Ghost In The Tree|A rite you must perform… With the black of raven feathers... the white of my bones... And a swift steed…
Ghost In The Tree|A mare, wild and free… in meadow's pasture caught… dark as a bottomless well… black as the depths of night… Such a beast, no other.
Ghost In The Tree|Gather these and bring them here…
Geralt|I'll gather what I need to free you. Then return.
Ghost In The Tree|Gather and return... To the hillock's depths... To the tree's rotten heart…
Ghost In The Tree|Pierce my heart... Let blood flow…
Ghost In The Tree|To be born again... I must first be consumed...
Ghost In The Tree|Go now… And return through the passage I have opened.
Geralt|Don't have any raven feathers. Gotta look around.
Ghost In The Tree|Raven nests you'll find… near Downwarren…
Geralt|Swarms of ravens attacked me not far from here. Might be some feathers on the ground or in their nests.
Ghost In The Tree|Bring the feathers of ravens... With them I'll be free…
Geralt|Got some raven feathers.
Ghost In The Tree|Find my remains... And bring me a mount…
Ghost In The Tree|A wind-born steed... A black squall turned horse…
Geralt|Why do we need a black horse?
Ghost In The Tree|The beast and I shall be as one… As when I lived... We shall be a gale... Nothing to stop us.
Ghost In The Tree|A wild steed... From meadows moist…
Geralt|Where'll I find your remains?
Ghost In The Tree|My bones… They lie in a solitary mound…
Ghost In The Tree|Nearby… due west…
Geralt|Deal. I'll help you.
Ghost In The Tree|Imprisoned for years... I shall be free again…
Ghost In The Tree|Break my fetters… Blood is my escape…
Geralt|I don't believe you, spirit. Too many claim you're evil. Your words alone - not enough.
Ghost In The Tree|Dare harm me... and against you will rise... all the powers of nature…
Geralt|I can't decide just yet.
Ghost In The Tree|You must come back... Free me... I beg you…
Ghost In The Tree|Beware my sentries… They stand guard still…
Geralt|Why do you think the kids from the meadow are in danger?
Ghost In The Tree|The sisters took them. They shall not return.
Geralt|Where'd they take them? I can help.
Ghost In The Tree|It is done already... It cannot be undone... There are no roads... To Aard Cerbin…
Ghost In The Tree|They shall all die... Let them be saved...
Geralt|The Crones? Whaddaya know about them?
Ghost In The Tree|The sisters are older than the oldest trees… Velen is their realm… All life here serves them…
Ghost In The Tree|The sisters live concealed. You will not find them. They hear all… you cannot hide.
Geralt|I was attacked.
Ghost In The Tree|This is my prison... A fortress besieged...
Ghost In The Tree|Murderers I await… And my forest protects me…
Geralt|Murderers?
Ghost In The Tree|Murderous sisters... Killed my body... Now my soul they hunt... For I defy them.
Geralt|Must know the Crones pretty well.
Ghost In The Tree|They are Velen's curse...
Ghost In The Tree|They hear all through severed ears… They weave hair and twist lives…
Ghost In The Tree|They take their strength from a broth of human flesh…
Ghost In The Tree|Why have you come...? Why spill this blood...?
Ghost In The Tree|Are you here to grant me death…? Or is my freedom your wish…?
Geralt|Didn't set out to hurt anyone. I was attacked - had to defend myself.
Ghost In The Tree|I sense no wrath…
Geralt|Didn't come here in anger.
Ghost In The Tree|Beguiled by darkness. But your heart... It is not black…
Geralt|I can hear a voice. Can't see who it belongs to, though.
Ghost In The Tree|I am but a spirit... I am but a whisper…
Geralt|Whisper to the wolves. Tell them to stay away. Who are you?
Ghost In The Tree|Once I protected them... Now they protect me… I protected this spot… from the Crones.
Ghost In The Tree|The Crones killed me… My spirit they captured… Imprisoned me in the tree...
Ghost In The Tree|Help... Aid me... Free me... I wish to be free again…
Geralt|I saw women, children even, lying dead on this hill. Did they want to destroy you?
Ghost In The Tree|To nature... To the forest and earth... All death is alike... Every death is equal…
Ghost In The Tree|I cry... I wail... None listen…
Geralt|I'm back.
Ghost In The Tree|I've been waiting... You've returned... Your decision?
Ghost In The Tree|Help... Help... Help... I long to be free once more...
Ghost In The Tree|At Aard Cerbin... Death looms for the orphans…
Ghost In The Tree|Free me, I beg you... I can help them…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|No. I should draw your blood now, let the horse drink it… but I won't.
Geralt|I don't trust you. I have to stop you, destroy you.
Ghost In The Tree|Betrayed...! Betrayed...! Betrayed...!
Geralt|Saw bodies of women and children in the woods. You've killed people who were no threat to you.
Ghost In The Tree|The wood killed them... For nature is blind... Death is never more than death…
Geralt|I don't trust you, don't believe you. I know I have to stop you, destroy your heart.
Ghost In The Tree|I will live...!
Geralt|Ready. We can start.
Ghost In The Tree|Let me fly on raven wings... Lay bones amidst the feathers…
Ghost In The Tree|Place all beneath my heart... My heart you must pierce…
Ghost In The Tree|And bring the steed...
Geralt|I offer raven feathers.
Ghost In The Tree|Once I was free... I shall be free once more…
Geralt|I offer your remains.
Ghost In The Tree|Once I was flesh... I shall be flesh once more…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Don't believe you. They say you always keep your word. So tell me everything, exactly as it happened.
Witch Brewess|We shall tell you, brave boy.
Geralt|The young woman I seek never hurt anyone without cause.
Witch Brewess|You've not seen her long. She's changed for the worse.
Geralt|Why'd she attack you?
Witch Whispess|She's no longer the girl you once knew. Wrath consumes her.
Geralt|Our deal - I did my part. Now you do yours.
Witch Whispess|A word once given we never break.
Witch Weavess|The girl... Mousy blonde - that's what they call it.
Witch Brewess|Thin as a rail - terrified, exhausted. She could barely stand, the poor thing.
Witch Whispess|We cared for her as best we could.
Witch Weavess|Like she was our own daughter.
Witch Whispess|Wasted affection. She proved a very naughty girl.
Witch Weavess|Mischievous, stubborn, and selfish.
Geralt|You used me to tame the Whispering Hillock - a lot of work.
Witch Brewess|Naught's free, brave soul.
Witch Weavess|Did you destroy the evil powers? Have you brought peace to our domain?
Geralt|Yes.
Witch Brewess|So fortunate to have found so brave a knight, so able!
Geralt|What did you need the children for?
Witch Brewess|Need? We? They needed us. Our care.
Geralt|Where are they?
Witch Whispess|They are far away.
Witch Brewess|Their troubles are over.
Witch Weavess|You exposed them to great danger.
Witch Brewess|We cannot help them! Because of you!
Witch Whispess|Leave it, sisters. Everything in its time…
Geralt|Whose spirit was trapped in the tree?
Witch Whispess|That of one who once cheated death.
Witch Brewess|But she couldn't deceive you, brave knight.
Witch Weavess|You've rid the world of a great evil.
Witch Whispess|You've freed an ancient power.
Witch Weavess|It will rise again. Elsewhere, beyond our reach. Blood will flow once more.
Witch Brewess|What foolish things men sometimes do.
Geralt|I freed the spirit trapped in the tree.
Witch Whispess|Hear that, sisters?
Witch Weavess|Traitor!
Witch Brewess|She took the children! 'Twas her!
Geralt|We made a deal. I was supposed to help the villagers. I held up my end of the bargain. They're safe now.
Witch Whispess|So, a mockery, you chose to outwit.
Geralt|You looked different in the tapestry.
Witch Whispess|We're all dressed up just for you.
Witch Brewess|If you only knew how much time we spent in front of the glass!
Witch Weavess|Do you desire us?
Geralt|I'm impressed. Polymorphism - a rare talent.
Witch Brewess|Oh, I'd suck every last drop out of you!
Witch Weavess|Ah, to be woven together with you!
Witch Whispess|I'd be your best - and last.
Geralt|Hm, not what I came for.
Geralt|You know why I'm here. You know what I want.
Witch Weavess|You shall dream of us, and return for what you reject. They always come back.
Witch Weavess|Come, it is another woman who interests you. Speak, White-Haired One.
Geralt|I know that mark. This is Anna, the wife of the baron of Crow's Perch.
Witch Weavess|She belongs to no man.
Witch Brewess|A fruit ripened in her womb. A fruit sprouted from seed sown by a man she detested.
Witch Whispess|We helped her. She agreed to serve.
Witch Weavess|She bears the mark. She is ours.
Geralt|The woman who cares for the kids…
Witch Whispess|She's a debt to pay. She is here by choice.
Geralt|She's insane.
Witch Weavess|She knew what our pact entailed when she made it.
Witch Whispess|We helped her. She promised to serve.
Witch Weavess|Now she bears our mark, belongs to us.
Witch Weavess|Never seek to cross us again.
Witch Brewess|We shall forgive you this transgression, for you've done well. Your children are plump as piglets, sweet as caramel.
Witch Whispess|But now, we must talk to our white-haired friend.
Witch Whispess|You disobeyed us once more.
Witch Brewess|We are forgiving creatures, but you - you allowed the children to escape.
Celina|They never wanted to flee. They liked it here. They played.
Witch Weavess|Your punishment must be harsh. Now silence. We must speak to the White-Haired One.
Witch Weavess|Sheathe your weapon, young man…
Witch Brewess|He's even lovelier in real life…
Geralt|Hm, in real life you're... different… than you were in the tapestry.
Witch Whispess|Well? Bring it here!
Witch Brewess|You were to bring it, not ogle it.
<|endoftext|>
Witch Brewess|We knew someone special was to arrive. We read beast entrails, saw the omens.
Witch Weavess|We would glimpse her likeness, a mirage in a puddle.
Witch Whispess|She came from the lower swamp.
Witch Whispess|We knew not at first it was her the omens had spoken of.
Witch Brewess|A child of the Elder Blood. The Sown Seed that will burst into flame…
Witch Whispess|She fell into our hands.
Witch Whispess|Elder Blood…
Witch Brewess|Mmm, the blood of the Traitoress.
Witch Brewess|Does she sleep?
Witch Whispess|Like a lamb.
Witch Brewess|Come, sisters, no point in dawdling. The table's set, the cauldron bubbles.
Witch Weavess|We cannot! You know she is meant for Him!
Witch Brewess|Imlerith will get her, he will. But not whole.
Witch Whispess|Well said. We'll just have a sample.
Witch Brewess|I'll take her feet. Lovely, hmhm, plump. Perfect for a broth.
Witch Weavess|Oooo, I can taste it already… Very well. Get on with it!
Witch Whispess|Oh, you'll regret that, girl, regret it dearly.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|You tried to kill her.
Geralt|Tried to butcher her like an animal and eat her.
Witch Brewess|Her blood, the taste brought back memories of our youth.
Witch Weavess|Elder Blood. Extraordinary girl. But you know that.
Witch Whispess|Such a shame she fled.
Geralt|You tried to kill her. Can't forgive you for that.
Witch Whispess|Waste of words.
Witch Weavess|Our fates are bound, true. But now is not the time for that to bear fruit…
Witch Brewess|Now you shall chase shadows and wander midst fog.
Witch Weavess|Each time you see her, she will be a mirage.
Witch Whispess|And if you find her - if - the girl will die… hmheh.
Witch Weavess|Be seeing you…
Witch Weavess|Handsome knight.
Witch Weavess|Heeheeheeheeheehee!
Witch Whispess|Heeheeheeheeheehee!
Witch Brewess|See you very soon.
Witch Brewess|Heeheeheeheeheehee!
Geralt|She escaped you, but I'll find her. We'll come back here together and kill you.
Witch Weavess|You'll return, you shall. Our fates are bound.
Witch Whispess|And one will die. But it shan't be one of us.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|So the peasants who went to the island for food - this lord had them murdered?
Keira Metz|The villagers say he had them poisoned.
Geralt|A real gentleman.
Keira Metz|Hm… I never met him, but he certainly didn't seem such a cruel man judging by what a mage from the isle told me.
Geralt|A mage lived on the island? Did you know him? Where is he now?
Keira Metz|We were friends. Sadly, he died that day as well. Very few survived.
Keira Metz|Yet even those who escaped the isle soon suffered agonizing deaths. Strangely, they did not seem to have been poisoned.
Geralt|All right. I'll help.
Keira Metz|I knew you'd find it irresistible! Naturally, you'll need to sail to Fyke Isle.
Geralt|Fine. What then?
Keira Metz|Well, the spirits who wander the isle - you must establish a rapport with them, don't know how. But they could point us in the direction of the curse's source.
Geralt|Think they'll be willing to chat?
Keira Metz|Of course, provided you take my magic lamp with you.
Keira Metz|I shall let you keep it afterwards, in appreciation. You'll find it quite useful, I'm sure.
Geralt|How's the lamp actually work? I mean, do I just rub it or do I have to do something, uh, magical?
Keira Metz|You needn't even rub. Just place it where you find bones and hear whispers. Ehm… I suppose I should warn you - it might not be the most pleasant experience.
Geralt|Figured as much. Tell you all about it later, maybe skip the drastic bits.
Keira Metz|You'll need to do neither. I'll give you a xenovox. It's a bauble that will let us speak over some distance.
Keira Metz|You will tell me what you see, and I shall tell you what to do and look for.
Geralt|I need to know anything else before I go?
Keira Metz|No. That is all.
Keira Metz|Oh, go already. I can't wait to see what you discover on Fyke Isle. Just be sure to come and see me afterwards. And… Geralt?
Geralt|Hm?
Keira Metz|Thank you.
Geralt|Never heard of a xenovox.
Keira Metz|It works just like a megascope, but is far more portable.
Keira Metz|Think of it as a magic box that talks.
Geralt|They hard to build?
Keira Metz|Extremely. That's why they're so rare. I certainly couldn't build anything like it.
Geralt|So, no chance these xenovoxes'll catch on, with every mage using one?
Keira Metz|Not the slightest.
Geralt|So, where'd you get the xenovox?
Keira Metz|Found it in the mine, along with the lamp.
Keira Metz|Thought it was part of the lamp at first. Didn't realize what I'd actually found until later.
Geralt|Think it belonged to the elven mage?
Keira Metz|Clearly. And I didn't even know the elves used them.
Geralt|Can't you just come with me?
Keira Metz|I tried to go to Fyke Isle once. Thought my head would burst, the curse's magic was so strong.
Geralt|Nice of you to send me there.
Keira Metz|I experienced an acute nasal hemorrhage. You stand to endure a wobble of your medallion at most.
Keira Metz|At Aretuza they trained me to detect even the subtlest magic pulses. This was like getting smacked across my haunches with a grain flail.
Geralt|Funny, thought you'd go in for that sort of thing.
Keira Metz|Take my boat. I left it on the lake shore, near the village. Should be fit to use.
Keira Metz|Provided rot hasn't eaten it, as it seems to eat everything here.
Geralt|Why're you so intent on this?
Keira Metz|I'm not, the local peasantry is. "The isle, miss! You've got to lift the charm! You're a good witch, a great witch!" There's no end to it.
Geralt|Uh-huh. See, I thought you didn't care for the locals. The great witch you are…
Keira Metz|I fail to lift the curse and they could conclude I'm not so great, not enough to conceal me from the witch hunters and risk getting sent to the gallows themselves.
Geralt|What others think, your image - that's all you care about.
Keira Metz|The point is… Listen, I didn't flee to these wilds just to stupidly get caught because some boor with grit under his fingernails grows annoyed with me.
Geralt|Need to think about it.
Keira Metz|Not too long, I trust. If you've any questions--
Geralt|…I'll know where to find you.
Keira Metz|Ughh…
Geralt|Mentioned you wanted something from me.
Keira Metz|I did. And still do. The cursed isle on Lake Wyndamer - you've heard of it, I'm sure.
Keira Metz|The local peasants mumble incessantly about it, about the wraiths that haunt it. They claim none who go there return.
Geralt|How'd it come to be cursed?
Keira Metz|That's what I don't know! I must break this spell, yet I've been unable to identify its source.
Geralt|Gotta know something…
Keira Metz|Scraps. The curse is somehow linked to the tower where Vserad, the lord of these lands, took refuge when Nilfgaard invaded.
Keira Metz|Claims in the village are that peasants, desperate of hunger, sailed to Fyke Isle to beg for food. Met their end there, it was a massacre.
Keira Metz|So, will you please help me lift this curse? You're so good at these things.
Geralt|I managed to. But while on the island, I did sense something strange. How'd it come to be cursed?
Geralt|This island that's cursed…
Keira Metz|Prepared to help after all?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Wanna talk to you about Anabelle.
Graham|Anabelle. What can you know about her?
Geralt|I met her, talked to her…
Graham|Anabelle's dead. Drank poison. And I… I couldn't save her.
Geralt|What happened on Fyke Isle? You gotta tell me.
Graham|Twere Millie, Finch and Faulkner - they rallied the men, all roughs, to go to the isle, take back what was ours from the noble.
Graham|They knew I was known at the tower, that the lord's servants would open the gate for me seein' as I sold them fish.
Geralt|They force you to go with them?
Graham|No, I… I saw my chance in it. For Anabelle and me to flee. But… it all spun into chaos. Our boys from the village, they started killin' everyone! Anabelle, they wanted to rape!
Graham|Twere then she drank the poison. Mage must've gave it 'er. I ran out the tower, hollerin' that I wanted to die, cursin' them all to hell. Don't force me to speak of it. No more, please.
Geralt|It wasn't poison. Anabelle drank a strong sleeping potion.
Geralt|Mage wanted to protect her, make it look like she was dead. Convinced everyone.
Graham|But… that means… Is she…? You said you spoke to her.
Geralt|Spoke to her ghost. By the time she awoke, tower was full of cold corpses. And rats. She was warm meat. Rats ate her alive.
Graham|You mean… she was alive the whole time? But… can't be! She was cold all through, like a corpse. I shook her, begged her, "Open yer eyes!" I never thought…
Geralt|Anabelle needs you. You can help her.
Graham|Is she still there… in the tower? Can I… see her?
Geralt|Yeah. One thing you should know, though. In death, Anabelle turned into a pesta.
Graham|A "pester?" What's that?
Geralt|More than a restless ghost. A plague maiden, a powerful wraith filled with grief and hatred that drive her, give her the power to sow disease and death.
Graham|She suffers… How am I to help her? Gods know I'm willin'.
Geralt|A curse has imprisoned Anabelle and the other spirits on the island. Love can shatter its power, free her and them.
Graham|Just as in the legends…
Geralt|If you know the legends, you know one kiss is enough to break an evil spell. On one condition - that it's a kiss from someone whose love is true.
Graham|I told you, I said I love her with all my heart! Take me to her, please.
Geralt|It's dangerous, there are risks involved. Understand that, don't you?
Graham|Course. I'm no coward, I'll not run this time.
Geralt|Nothing. Let's go.
Graham|I'm ready.
Geralt|Nothing. Meet you by the tower on Fyke Isle.
Graham|Good. I'll await you there.
Geralt|Anabelle thinks you abandoned her.
Graham|Gods! She… hates me! And all this time she's thought I ran, abandoned her?
Geralt|Yes. Go to the tower, talk to her. Maybe you can convince her that's not how it was.
Graham|I thought she'd died… I'd never have left her there otherwise!
Geralt|Anabelle needs you. Her soul will only find peace if you help her.
Graham|But… what can I do? It's too late…
Geralt|Bury her bones. Anabelle should be laid to rest by one who loved her. It's the only way to lift the curse that holds Fyke Isle.
Graham|Those are… her bones?
Geralt|Yes.
Graham|Give 'em here. And leave me be.
Geralt|It's not your fault. No guilt in not knowing - and you couldn't know it wasn't poison she drank.
Graham|Gods, what 'ave I done! If I'd a stayed behind to bury her…
Graham|I'd a noticed she was alive. It might 'ave ended different, ended well!
Geralt|If you'd stayed on the island, I doubt you'd have survived.
Graham|I'd take death over leavin' her to the rats like that!
Graham|But there's naught I can do about it now!
Geralt|Wrong on that count.
Geralt|Said you were hollering as you fled the tower, the island. What exactly did you say?
Graham|I… don't remember. I wanted them to pay - for what they'd done to her!
Geralt|Might've cursed them. There's a powerful magic aura on Fyke Isle. Passions, evil intent, strong emotions of any kind can activate it. Your words could be the curse's source.
Graham|She took the poison, because of them.
Geralt|Did you love her?
Graham|Aye, somethin' mad. Loved her so deep I believed we'd come through, believed we'd be together.
Graham|Course, 'twas not to her father's likin' - his daughter and a plain lout!
Geralt|Farewell.
Geralt|I've cleared the way to the tower. You can get there safely, go inside. Just remember - Anabelle's--
Graham|I know, you said it already! I get it.
Graham|All right. What're we waitin' for?
Geralt|I should warn you - Anabelle's changed. She'll be different, not at all like when she was alive. Could be dangerous, in fact--
Graham|She's my Anabelle, still. I'll do anythin' to help her. I'm ready to die for her, don't care a lick.
Graham|What d'you want of me?
Graham|Again…? What's it you want?
Geralt|I wanna talk.
Graham|You deaf, dammit? I told ye--
Graham|Who are ye?
Geralt|I'm a witcher.
Graham|What of it? Why should I care?
Geralt|I've been to the island. I know what happened there.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|How can I help you?
Anabelle|A curse born of hatred binds me to this place. Only love's power can hope to lift it, but… who could love a wraith?
Geralt|And your beloved - he dead, too?
Anabelle|Graham… No, he lives. I would know if he died. But he fled and abandoned me! Left me here all alone!
Geralt|Maybe you could strip the curse of its power by forgiving him. You might cleanse the isle.
Geralt|As I see it, you're the curse's focus. The other ghosts on the island - their auras aren't nearly as strong as yours.
Geralt|My medallion started pulsating as soon as we started talking.
Anabelle|I don't know what you mean, but you do seem to know some things.
Anabelle|You could be right. My fate is tied to the isle - I feel that. Perhaps because I'm heiress of these lands?
Geralt|It could be your blood ties to the land, the base of the curse, that is. If so, forgiving Graham, laying your resentment to rest, should lift it.
Anabelle|I… loved him. I'm prepared to forgive him. But I must know that he regrets what he did.
Anabelle|Take my bones to him. He must bury them. This will be our farewell. Will you speak to him? Will you do this for me?
Geralt|Fine, I'll talk to Graham. Where will I find him?
Anabelle|He lives in the village on the lakeshore. Yet… what if he's forgotten me?
Geralt|If he loved you, he'll remember. And wanna help.
Anabelle|He said he would always love me… Go to him. Make haste, please.
Geralt|Really sad story, but something's not right. Got a feeling…
Anabelle|What is it?
Geralt|You're not telling me everything. You know the island's dangerous, but refuse to tell me about the monster that lives here.
Anabelle|There is no monster!
Geralt|I think you're lying. Question is: why? To protect the beast, or is it that--
Anabelle|Stop! I will not hear this!
Geralt|I can't help you. Taking anything off this cursed island, from any cursed place - just too dangerous. And a dead woman's bones? That's asking for trouble.
Anabelle|They said witchers are heartless beasts.
Anabelle|Will you bring Graham here, then? I so long to say goodbye.
Geralt|Anabelle, listen--
Anabelle|You never wished to help me! And here I hoped someone would finally take pity on me. Stupid woman that I am!
Geralt|Really hope I can help. Need to look around first.
Anabelle|Whatever for? Naught in the tower but bones and rats. Don't leave me with them again!
Geralt|I'll come back for you. You can be sure.
Anabelle|Very well. But... come back soon. Don't keep me waiting.
Geralt|Your beloved - who is he? A noble's son?
Anabelle|No, a poor fisherman. My father objected. Strongly. He did not see us together.
Anabelle|Oh, I miss him so… Each night I walk to the island's shore to gaze upon the village. Does he remember me still?
Geralt|Hm, said before you can't leave the tower.
Anabelle|Did I? You must have misheard.
Geralt|I don't think so.
Anabelle|I… I don't know anymore. It's all a nightmare to me…
Geralt|You weren't the last to die on this island. Found a fresh corpse in the tower.
Anabelle|The island's a dangerous place. Folk should not venture here - I too wish to leave.
Geralt|The dead man - looked like a monster had attacked him. Recently. The tower home to anything else?
Anabelle|How am I to know? There's lots of wraiths here. I hear them whispering every night.
Geralt|Not talking about ghosts. A monster who hunts here. You must've noticed something…
Anabelle|I don't know! I've noticed naught - why do you ask?! Why must you press me so?! You're to be my savior, not my tormentor!
Geralt|Can you talk to the island's other specters?
Anabelle|No, I'm alone here. The others, they flee when they see me. I know not why.
Anabelle|You do not fear me, do you?
Geralt|No. Used to dealing with ghosts. Though… gotta admit, there's something about you. You're… different.
Anabelle|Will you help me now? You promised not to leave me here…
Anabelle|Why did you leave? You claimed to love me.
Anabelle|I'm cold… Why has no one come for me? I cannot leave this place, I see no way out…
Anabelle|Who are you? Do you seek to hurt me as well?
Geralt|I'm a witcher.
Geralt|I wanna lift the curse that grips this island. Your turn to tell me who you are. The other ghosts… they couldn't see me.
Anabelle|I'm special. Always was. The rare beauty. The lord's daughter. These lands, as far as the eye can see, were ours.
Anabelle|My family and I, we hid in the mage's tower, to await the war's end, the end of hard times. It was not to be forever!
Geralt|Tell me what happened here. Peasants sailed to the island to ask for food. Is that true?
Anabelle|No, they came to rob and kill! They thought us rich, believed we'd stowed ourselves away here to laugh at their misery.
Anabelle|Yet we had little food as well. Too little to share with those who came.
Anabelle|They slaughtered everyone… I heard my father cry out, but the mage told me not to reveal myself or to let anyone in.
Anabelle|He gave me a potion. If I was discovered, I was to drink it… He said everything would be all right.
Geralt|What kind of potion was it? Remember its smell, what it looked like?
Anabelle|I remember only that I feared to drink it.
Geralt|Didn't trust the mage?
Anabelle|In the village they claimed he meddled in disease. Not curing it, but causing it. They said he lured rats into the tower, infected them with the Catriona.
Anabelle|Only rumors, surely. But I was afraid, so horribly afraid…
Anabelle|And then I heard him, my beloved Graham. He called to me… I opened the door for him, but others rushed in. They lunged at me and… and…
Geralt|Did they hurt you?
Anabelle|They gripped my arms, tore at my dress… I managed to free myself and drink the potion, and then… nothing.
Geralt|Poisoned? That how you died?
Anabelle|No, for I later awoke. I was alone, it was dark. Only there were rats… everywhere. Dozens. Hundreds. And I… couldn't move.
Geralt|Sleeping potion. Effects hadn't worn off yet. You were paralyzed…
Anabelle|They were everywhere, all over me, like insects. My face, my hands… I felt them rip open my skin, then crawl into my stomach…
Anabelle|They tore me apart, and I could not even scream…
Anabelle|Have I not suffered enough? Why can't I leave this place?!
Geralt|Your beloved failed to save you? Why?
Anabelle|There were too many… "Leave her be!" he shouted. He grabbed at them, tried to stop them. They just laughed…
Geralt|What happened then?
Anabelle|Fear, terrible fear. I feared the men who approached, but I also feared the potion, drinking it.
Geralt|Mage who lived here - who was he?
Anabelle|Alexander. I hardly knew him. He spent most of his time locked away in this tower. He's dead, too, you know!
Anabelle|They're all dead! Mountains of corpses! Yet I stand here alone! All alone! They've all abandoned me, even he who promised me everlasting love. You will abandon me as well!
Geralt|If I can lift the curse, you yourself'll be free to leave.
Geralt|Don't be afraid.
<|endoftext|>
Plague Maiden|At last.
Plague Maiden|You have not forgotten. You've returned for me.
Graham|I-is-is th-that…?
Plague Maiden|Don't you recognize me? It's me, Anabelle, the one you abandoned, remember?
Graham|Anabelle, I-- I was sure ye was dead. If I'd known otherwise, I'd a never have left ye!
Graham|I'd do anythin' for ye, I would. Ye know that well. Believe me, I beg ye.
Plague Maiden|Prove it.
Plague Maiden|Kiss me.
Geralt|Graham, careful…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Fyke Isle's free of its curse.
Keira Metz|Able to persuade Graham to go to the tower with you? Did you mention there was a pesta involved?
Geralt|He knew the risks, but he'd also heard lots of stories about true love, whose kiss can break any spell. Can't help thinking that gave him courage.
Keira Metz|And? It ended well?
Geralt|Depends how you look at it. Curse is lifted, Anabelle's spirit has left in peace… but Graham's dead.
Keira Metz|Oh, poor boy. Still, he's proved that true love may be more common than some suppose.
Geralt|The lamp - what do you wanna do with it?
Keira Metz|As I said, you may keep it. I don't believe I shall need it anymore given the isle's been cleansed.
Keira Metz|I actually regret not going there with you. Perhaps we can make up for that lost time now.
Geralt|One thing's bothering me…
Keira Metz|What?
Geralt|Anabelle said Alexander was studying diseases. She mentioned "Catriona."
Geralt|You knew this?
Keira Metz|All the mages knew about it. Alexander was a highly regarded epidemiologist.
Keira Metz|I would have given anything for an opportunity to study his notes, but he guarded them jealously.
Geralt|All right. Time I was on my way.
Keira Metz|Perhaps… perhaps you'd stay just a bit longer? There's one small favor you might yet do for me.
Geralt|What is it?
Keira Metz|I put in an order for a few substances from Novigrad. The trader was due to be here yesterday, but has yet to arrive.
Keira Metz|Could you see what happened? The package is rather important to me.
Geralt|Why not. If he was coming here from Novigrad, he must've passed through Blackbough.
Geralt|I'll check the area.
Keira Metz|Thank you. I shall be ever so grateful.
Geralt|Got it all wrong, Keira. I'm not your errand boy.
Keira Metz|Oh, you're definitely no boy. You're a strong, poised witcher who will surely help a woman in need.
Geralt|Can't promise you anything, but I'll let you know if I run into him.
Keira Metz|That is all I ask.
Keira Metz|And you withheld this news until now? Why? I gave you a xenovox! But the curse - what was its source?
Geralt|The dark spell clung to the spirit of Anabelle, the lord's daughter. To free her and the isle, Graham, her beloved, had to help me.
Keira Metz|So it ended well.
Geralt|Graham just needed to bury her bones. So I'm assuming it did.
Geralt|Hm, I lifted the curse, so the island's clear. Anabelle's soul is free. Thing is, turned out she's a pesta. Graham's dead.
Keira Metz|And you failed to notice? You're losing your touch. Be that as it may, Fyke Isle is free of its curse. That's important. I'm almost inclined to say, "good work."
<|endoftext|>
Baron|A beauty? What the devil do you mean?
Verden Peasant 02|A great mare, a horse fiend… Folk done went mad, lunged at each other. Murderin' all, neighbors or young 'uns…
Geralt|It's the spirit of the forest. Taking revenge on those who sought its demise, driving them mad.
Baron|Geralt! Good you've arrived. I've trouble drawing any sense from their canting. Should give 'em a taste of the whip, to bring 'em in line, 'cause--
Verden Peasant 02|M-m'Lord, 'tis what th-they said, too! About the mare, meanin'. That it's the f-forest's dark g-ghost.
Baron|Who claimed so?
Verden Peasant 02|Th-The w-w-witch hunters. Passed through just now, headin' for the v-v-village in the swamp. S-s-some l-lass was l-l-leadin' 'em, askin' after her mother.
Baron|Lass? We must go there at once, Geralt!
Geralt|Agreed.
Baron|I'll gather my men!
Geralt|Gotta prepare.
Baron|Prepare, now? Will you shine your boots or trim your nails?
Baron|Argh, do what you will! I shall take my men and go.
Geralt|Meet you at the Crones' village.
Baron|Why the devil are there witch hunters here to start with? They didn't ride from Novigrad to hang two blobtits, did they?
Verden Peasant 02|I-I-I don't know, m'Lord.
Geralt|They say where they were headed?
Baron|Geralt! Good you've arrived. Can't draw any meanin' from this rabble's bawlin'. Perhaps they'd talk some sense after a few lashes.
Baron|Well? Spit it out - where'd they go?!
Verden Peasant 02|T-to the v-v-village in the swamp, m'Lord. Lass rode with 'em - askin' after her mother, constant.
<|endoftext|>
Baron|Tamara, dear daughter! You return after all!
Baron|Come, don't deny me this embrace…
Tamara|Stay away from me.
Tamara|I've come for mother. Unlike you, I'll not see her rot in this swamp.
Baron|Why the hell do you think I'm here? To take her home.
Tamara|Oh, you'll do no such thing. You'll not lay a finger on her. Never. I'll not let you.
Baron|You've a right to be cross… I was not the best husband, the best father, I know.
Baron|But I've changed! Ask anyone! Geralt, come, tell her!
Geralt|Your father - he wants to find his wife, your mother. Really.
Tamara|He pay you much to be his yes-man?
Graden|"Verily I say unto you that ire and vehemence can lead to naught but one's downfall."
Baron|Who the bloody hell is this?
Graden|And who are you to ask so crudely?
Tamara|This is my commander.
Graden|And that should to be of no concern to a drunken swine.
Baron|Tamara! You stand with their kind now? Perhaps you'd have them torture and hang your own father?
Tamara|You're not my father. And I care not a bit what befalls you.
Graden|A-hem. I remind you we've a matter to resolve here.
Graden|You're a witcher. Will you help?
Geralt|Wouldn't be here if I wasn't willing.
Graden|I've lost five men and have little notion of what else to expect in this cursed place.
Geralt|No time to lose. Crones could return any minute.
Tamara|Hah. How do you know they're not here already?
Geralt|Cause we're still alive.
Graden|Search the village!
Tamara|Don't!
Witch Hunter 03|Over here!
Celina|Scrubbed it good. Oy! Get back, stinky-head, gingerbread loaf, freshly baked and hot.
Tamara|Mother…
Celina|Ah, there, clean as a whistle… fresh as a daisy… Go on, whip me, I made it too little, I nibbled it, but just to see if it's firm.
Celina|But it's fresh… so take pity.
Tamara|Oh, mother…
Celina|Take pity.
Celina Monster|Hssss… hssss…
Tamara|M-m-m…
Graden|Witcher, will you help us?
Geralt|Your business. I refuse to meddle.
Tamara|Rightly so.
Geralt|Stop arguing. It's stupid. We need to find Anna.
Tamara|Witcher! Change your mind? How much did my father pay you?
Geralt|Don't think you have anything to fear. Brought your new friends with you.
Tamara|I have no fear for the Eternal Fire protects me.
Geralt|Mm, won't need to protect you from me.
Tamara|Who are you?
Geralt|Geralt of Rivia, witcher.
Tamara|We could use your kind if you'd find the heart to serve the Eternal Fire. I'm Tamara.
Geralt|Heard quite a lot about you.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Something's coming. Get ready.
Tamara|Mother?
Celina Monster|Oooooo! Aaargh!
Tamara|Huh! Is-- Is that her?
Tamara|No-- Noo… Impossible - we must do something! Witcher!
Celina Monster|Aaaaaaaarrrgghhh!
Celina|But I pleaded… I begged…
Tamara|Mother, it's me. Do you recognize me?
Tamara|Wha-- What's happened to her?
Celina|I said I'd do it all. Give it 'ere, I'll scrub it again. Scrub it clean.
Tamara|Mother!
<|endoftext|>
Tamara|Enough.
Tamara|I'm taking her away.
Baron|She's my wife. She'll return home with me. You're welcome to come with us, if you wish.
Tamara|Don't touch her! We leave this cursed place now.
Baron|She's sick, weakened… Where would you take her in this state? Oxenfurt? It would mean her death!
Tamara|I know how to care for my mother!
Graden|She's not a rag doll to be ripped from hand to hand! Let her decide!
Celina|Pie! Pie for dinner! Mud pie!
Geralt|She's incapable of deciding anything just now.
Tamara|A dark spell, it must be. Help her, witcher. I beg you.
Geralt|This is no dark spell, I'm afraid.
Tamara|Well, what is it then?
Geralt|She's been through a lot. Lost a child, was carried off by a fiend, lived in the Crones' village taking care of children who're now gone… It's left its mark, as it would on anyone.
Tamara|So it's hopeless? You can't help her? She's to be like this?
Geralt|I'm sorry.
Baron|I know a hermit, a very wise man with a gift for healing. Met him some time past. Lives in the Blue Mountains. I shall take her there.
Geralt|Might be worth a shot.
Tamara|I shall go with you.
Graden|That's impossible, sadly.
Tamara|Why?
Graden|You have duties, duties deriving from your commitment to the Church of the Eternal Fire. Once we finish our work in Velen, we return to Oxenfurt.
Tamara|You said you'd save my mother!
Graden|And I kept my word. Your father can care for her now.
Tamara|He, care? You know him! You know what he did to her!
Graden|He swears to be a changed man. And in his eyes I see true sorrow, remorse for his sins. He will care for her. And you've a new life, and new duties - to the Eternal Fire.
Baron|Fear not, all will be well.
Baron|I will not touch drink. I will find the hermit. And once she is herself again, we will find you.
Tamara|Swear it.
Baron|You have my word, child.
Tamara|Thank you, witcher. Despite all.
Graden|May the Eternal Fire guide and protect you.
Geralt|Farewell.
Geralt|It's no use. Doubt a healer can do anything for her now. Doubt anyone can.
Baron|I must do something!
Geralt|Before we do anything, we've gotta get her out of here. Crones know we've come for her. Might send another monster, something worse than a fiend.
Tamara|I'll not go anywhere until you tell me you can help her, break the spell.
Baron|What was that?
Graden|Looked a fiend to me.
Geralt|Crones've sensed us, they know we're close. Sent the beast for Anna.
Tamara|Those damned witches! When will it end?! Look what they've done to her! Are they not satisfied?!
Tamara|Just look at her…
Tamara|Witcher, you know of these things, you must. What… what's wrong with her?
Geralt|Last I was here, she was nothing like this. Crones must've cursed her.
Graden|Can you lift this curse?
Geralt|Not till I know what it is.
Tamara|She can't have lived here alone. Perhaps there's someone else, someone who saw something…
Geralt|Maybe Johnny…
Graden|Who?
Geralt|Err… A boy. A hermit. Lives in the swamp. Came around here from time to time. He mighta seen something.
Graden|We must find him.
Geralt|Doesn't like strangers. You wait here. I'm better off going alone.
Geralt|Easy. Shouting won't help. Calm down.
Tamara|Simple for you to say! How can I?! That's my mother, understand?!
Graden|He's on our side. Let him think.
Graden|Witcher, do you know what is wrong with the woman?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Johnny, wake up.
Godling Johnny|What? Who? Oh, witcher. You frightened me. Thought it were those vile hags.
Geralt|Killed a few near your den.
Godling Johnny|The Crones sent them. To punish me.
Geralt|Remember that crazy old woman who looked after the kids?
Godling Johnny|Gran? Sure I remember.
Geralt|Found her in the Crones' village. Transformed into a monster. Any idea how that happened?
Godling Johnny|By happenstance, Gran mixed some poppy seed and ash. Went by to help her sort it out. Mother nature gave me small hands, see, so I can do it easy like.
Godling Johnny|Workin' away we was, separatin' seeds from dust… Out of nowhere, Gran cried out! The mark on her hand started glowin'! She yelled at me to hide.
Godling Johnny|I crawled into a chest. Barely had time to blink before the Crones tottered in. The Weavess snipped a lock of Gran's hair. Called it punishment for lettin' the children escape. Then the hags opened the door in the floor. Went down, down, down - shame it weren't all the way to hell.
Geralt|Stay in the chest until the Crones left?
Godling Johnny|Wanted to. "Sit tight and quiet," said to meself. "Not a peep out your beak till they go." But then Gran fell to the floor. Started screaming and tearing her hair out.
Godling Johnny|Didn't know what to do. So I leapt out of the chest. Thought herbs might help her - the ones she cured the children's aches with. But Gran was no longer herself. She was a beast.
Geralt|So? You give her the herbs?
Godling Johnny|Couldn't manage it - the Crones came back. I dropped to my knees and begged 'em to spare Gran. Brewess piped up first.
Godling Johnny|"Naughty boy, oh naughty. Shouldn't say 'no' when the sisters want to hear 'yes.'"
Godling Johnny|Then the Whispess says, "Run, boy, run, before your legs rot off." They all laughed - and I legged it.
Geralt|There's something in that cellar. The key to finding out what happened to Gran, I think.
Godling Johnny|Will you help her?
Geralt|Provided it's not too late.
Geralt|Thanks, Johnny. And good luck to you.
Godling Johnny|Likewise. And if you happen on any water hags, give 'em a nice, fat walloping on me behalf. Farewell, witcher.
Geralt|You escaped. Consider yourself lucky.
Godling Johnny|I do. But I've not lost the Ladies for long. If I'm to live, I must hide, and I can forget my cozy hole. It's the first place they’ll look if they set out to nab me.
Geralt|Try deeper in the swamp, maybe?
Godling Johnny|Argh. I suppose I must. And what will you do?
Geralt|Take a look under the door?
Godling Johnny|I look like a fool to you?
Geralt|No. You do look like the inquisitive type, though.
Godling Johnny|My inquisitiveness ends where folly begins.
Geralt|Went down there - the cellar under the house.
Godling Johnny|And? What'd you find?
Geralt|Lots of cobwebs, strange objects, something like an altar on the wall…
Godling Johnny|Oooh, that's enough for me. Needn't know anymore, nor do I want to.
Geralt|Why'd the Weavess need Gran's hair? Any idea?
Godling Johnny|The Crones take folks' ears to hear all. Hair gives 'em power over folks' lives.
Godling Johnny|There are times they weave the hair into odd strings. Other times they take it downstairs.
Geralt|So you saw what happened to Gran?
Geralt|Get on the Crones' bad side?
Godling Johnny|I told 'em off, and they don't like it when you tell 'em off.
Geralt|Why'd you do it?
Godling Johnny|Wanted to help Gran. She's always been good to the children. Would've been the doldrums out here without 'em, she'd 'ave died of boredom. Begged the Crones not to hurt Gran, but they were angry she'd let the children escape.
<|endoftext|>
Tamara|Did you learn anything?
Geralt|Just as I thought - the Crones probably cursed your mother. Took a lock of her hair, then disappeared down the stairs. Cellar under the house, cellar door's hidden.
Graden|In that case, we've no time to lose. Come.
Geralt|Lemme go in first. Give you a shout if I find anything interesting.
Graden|So be it. Let's begin.
Geralt|Been down there. Creepy place. I should go first.
Geralt|I work alone.
Graden|This matter concerns us all.
Geralt|We don't know what's in there. Your men'll make a lot of noise, more than I'll make alone.
Graden|I am the Church of Eternal Fire's agent in these lands. It is my duty to go with you.
Geralt|Fine… Just you, then. The rest stay here with Anna.
<|endoftext|>
Graden|By the Eternal Fire… I've never seen so many before.
Geralt|Looks unsavory. What is all this?
Graden|The trappings of a black magic ritual. Witches weave human hair through dolls they first curse. They gain a grasp on individuals' souls this way.
Geralt|Think one of the dolls represents Anna? Can we free her if we find it?
Graden|It's the only way I know of, but there are risks involved. The items woven into the dolls - see them?
Graden|They symbolize the individuals the dolls are meant to represent. We must find the doll that is Anna and take it from here.
Geralt|This risk you mentioned - take it we only get one shot at choosing the right doll?
Graden|I'll not chance it. I did not know Anna… You've learned much of her. Should find it easier to choose.
Geralt|All right. Let's take a look at these dolls.
Geralt|Hm, red bead attached to this one. Anna wears a string of those around her neck.
Graden|As do half the women from Novigrad to Vengerberg. This cannot be the one.
Geralt|And I think it is. I'm taking this doll.
Graden|It's Anna!
Graden|What have you done?!
Geralt|Hm, all right. I'll look at the others.
Geralt|Hm, bird feathers woven into this one… If I had to bet on it, I'd say this doll represented Philippa.
Graden|Philippa Eilhart? If that's true, then--
Geralt|Relax, first name that came to mind, that's all. Philippa's way too clever for the Crones to have snared her in some trap.
Geralt|Besides, we're not here for Philippa, we're here to save Anna. And I can't think of any link between her and bird feathers.
Graden|That might seem obvious… but what if it's a ruse, and this doll, in fact, symbolizes Anna?
Geralt|Could be true… Fine, I'm taking this one. Sure as hell hope you're right.
Graden|As do I.
Geralt|Doubtful. Crones'd have no reason to employ trickery here.
Geralt|Should look at the others.
Geralt|Hm… this is interesting.
Graden|A doll with a flower? What's so interesting in that?
Geralt|Not just any flower - a violet hollyhock. Baron once told me it was Anna's favorite flower.
Graden|Hm. You believe this to be the doll?
Geralt|I'm sure it is. Taking it.
Graden|Quick! Outside!
Geralt|Might very well be, but I can't be sure.
Geralt|Human ear attached to this one.
Graden|Belonged to one of the peasants, doubtless. Anna still has both her ears.
Geralt|Let's look at the others.
Geralt|Seem to know a lot about this.
Graden|From tomes on black magic. Initially, we burned any that we found. Recently we decided it might be wise to read them first.
Geralt|Poisoning your minds with magic, heh, superstition? What's the hierarch think of that?
Graden|Have you met the man?
Geralt|No.
Graden|Neither have I.
<|endoftext|>
Tamara|What have you done?
Tamara|You were to save her! She burst into flames, hear me?! My mother burned alive!
Geralt|This was a cursed place. Anna herself was cursed. This is the best we could do for her. She's better off dead.
Tamara|You bastard!
Tamara|And you! Will you just stand there?! You hired this murderer!
Tamara|Have you nothing to say?! Did you care that little for her? Not even… not even a single tear…!
Graden|Come. Let us go.
Graden|This might've been done differently. We could have avoided this. I'm certain of it.
Graden|Naught left for us here. We ride for Oxenfurt!
Graden|Don't cry, child. The Eternal Fire will soothe your pain. Open your heart, take comfort in its warmth.
Baron|Come to Crow Perch for your pay.
Geralt|Made a mistake. Clearly chose the wrong doll.
Tamara|You made a mistake? A mistake?!
Graden|You knew there were risks. You might have thought it through!
Geralt|Someone had to choose.
Tamara|Too damn bad that someone was you!
Tamara|And you! Will you just stand there?! You hired this murderer!
Tamara|Have you nothing to say?! Did you care that little for her? Not even… not even a single tear…!
Graden|Let us leave this place.
Baron|Come to Crow Perch for your pay.
Geralt|I'm sorry. Didn't know it would end this way.
Tamara|You're sorry? You're sorry?!
Tamara|And you! Will you just stand there?! You hired this murderer!
Tamara|Have you nothing to say?! Did you care that little for her? Not even… not a single tear…!
Graden|Come. Let us go.
<|endoftext|>
Tamara|Mum, you're back! All will be well, you're going to be fine.
Celina|Tammy… I'm dying…
Baron|She's not well, ravin'. Doesn't rightly know what's happenin'…
Baron|You're weak yet. You must rest.
Celina|No, listen to me… The Crones… I was to be their beast to the end, forever. You broke their spell, but now I must go.
Tamara|Wh-What's she talking about, witcher?!
Geralt|Hmm… The Crones deceived us. Their curse is a death sentence. No way to lift it, at least not in a way that would let Anna live.
Geralt|We broke their spell temporarily, partly. Now it's gotta run its course.
Tamara|What?! What does that mean?!
Baron|She's dying.
Celina|It's good… to see you together…
Baron|I'm sorry, Annie. For everything… I'm sorry.
Tamara|Mother…
Celina|Tammy… Do you remember? That day on the Ina…?
Tamara|Of course. Those plums were so sweet, your dress so blue… You wove me a wreath of flowers. We laughed the day away.
Celina|Please… Remember me like that.
Tamara|Noooo!
Graden|I thank you. They had a chance to say goodbye. That was your doing.
Geralt|Shame I couldn't do more.
Graden|Come, child. The Eternal Fire will soothe your pain.
Baron|Leave me be. Your pay will await you at Crow Perch. Collect it there.
Geralt|Nothing we can do to help her.
Baron|But we… No! That's impossible!
Celina|Dear daughter… Phillip…
<|endoftext|>
Baron Bandit Strong 02|You'll shut your trap if you want this to be done soon! The man needs to concentrate.
Verden Peasant 03|You're whoresons, all!
Baron Bandit Strong 02|I said shut it.
Baron Bandit Strong 02|What you lookin' at? Wanna be next for a thrashin'?
Geralt|What's going on here?
Verden Peasant 03|Sir, me daughter… Help us!
Baron Bandit Strong 02|My men need some diversion from time to time. They get jumpy elsewise.
Geralt|I can't let this happen. I won't.
Baron Bandit Strong 02|Figured it might end this way.
Baron Bandit Strong 02|Get him!
Geralt|This is just not my business.
Baron Bandit Strong 02|Clever man, clever man. You'd fit right in if you cared to join us.
<|endoftext|>
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Where's your gold? You can tell us willingly or…
Verden Peasant 02|No! Please… We've none left!
Verden Peasant 02|Sir, help us!
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Stay out of this.
Geralt|Leave them alone.
Baron Bandit Strong 01|What's it to you?
Geralt|Won't stand by and watch you rob and murder them. Plain refuse to.
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Got a sensitive one. Look away, woman.
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Still here?
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Oy! Get him!
Geralt|Fair enough. Not my business.
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Now fuck off and leave us to ours.
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Shoulda talked when I asked nicely, but nooo… We'll ploughin' find the coin ourselves, you stupid hick.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What the hell happened?
Sergeant|Hanged himself. Plain enough to see.
Geralt|Was he drunk?
Sergeant|Yeah… Always knew the hooch'd be his end.
Sergeant|Lost everythin' he cared for. No surprise he lost the will to live.
Geralt|Don't look too concerned, you and your boys.
Sergeant|What would you have us do - sit and wail?
Sergeant|Baron was a good soldier. But settlin' in here at Crow's Perch - it made him soft. We'll introduce a new order, things'll be different now.
Geralt|I imagine they will.
Geralt|Himself, or did you boys help him?
Sergeant|Who the fuck do you take me for, a murderer?
Sergeant|He was what he was, a right bastard. But I respected him.
<|endoftext|>
Guslar|Ask a service of the witcher, the pellar must. A witcherly service, that's to say…
Geralt|What do you need, tell me.
Guslar|A man who fears no evil, the pellar needs…
Guslar|Forefathers' Eve is nigh, we've rites to conduct. Wandering souls to emerge, damned souls, too. We've the circle to protect from these wretches.
Geralt|Seems like you could use a witcher - so, yeah, I'll help.
Guslar|You'd not refuse, the pellar knew. The time's come to gather the folk.
Guslar|Across the lake, we must journey - to Fyke Isle. There, in the circle of stones, we shall meet.
Geralt|What'll I get out of it?
Guslar|Witchers do naught for free, this the pellar knows. Not to fear. How to reward one for their aid - this too the pellar knows.
Geralt|Why hold the ritual at all?
Guslar|Atimes men die choking with regret, atimes death takes them afore they've tasted any bitterness in life. These poor souls, unfulfilled, cannot leave this vale of tears.
Guslar|Their spirits wander 'midst the living… must be judged, sent on their way. This we do on Forefathers' Eve.
Geralt|Can't help you just now.
Guslar|But we alone cannot keep evil at bay! There's a war on. Men's blood soaks the earth. The damned o'er it wander in great numbers.
Guslar|Ponder it. The pellar will pay ye. Should ye need him, the pellar in his hut ye'll find.
Geralt|Said already I won't help. Gonna have to make do without me.
Guslar|Not good, not good. No Forefathers' Eve this year, it means, the horror. Should your mind ye change, the pellar in his hut you'll find.
Geralt|Mentioned Forefathers' Eve earlier.
Guslar|The spirits' feast. You wish to see? You'll help the pellar?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Greetings.
Guslar|Just in time.
Guslar|Good folk! Behold the one who will protect us! Ye needn't fear!
Guslar|Soon shall we summon the wandering souls. Beyond all help some will be. From these you must protect us.
Guslar|Evil creatures keep at bay, keep at bay till the ritual's done.
Geralt|Begin.
Guslar|Keep us from harm, and let them not disturb the circle.
Geralt|Need some time to prepare.
Guslar|A must is a must.
Guslar|Are you ready?
<|endoftext|>
Guslar|What is this life? Well ye know…
Chorus Eve|Fleeting torment ere we go.
Guslar|What comes next, once life subsides…
Chorus Eve|Man his own fate decides.
Guslar|Soon will rise thy dead, thy buried…
Chorus Eve|Each will say by what they're harried.
Guslar|Will ye grant these souls reprieve?
Chorus Eve|We're prepared to end their grief!
Guslar|Let's begin Forefathers' Eve!
<|endoftext|>
Witch Hunter 01|Begone, foul force! I cast upon you the light of the Eternal Fire!
Witch Hunter 01|Abomination! Stop this at once!
Guslar|The errant souls… we must help them…
Witch Hunter 02|Silence! I'll not tolerate necromancy!
Guslar|Help me.
Geralt|Leave now. You're disrupting the ritual.
Witch Hunter 01|This is black magic, these folk disturb the dead. We cannot allow it, we will not.
Geralt|You don't know a thing about their customs.
Witch Hunter 01|Take him! And disperse the others!
Geralt|Here to fight monsters, not humans.
Witch Hunter 01|We've no quarrel with you. Begone.
Witch Hunter 01|Scatter this rabble to the four winds! Don't spare the whip!
Guslar|Hark! A sound I hear! 'Tis right? A spirit breaks the still of night!
Chorus Eve|Burn the incense ever higher! Spirit, join us 'round the fire!
Guslar|Spirit - speak! This time is yours! Tell us of your ghostly woes!
Verden Peasant 04|Tis old man Ambros!
Geralt|Should I drive him away?
Guslar|Nay.
Verden Peasant 03|I've come for you, patricide.
Geralt|Who are you?
Verden Peasant 03|He knows.
<|endoftext|>
Guslar|Tis an ill turn, ill… Woe are we.
Guslar|Blood has stained the hallowed ground.
Guslar|Yet… we cannot stop what has begun.
Geralt|If you wanna continue, I'm ready.
Guslar|Good folk, we must the Eve complete! Prepare yourselves!
Guslar|Ye we summon, ye we call. Enter, souls, we'll judge ye all.
Chorus Eve|All is quiet, all is gloom. What beings in the darkness loom?
Guslar|Something whispers, something peeps. Someone near our fire creeps.
Chorus Eve|All is quiet, all is gloom. What beings in the darkness loom?
Guslar|Wraiths!
Guslar|This sacred ground is with blood stained. We cannot the ritual complete!
Guslar|People! Save yourselves! If your lives you value, run!
Geralt|The bloodshed - it do any harm?
Guslar|Tainted lies the circle now. They who thirst for the gore of men shall come.
Guslar|Gods willing, they will be few, and the pellar shall finish the rite.
Guslar|Begone! Away with you!
Guslar|This is hallowed ground!
<|endoftext|>
Guslar|Alas. All is lost.
Geralt|Hm. Gotta be a peasant who told the Witch Hunters about the ritual.
Geralt|That spirit they drove away - your father's ghost, right? Threatened to come back, likely to keep his word.
Guslar|Old man Ambros the pellar fears not.
Geralt|You can't hope to manage this alone. You're afraid, that's clear. Wraith'll hold sway over you.
Geralt|Listen, I'll send him off, I've got to. But I need to know where he's buried. Corpse probably hasn't turned to dust yet - that's his bond to the world of the living.
Guslar|Ambros… lies in the swamp.
Geralt|Fine, I'll find his body. See what I can do.
Geralt|That wraith called you a patricide. He get it right?
Guslar|Aye.
Geralt|If I'm gonna help you, I gotta know everything. Why'd you kill your father?
Guslar|The pellar does not wish to speak of this.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Found your father's body. Had to burn it.
Guslar|Good you did. Return for me he would 'ave.
Geralt|Ghost's not likely to come back.
Guslar|Thank you, witcher. A reward for your aid.
Guslar|And if herbs or remedies you ever need, for near nothing you will have them from me.
Geralt|What's your story? You actually kill your father?
Guslar|Twas an evil man. The pellar feared him once, but then grew brave.
Guslar|What his father did to his mother… the pellar could not look upon it.
Guslar|So he split the father's head with an axe. Left him in the swamp… But folk knew…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|So. Found what you were looking for?
Keira Metz|Yes, thanks for asking. How are you feeling? Sleep well?
Geralt|What do you want with those papers?
Keira Metz|Why, I aim to use them to continue important work that a man's tragic death put on hold.
Keira Metz|Alexander was studying the Catriona plague. I'll use his notes to produce medication, perhaps a cure… or at least a vaccine.
Geralt|Mhm. Strictly humanitarian motivations, is that it?
Keira Metz|No. Strictly selfish ones.
Keira Metz|The mighty would pay willingly for such a remedy. Can you imagine how much? Take Radovid, for instance. Why, he might even consider forgetting my past associations with the Lodge.
Geralt|You're either incredibly gullible… or you're trying to play me again.
Keira Metz|Whatever do you mean?
Geralt|Radovid has one objective - to defeat Emhyr. Curing Catriona, stopping the plague, won't help him do that. So he'll either burn you at the stake with those notes among the kindling… or he'll make you use them - to create a weapon.
Keira Metz|Don't be ridiculous. Bacteria cannot be controlled.
Geralt|Not yet… But it's possible in theory, isn't it?
Keira Metz|In theory it's just as possible for a dachshund to impregnate a she-wolf.
Keira Metz|I don't have time to debate this, Geralt. I'm going to see Radovid, whether you like it or not.
Geralt|Thousands of lives in exchange for your amnesty… Might seem a fair price to you. Not to me.
Keira Metz|I'll not give you these notes. I'll not give you anything.
Geralt|Please… Don't make me…
Keira Metz|Shut up and draw your sword.
Geralt|It's your conscience, but you do know hundreds… thousands could die.
Keira Metz|What of it? What difference will it make if Nilfgaard's legions die by steel or because of some fucking germs? None!
Geralt|A plague can go wrong, go wild. A sword won't. That's the difference.
Keira Metz|Shut up for a moment and look at me.
Keira Metz|See this? Bedbugs, Geralt. Bloody bedbugs! I, Keira Metz, advisor to Foltest and member of the Lodge of Sorceresses, have bedbugs!
Keira Metz|Think what you will, but I'll not stay in this bloody swamp one day more. Not one day!
Keira Metz|I shall cross the Pontar, and that means Radovid's men will find me sooner or later. Don't you understand?! I don't have a choice. I will have to parley.
Geralt|Got another option. Go to Kaer Morhen.
Keira Metz|You believe I'd be safe there?
Geralt|Long as you don't piss Lambert off, yes. Emhyr, Radovid - neither'll be able to reach you. Find little in the way of luxury there, but we do have clean sheets.
Keira Metz|It's a long way, well beyond the dividing line. But if I keep to the woods until I reach the Kestrel Mountains, I should pass through unnoticed.
Keira Metz|So be it. Seems I find it hard to refuse you, handsome. You've clearly a notion of what women want, how they think.
Geralt|So, see you at Kaer Morhen? Beds free of bedbugs… mostly.
Keira Metz|I long to be there already… See you, Geralt.
Geralt|Yeah, kinda… So before I go, I'll need you to hand me those notes.
Keira Metz|All right, all right. Take them already.
Keira Metz|Farewell, Geralt. Or rather, see you soon.
Geralt|No. The opposite. When I get there with Ciri, I expect we'll have to battle the Wild Hunt.
Keira Metz|Unbelievable! Have you even been listening to me?
Geralt|Closer than you think. You're not looking for safety. You want your dignity back. You wanna be Keira Metz, sorceress of the Lodge, not some healer from the swamps who reeks of manure.
Geralt|Giving you an opportunity Radovid won't give you. Go to Kaer Morhen. Show everyone what you're made of.
Keira Metz|Yennefer was right. You do have some notion of what women want, how they think.
Geralt|Expect me to pity you…? Because of some bedbugs? You're joking, right?
Keira Metz|They… They truly did leave you heartless. Get out of my sight.
Geralt|I'll go soon as you hand me those notes.
Keira Metz|Then you shall stay here forever…
Geralt|Fine. Farewell, Keira… Here's hoping Radovid rolls out the red carpet for you.
Keira Metz|Shove your sarcasm up your arse.
Geralt|I'm not one to judge… Whatever you think is right.
Keira Metz|Farewell, Geralt of Rivia. I hope… I truly hope you find your Ciri.
Geralt|So you're fine assisting in genocide? That doesn't strike you as incredibly wrong? Really?
Geralt|I can't believe we fucked…
Keira Metz|Yen won't either when I tell her… Or Triss. Sorry, lost track of who you're currently obsessed with.
Keira Metz|We're done talking, Geralt. Get out of my sight.
Geralt|Radovid'll use you. Make you history's villain, the scapegoat. But if that's what you want…
Keira Metz|Yes, that's exactly what I want. So stop lecturing me and leave me alone. Farewell and a pleasant journey to you.
Geralt|Radovid doesn't forget, and Radovid doesn't forgive. Especially when it comes to sorceresses.
Keira Metz|He'll make an exception for me. He'll have to. I have something he wants.
Geralt|Please, you don't believe that.
Keira Metz|Well, you believe Yennefer will stop treating you like a dog someday. Don't see me laughing.
Keira Metz|I'm going to see Radovid, tell him of this research, whether you like it or not.
Geralt|We can't allow this research to fall into the wrong hands… And Radovid's are as wrong as they come.
Geralt|This is suicide, Keira. You'll wind up tied to a stake, burned to bolster the morals of the masses while entertaining them.
Geralt|But it's your life. Gonna hand it to Radovid? Well, quick and painless - hope he grants you that in return, at least.
Keira Metz|Cute. Thank you, I guess… All the best to you as well.
Geralt|You used me.
Keira Metz|Oh, please… I merely seized an opportunity.
Geralt|If I'd known you just wanted Alexander's notes, I'd never have helped you lift the curse from Fyke Isle.
Keira Metz|All right, perhaps I wasn't completely honest, didn't quite toe the line. But I knew you'd manage - you're so manly and all…
Keira Metz|Geraltie-pooh… wipe that frown off your face, or I might think you don't like me anymore.
Geralt|I don't… You're a vile, two-faced, four-tongued viper.
Keira Metz|Aha! Ho, ho… And I always took you for a gentleman.
Geralt|All jokes aside - what're you gonna do with those notes?
Keira Metz|Do you really believe you can call me names and then revert to polite conversation just like that?
Keira Metz|Get out of my sight… Before I give in to my urge to teach you some manners.
Geralt|All right. Don't have time to argue with you. Do what you want.
Keira Metz|I need neither your permission nor your blessing. Get out.
Keira Metz|Oh, Geralt… shame you didn't talk that way when we fucked.
Geralt|Didn't come here to play games. I wanna know what you're up to.
Keira Metz|Naturally, you suspect me of the worst. I don't deserve that. My intentions are pure - like a virgin's tears.
Geralt|Right on that count - I don't like this.
Geralt|Keira. I can't-- I won't let you do this.
<|endoftext|>
Cirilla|Da-hah. It's not working, don't you see?!
Avallach|Discouraged after a mere eight attempts? Zireael…
Cirilla|How many times must I try?
Avallach|As many as it takes.
Cirilla|But I'm not getting anywhere.
Avallach|We shall return to this later.
Geralt|Didn't make it far first time out on the Gauntlet, either.
Cirilla|Geralt, please. Not now.
Cirilla|By comparison, the Gauntlet was a walk in the park. But that's not the point.
Geralt|What is?
Cirilla|Avallac'h says nothing will come of this until I stop thinking about the battle.
Cirilla|But at the moment I find it impossible to fill my head with kittens and vanilla pudding.
Cirilla|Tell me… How do you do it?
Geralt|What?
Cirilla|Always manage to pull yourself together, focus, no matter what's happening?
Geralt|Hmm, don't know about vanilla pudding. Could work, but nothing picks me up like Lambert's famous homebrew.
Cirilla|Suppose it can't kill me. Might as well try…
Geralt|Hmm, there's a certain ancient method. Vesemir taught it to me, and Barmin taught it to him.
Cirilla|Will you take me into the mountains and make me drink hemlock?
Geralt|The Skellige druids have used it for centuries. It always works…
Cirilla|Heeey!
Cirilla|You'll regret that!
<|endoftext|>
Cirilla|Ha-ha! Geralt of Rivia, defeated! Need to work on those dodges.
Geralt|Sure I didn't let you win?
Cirilla|Sure you're not smarting from a defeat by a true maestro? Heheh.
Cirilla|You were right. That really works!
Cirilla|Thanks.
Geralt|Glad to be of service.
Geralt|So what now?
Cirilla|I'll go see where our dearest Sage is…
Cirilla|Hahaha!
<|endoftext|>
Cirilla|Geralt! Geeeraaalt!
Cirilla|Wake up!
Geralt|Wha… what? What's happening?
Cirilla|Get up, we must go. I've saddled the horses.
Geralt|Ciri, it's the crack of dawn. Where do you wanna go?
Cirilla|To Velen. Bald Mountain. But a few days till the witches' sabbath.
Cirilla|And guess who's the guest of honor.
Geralt|Dunno, enlighten me.
Cirilla|Imlerith.
Cirilla|We'll have no better chance to get him.
Geralt|Where'd you get this idea? What's gotten into you?
Cirilla|I must avenge Vesemir.
Cirilla|The sabbath - it's the perfect opportunity. Imlerith will be drunk, among his cohorts, caught up in the revelry. He'll not expect the blow.
Geralt|Ciri… Sure you know what you're getting into?
Cirilla|Yes. And I must do this.
Cirilla|Come, we shall talk on the way.
Geralt|Wait, something I gotta tell you before we go.
Geralt|You know the emperor really wanted you found?
Cirilla|Yennefer… mentioned something.
Geralt|Wanted you to visit him.
Cirilla|Why would you tell me now?
Geralt|Cause this could be your last chance to see your… father.
Cirilla|Think I should go?
Geralt|Probably just wants to talk.
Cirilla|How can you be sure? What if he wants something more?
Geralt|Promised me he wouldn't force you to do anything.
Cirilla|So I should go?
Geralt|He is your father…
Cirilla|Vizima is on the way. I suppose we can drop in.
Geralt|Ahh. You don't look good in black.
Cirilla|What do you mean?
Geralt|Think he wants to meet you because he missed you? As I see it, he's got plans for you.
Cirilla|Ugh. Might've expected it…
Cirilla|Geralt, I'm fed up. I won't have others deciding for me behind my back. We ride for Velen.
Geralt|Oughta decide for yourself.
Cirilla|But I want your opinion - should I go or not?
Geralt|Lead on.
Geralt|Why do I doubt Avallac'h's a fan of this idea?
Cirilla|Do you see him here? I left him a letter, we'll rejoin him in Novigrad.
Geralt|How'd you learn all this? Imlerith, the sabbath…
Cirilla|Avallac'h. He told me of those who chase us. Claims knowledge itself can tip the scales.
Geralt|Don't know and don't really care, to tell you the truth.
Geralt|After this training with Avallac'h, we were gonna ride to Novigrad. Remember?
Cirilla|Change of plans. Imlerith will be at the sabbath. We'll get him there.

Geralt|Thanks.

Emhyr|Now forgive me. I wish to speak to my daughter.
Chamberlain Emhyr|Follow me, sir.
Geralt|Didn't come to collect on a deal. You asked me to bring your daughter here. I did just that.
Geralt|Ciri will hear you out. Then we leave.
Emhyr|Are you sure?
Emhyr|Never again would you need to stalk monsters while wading through sewage.
Geralt|I'm sure.
Emhyr|I understand. Honor prevents you from accepting coin.
Emhyr|In that case, a stallion, a throroughbred Nilfgaardian, awaits you in the stables. Treat it as an expression of my gratitude.
Geralt|Thank you.
Chamberlain Emhyr|Your Imperial Majesty, Geralt of Rivia and…
Emhyr|Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon, Queen of Cintra, Princess of Brugge and Duchess of Sodden, heiress to Inis Ard Skellig and Inis An Skellig, and suzeraine of Attre and Abb Yarra.
Emhyr|Get used to it. Before long every soul from Nilfgaard to the Dragon Mountains will kneel before you.
Emhyr|I did not expect you to keep your word, witcher.
Geralt|I always keep my word.
Emhyr|As do I.
Emhyr|Your reward.
Geralt|Ciri wanted to hear what you have to say.
Emhyr|And she will.

Voorhis|White Wolf! Good to see you!
Geralt|Greetings, General.
Voorhis|You had no trouble crossing the Pontar, I trust?
Geralt|None.
Voorhis|I take it you crossed via the ford near Ban Gleán.
Voorhis|It's fortunate you did not choose to ride through Rinde. A troubled region, still. Radovid seeks to breach the front in the west.
Voorhis|But he'll not succeed. Not before the princess becomes empress and we bring order to the area.
Geralt|Of course.
Voorhis|While we're on the subject, how is our future ruler? Must admit I'm curious how she'll react when she hears the throne will be hers. I venture to say she'll be delighted…
Geralt|You never know…
Voorhis|Yes, of course, she's tactful, not one to celebrate an offer not yet made… But this is not the kind of offer one refuses.
Geralt|Indeed.
Voorhis|Can you imagine? I thought only the wine-addled minds of bards and poets could give birth to such stories.
Voorhis|The prodigal daughter of the most powerful ruler in the Continent's history returns, on the eve of his final triumph, to embrace her inheritance.
Voorhis|Simpletons adore such stories - as they do the princesses, ever beautiful and delicate, who are their--
Geralt|Isn't it?
Voorhis|Do you know any who would not like to be emperor of Nilfgaard?
Geralt|Ciri hasn't agreed to that yet.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Well?
Cirilla|If he thinks he can buy me, he is sorely mistaken.
Geralt|He offer anything specific?
Cirilla|Yes, very specific. And thoroughly absurd.
Cirilla|Sorry. I don't want to talk about it. Not now, at least.
Geralt|Won't pressure you. When you're ready. Let's go.
Cirilla|By the way, that spectacle with the coin - what was that?
Geralt|Emperor's got lots. Couldn't see why he shouldn't share some with us.
Cirilla|Is that what this was about - from the start?
Geralt|No. It's always been about you. Only you.
Cirilla|It sure seemed like it was about the coin in there.
Geralt|Ciri, I…
Cirilla|If it wasn't, you shouldn't have accepted it.
Cirilla|Say no more. I'll be over it by the time we reach Velen.
<|endoftext|>
Cirilla|The peasant folk of Velen call this night the Feast of Gifts. I've no idea why.
Cirilla|I'll wait for you here.
Cirilla|Shit. Let's go, we must find the key.
Cirilla|Tally-ho!
Cirilla|Water coursing down there… Dammit, I'm jumping.
Cirilla|I was beginning to worry. Come, let's get the key.
Cirilla|Avallac'h claims vanity is Imlerith's greatest weakness.
Cirilla|Any foe he faces, he strives to impress.
Cirilla|The other one, Caranthir, is said to be secretive and pragmatic.
Cirilla|Hardly surprising given he was Avallac'h's student.
<|endoftext|>
Cirilla|The men at Crow's Perch, they spoke of this place.
Cirilla|Aard Cerbin. Home of the Ladies of the Wood.
Cirilla|The peasants feared coming here. And the baron thought the Ladies of the Wood a terrifying tale for naughty children. Incidentally, I wonder how the baron is.
Geralt|Ventured into the swamp to look for his wife. No idea if he ever found her.
Cirilla|A true shame.
Geralt|Let's get this done.
Cirilla|We must reach the peak, we'll find Imlerith there.
Geralt|We stand to find Imlerith here? You sure?
Cirilla|Avallac'h told me of beings who commune with the Aen Elle elves. They can be found in every part of our world. In Velen, the Crones do this.
Cirilla|Apparently, Imlerith came here at Eredin's behest, to order the Crones to keep their eyes open and ears pricked. In case Avallac'h were to seek shelter in his Velen hideout.
Geralt|Took the order literally judging by all the ears hanging in the woods. Think Imlerith might still be here?
Cirilla|He craves the pleasures of the flesh - wine, sex… The Crones indulge him, flatter his ego. I'm certain he'd not let this opportunity pass, and will be on Bald Mountain for the Sabbath.
Geralt|You actually know this area?
Cirilla|Centuries ago it was a hallowed site for druids. But then the Crones arrived - destroyed the Velen Circle and deformed the sacred oak atop the mountain.
Cirilla|An important feast is observed here annually. The Sabbath, they call it - all the local folk attend. I suspect Imlerith attends, too - as the Crones' guest.
Geralt|Seem to know it well.
Cirilla|Avallac'h's a good tutor.
Geralt|He found his wife, took her away, somewhere far. Anna… she was unwell.
Geralt|Hanged himself after his wife died. Daughter's in Novigrad.
<|endoftext|>
Verden Old Man 02|You're back? Join us, we can await the Ladies' messengers together.
Geralt|We should be going.
Verden Old Man 02|Eager to see the Ladies. I share your yearnin'.
Cirilla|We're afire with yearning. Come, Geralt, we must get there before daybreak.
Verden Old Man 02|Go to the tent and stand before Thecla. She's the one who decides who's worthy to face the Ladies.
Geralt|This celebration - what's it about?
Verden Peasant 05|Why d'ye need to know, wanderer?
Verden Old Man 02|No need for anger. The White One served the Ladies, as we do now.
Verden Old Man 02|We send 'em gifts all year long, and on this night they repay us with their blessing.
Cirilla|I met one of your gifts to the Crones - sniveling, scared to death, and about eight years old.
Geralt|Stay calm.
Geralt|Your children - why do the Ladies need them?
Verden Old Man 02|We know not and never ask.
Cirilla|You don't know? Then let me tell you.
Verden Old Man 02|Tell us instead what a peasant, his own young 'uns starvin', is to do with a wanderin' war orphan?
Verden Old Man 02|You're not from here. Don't judge us by others' laws.
Geralt|Said the Ladies bestow blessings on you…
Verden Old Man 02|Aye, for our lives turn thus - first a summer of laborin' 'neath the hot sun, then autumn rains, then a winter of death.
Verden Old Man 02|Then we await spring, when all that is dead is born anew. And from our blood and sweat the oak bears acorns - atimes few, atimes a handful.
Geralt|What do you do with the acorns?
Verden Old Man 02|The Velen elders gather, hold council. Some favor grinding 'em to spread on the fields for a rich harvest. Others want 'em given to a cunning woman, who'd make medicine for consumption.
Cirilla|A handful of enchanted acorns is enough for all Velen?
Verden Old Man 02|Tis never enough.
Geralt|Heard enough about this. We've got other questions.
Geralt|Mentioned a gate. Said we wouldn't pass.
Verden Old Man 02|Only the Chosen visit the Ladies. Every year young lads and lasses climb the mount, but never more than three.
Cirilla|Let me guess - the young lads and lasses don't return.
Verden Old Man 02|No, they return, happy and radiant. But rare is the one who then stays in Velen. Off they go to seek fortune in the wider world.
Geralt|Ladies of the Wood visit you?
Verden Old Man 02|If they favor us. My father told me they descended once, passed from fire to fire, listenin' to hopes and grievances. So each year we wait for them to walk amongst us once more.
Geralt|Haven't done it in a long time, then.
Cirilla|No point waiting to see if we'll get lucky.
Geralt|Yeah, we gotta try to reach the peak.
Verden Old Man 02|Let them approach.
Verden Peasant 05|But…
Verden Old Man 02|They've come for the feast. Wouldn't do to cast them out.
Geralt|Didn't come to celebrate. We need to get to the top of the mountain.
Verden Old Man 02|The gate is shut - you'll not pass. But we've fires down thataway, with food and drink aplenty. Sit down beside one and perhaps this year the Ladies will descend, give us the privilege of seein' 'em.
Geralt|We thank you for the invitation. Be glad to sit down, right?
Cirilla|Speak for yourself.
Verden Old Man 02|Come with me.
Geralt|We won't join you at your fires, though we thank you for the invitation. Time we were on our way.
Verden Old Man 02|You wish to see the Ladies. I, too, hope to, afore I die.
Verden Old Man 02|Go up the mountain and face old Thecla. She'll decide if you're worthy.
Geralt|Do just that. Farewell.

Verden Old Woman 03|Hm… Who's that?
Verden Old Woman 03|Well, c'mon, come closer, girl!
Verden Old Woman 03|Aye. What's she like?
Verden Woman 04|Narrow hips, sparkly eyes - a strikin', feisty lass.
Verden Old Woman 03|Never had a man? Mff. Never mind, got me answer.
Verden Old Woman 03|I choose you, girl. This night you shall see the Ladies.
Geralt|If she goes up the mountain, I go with her.
Verden Old Woman 03|Hmhm. What else has the cat dragged in?
Verden Woman 04|It's gray and veiny. Got a scar. And eyes like a viper.
Verden Old Woman 03|Aye, mff… Stinks of clotted blood and corpses. Plus it's old and infertile.
Verden Old Woman 03|I reject ye, freak - the girl will ascend alone.
Geralt|I'm going with her.
Verden Old Woman 03|Heheheh, he's fire in his gut. What do ye see?
Verden Woman 04|He's determined. He loves the girl, but he seeks to hide it from us.
Verden Old Woman 03|Perhaps I was mistaken. Perhaps there's life in 'im yet?
Verden Old Woman 03|By ancient rite, you may appeal my choice. But to do so you must best the challenge.
Geralt|I accept the challenge.
Verden Old Woman 03|Heheheh. Come.
Verden Old Woman 03|Look this over - a coin from days of yore. Falka burns on its reverse, so they call it the Defier's Oren.
Verden Old Woman 03|Now bring me the coin.
Geralt|What kind of challenge?
Verden Old Woman 03|Tell 'im.
Verden Woman 04|You must descend into the cave and bathe in the waters below the earth.
Cirilla|What's the catch?
Verden Old Woman 03|The waters're deep, the waters're murky.
Geralt|You misjudged me. I'm worthy as anyone.
Verden Old Woman 03|Mmm… Girl?
Cirilla|He's sprier than any youth. Only smells like corpses because he kills monsters.
Cirilla|And he'll kill any who stand in his way.
Geralt|What's this about? What've you chosen her for?
Verden Old Woman 03|Tell 'im.
Verden Woman 04|Each year three Chosen have the honor to meet the Ladies.
Geralt|What happens after they've had this honor?
Verden Woman 04|When they return, they speak o' the past no more. Joy rules them and they start life anew.
Verden Woman 04|The lass were not the first to be chosen this day. But the moon hangs high, so she's like to be the last.
Geralt|Ciri?
Cirilla|Wonderful. Who wouldn't want to meet the Ladies?
Cirilla|My companion comes with me.
Verden Woman 04|They're back.
Verden Old Woman 03|Whaddaya want?
Geralt|Can't help but be curious - what's at the summit?
Verden Old Woman 03|Tell 'im.
Verden Woman 04|The Ladies dwell there. But only the Chosen may look upon them.
Geralt|I know that, I want--
Verden Woman 04|You'll learn nothin' else here.
Geralt|Farewell.
Verden Old Woman 03|Go on, then - jump. Ye wish to see the Ladies, don't ye?
<|endoftext|>
Godling Johnny|Well I'll be, you're back!
Godling Johnny|And I see you've found your lass!
Godling Johnny|I'm Johnny - we've had the pleasure already, a bit one-sided though it was. See, I saw you runnin', your back to me, as I was, heh, havin' the pleasure of… 'Tis a long story.
Cirilla|They call me Ciri. Nice to meet you.
Geralt|How're things, Johnny?
Godling Johnny|Health's good, so no complaints. What brings you here?
Geralt|We gotta climb the mountain. Can you help?
Godling Johnny|I'd rather try to dissuade you, but I'm certain that would be in vain. The lass - she as stubborn as you?
Cirilla|Even more so.
Godling Johnny|Figured as much. Sigh. Path to the peak starts there, past the gate. But only old Thecla's got the key, so since you shan't ever get it, you'd best turn back now.
Geralt|Gotta get to the summit. Simple as that.
Godling Johnny|It's Thecla you'll need to convince. She's blind as your bum, but she won't be fooled.
Cirilla|We shan't try to trick her.
Godling Johnny|She sits in that tent over yonder. I wish you luck and do hope we meet again… someday.
Geralt|The key - why do you doubt we can get it?
Godling Johnny|Good grief, you're worse than children!
Godling Johnny|Three souls are allowed atop the mountain - and only strapping young lads or comely lasses among them. They get the key, open the gate and meet the Ladies.
Cirilla|I believe I qualify.
Godling Johnny|But he's old and ugly. What good is he?
Geralt|Pretty damned good at finding lost voices.
Godling Johnny|Then go find the voice of reason. It'll tell you to turn back. There's no foolin' with the Ladies.
Geralt|We're here to find an elf named Imlerith. Ciri thinks he might be a guest of the Crones.
Godling Johnny|Big bloke, in full plate? Goin' the right way - he's atop the mountain all right.
Cirilla|You've seen him?
Godling Johnny|Saw him in the bog first. Water froze beneath his horse's hooves. Then I saw him again yesterday, heading up this path.
Godling Johnny|Why're you looking for him?
Cirilla|He killed my friend.
Godling Johnny|Wouldn't seek revenge, if I were you. Even the Ladies bow and scrape before that one.
Geralt|What're you doing here? Last we met, you and the Crones weren't exactly friends.
Godling Johnny|I got an invitation I couldn't refuse - same as every year. In their peculiar way, the Crones tolerate my presence and wish to see me at their Sabbath…
Godling Johnny|So I come, wander about, and go home with the rising sun. What about you?
<|endoftext|>
Godling Johnny|He the one who kicked you out of your house?
Godling Sara|Yes.
Godling Johnny|Well, I must have a word with 'im.
Godling Sara|Don't hurt 'im!
Godling Johnny|Who do you think you are? Kickin' Sarah outta her home - how could you?
Geralt|Wasn't her home, and besides--
Godling Sara|Please, it worked out in the end. If I'd not left Novigrad, I'd never 'ave met Johnny.
Godling Johnny|Fine, I'll let you off this time.
Godling Johnny|See you found your lass. So what brings you here?
Geralt|We're heading up the mountain. Any advice?
Godling Sara|Yeah - don't do it. Johnny says the Crones aren't to be fooled with.
Godling Johnny|You've barely found your lass. Didn't find her just to lose her now, did you?
Cirilla|We'll be fine.
Godling Johnny|Do as you will. Path up the mountain starts t'other side of the gate, so you'll need the key. Old Thecla only gives it to those she deems worthy of the Ladies' presence.
Geralt|Thanks for the advice. We should go.
Godling Sara|Good luck.
Godling Johnny|Visit us sometime. We've a place not far from here.
Cirilla|We'll be certain to stop by. So long.
Geralt|Gate's locked? Why?
Godling Johnny|Good grief, worse than children, these two.
Godling Johnny|Durin' each Sabbath the Crones demand to meet three beautiful youngsters. Old Thecla picks 'em and gives 'em the key to the gate.
Godling Sara|She's young and beautiful.
Godling Johnny|But he's sure not.
Geralt|Let us worry about Thecla.
Godling Johnny|Don't lie to her, she'll sniff it out at once. If she refuses to help, you must tell her you wish to undergo the trial.
Cirilla|The trial?
Godling Johnny|Uh, Thecla will explain.
Geralt|We're looking for an elf named Imlerith. Ciri thinks the Crones might've invited him.
Godling Sara|The big knight? He near trampled me!
Cirilla|On his way up the mountain?
Godling Johnny|Yeah. What's it you want from him?
Cirilla|He killed my friend.
Godling Johnny|Out for vengeance, eh? Let it go. Dyin' foolishly won't help. Even the Crones bow and scrape before that one.
Geralt|What're you doing here? And how'd you two end up together?
Godling Johnny|Got an invitation we couldn't refuse. Around the Sabbath the Ladies get nicer of a sudden. Or maybe they're just out to show me who's in charge?
Cirilla|Did I hear right? You walked here all the way from Novigrad?
Godling Sara|Weren't no trouble for someone who talks to birds. A blackbird told me about Johnny, so I puttered over.
<|endoftext|>
Fugas|Hm…
Fugas|What's your name, girl?
Cirilla|What's yours?
Fugas|Hmm… Your name don't matter. Atop the peak you'll lose it and get another. You may go.
Fugas|And you?
Geralt|I passed the trial. Here's proof.
Geralt|Recognize it?
Fugas|The Defier's Oren.
Fugas|A death sentence.
Geralt|Got something to do up there. So just let us through.
Fugas|Hahaha!
Fugas|Heh, givin' me orders? You? A human?
<|endoftext|>
Fugas|One… Bun…
Fugas|Two… Poo…
Fugas|Three… Glee…
Fugas|Four… Whore…

Fugas|Eight… Fate…
Fugas|Nine… Swine…
Fugas|Ten… Wren…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|One tough son of a bitch.
Cirilla|We've no time to lose. I'll tend to Imlerith, you take the Crones. Avallac'h said they dwell below the oak, among its roots.
Geralt|No chance. I'm going after Imlerith.
Cirilla|Fine, let's play for it - rock, paper, scissors.
Cirilla|Dammit! Two out of three.
Geralt|Out of the question. I'll climb the mountain, you face the Crones.
Cirilla|Hardly a challenge.
Geralt|They're extremely dangerous. Be careful.
Cirilla|You too.
Geralt|Imlerith's a bigger threat than the Crones. I should face him.
Cirilla|I'm no worse a fighter than you.
Geralt|We both know that's not true. Listen to me this once.
Cirilla|But--
Geralt|No buts.
Cirilla|Fine. Be careful.
Geralt|You too.
<|endoftext|>
Witch Brewess|Aaooh…
Witch Weavess|More meat.
Witch Brewess|I feel two hundred years younger.
Witch Weavess|Aaaaah…
Witch Brewess|I feel two hundred years younger.
Witch Whispess|Bring the meat.
Witch Brewess|You killed her! You killed our sister!
Witch Weavess|She killed our sister!
Witch Whispess|You'll regret that!
<|endoftext|>
Imlerith|The sisters said you would come. They saw you arrive in the water's surface.
Imlerith|They did not see the girl, but she is with you, is she not?
Geralt|I'm here alone.
Imlerith|A lie which will change nothing.
Imlerith|First you, then her.
Geralt|Yeah. We're both here.
Imlerith|Where is the girl?
Geralt|Doesn't matter. You'll never get her.
Imlerith|You fought bravely in the ruined keep, to the bitter end.
Imlerith|I trust this time will be no different.
<|endoftext|>
Cirilla|We did it.
Geralt|Barely. How'd it go down there?
Cirilla|I slew only two of the Crones.
Cirilla|The third fled… with Vesemir's medallion. My sole memento.
Geralt|Coming here? Good idea.
Cirilla|I knew we'd succeed. From the start.
Cirilla|Now to find Eredin and kill him.
Cirilla|An oren for your thoughts.
Geralt|Wondering what to tell Yennefer when we get to Novigrad.
Cirilla|Tell her the truth. Always.
Cirilla|I wonder if Triss and Yennefer have found the sorceresses of the Lodge.
Cirilla|We ought to rejoin them.
Geralt|Yeah, let's get going.
Cirilla|Thank you - for coming with me.
Geralt|C'mere.
Cirilla|Heh, let's go.
Geralt|Gimme a minute. I'm old, need more rest.
Cirilla|Hm. You are and you do.
Cirilla|Let's stay a bit longer.
Geralt|You avenged Vesemir.
Cirilla|Avallac'h claims vengeance is only ever satisfying when served cold. He's wrong.
Geralt|We got lucky this time. Hope it stays with us.
Cirilla|It's not luck. You're a professional killer, and I'm a chip off the old block.
Cirilla|So, off to Novigrad, then?
Geralt|Yeah, let's get going.
Cirilla|Let's go.
Geralt|Gimme a minute. I'm old, need more rest.
Cirilla|Let's stay a bit longer.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Your acorns? No idea. Path to the summit's clear - you can always go looking for them.
Cirilla|Or just go home.
Geralt|This is no longer no man's land, it's no longer the Ladies' land. It's all yours.
Verden Old Man 02|But… what're we to do?
Cirilla|Come, Geralt. It's time.
Geralt|Manage… on your own.
Geralt|Don't know, don't care.
Cirilla|You must learn to live without them.
Geralt|I've got one. Take it.
Verden Peasant 05|But one? What'll we do now?
Geralt|There won't be any more acorns. Need to get by without them.
Verden Peasant 05|What now?
Verden Old Man 02|The oak is dead!
Cirilla|The oak, the Crones. I fear that was your last feast.
Verden Peasant 05|What of our acorns?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Who's captain of this ship?
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Lookin' at 'er.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Aye, her. That's right: I, a woman, am captain - shockin' as shit, I know.
Geralt|Need to get to Skellige.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Not on this boat, you won't.
Geralt|Pay you well.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|The islanders live off plunderin' the seas. Not willin' to risk that.
Geralt|Ever sailed there?
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Listen - the islanders attack all ships. When they hate someone - Nilfgaard, for instance - they attack 'em more, but truth be told not much more.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Boarded me once. Expect they wanted to see if I had captain's bollocks. That spot o' fun gave me enough Skellige for a lifetime.
Geralt|Farewell.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|No way in hell I'm sailin' to Skellige. Find another boat.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Don't give up easy, do you?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|How much would it cost me to hire this ship?
Novigrad Peasant 03|The "Harmony of Nations" ain't for hire. Ship's owners got plans for it.
Geralt|There anyone in Novigrad who'll take me to Skellige?
Novigrad Peasant 03|Tsk, you mean anyone here off their gourd? Aye, Wolverstone. Goes by the name of Flask. Ask at the Golden Sturgeon.
Novigrad Peasant 03|Man's a sheep bugger, like the Skelligers. Sure they get along great.
Geralt|I'm Skellige bound. Need to get there.
Novigrad Peasant 03|Start swimmin'. Islanders, the Black Ones - all attack us in those waters. No one sails the route these days.
Geralt|Come on. Clans are ready to deal, leave you alone if you do. Someone's done it, gotta have.
Novigrad Peasant 03|Not likely. 'Cept maybe that daft bastard Wolverstone from the "Atropos." A liar, a thief and a bugger, that one. He mighta parleyed with the sea-swine.
Geralt|Hm. Where can I find him?
Novigrad Peasant 03|In a pigsty, most times. Others - the Golden Sturgeon. Ask for Flask - everyone knows 'im.
Geralt|You captain of this tub?
Novigrad Peasant 03|What's it to you?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|You Wolverstone, captain of the Atropos?
Novigrad Old Man 02|So you want to know… if I'm Atropos, cap'n of the Wolverstone…? No fuckin' clue, mate…
Geralt|I need to get to Skellige.
Novigrad Old Man 02|My Atropos and me, we're due to sail for Ard Skellig.
Novigrad Old Man 02|Carryin' grain. But that's hush-hush.
Novigrad Old Man 02|Got any coin?
Geralt|Here. That enough?
Novigrad Old Man 02|Hefty sack, like a bull's. When do we sail?
Geralt|Not sure you're ready. You can barely stand.
Novigrad Old Man 02|Know this, stranger. Captain Wolverstone never sails sober. The sea goes one way, Wolverstone the other. Makes the rockin' bearable.
Novigrad Old Man 02|So, ready to set sail?
Geralt|Let's go.
Novigrad Old Man 02|Ah-ah-ah. First we must drink to the wind, to good fortune, and to the strength of my Atropos.
Novigrad Old Man 02|Ah. Anchors aweigh!
Geralt|Gimme some time to prepare.
Novigrad Old Man 02|Prepare all you want. She's not done loadin' as it is.
Geralt|Gotta get more coin.
Novigrad Old Man 02|You sure do. For I won't even wet me arse in a bath without payment in advance.
Novigrad Old Man 02|You're back! Got the coin?
Novigrad Old Man 02|Ship's ready. We sailin' or not?
Geralt|May I?
Novigrad Old Man 02|Depends what with.
Geralt|Looking for someone who'll sail to Skellige. And take me with them.
Geralt|Eredin… King of the Wild Hunt. And Ciri…

Steingrim|Know the way to Kaer Trolde?
Geralt|Expect I'll find it.
Steingrim|Head north, then turn west towards the bay before you come to the bridge. You'll find the jarl portside today. Your sorceress oughta be there, too.
Geralt|Thanks. So long.
Steingrim|See you're settlin' in like a ship run aground.
Geralt|Wanted to look around. I like to know where I've landed.
Geralt|Back off, or I'll kill you.
Steingrim|I'm not afeard of dyin'.
Geralt|Rob every corpse that washes up on shore?
Steingrim|Takin' from a corpse ain't theft. I'm a man o' the Isles. I don't reap, I don't sow - the waves bring me my harvest.
Steingrim|On the Atropos, were you?
Geralt|Yeah. Thought the captain had a deal with you.
Steingrim|With us? Meanin' who, exactly? Might've arranged somethin' with Lugos, but Crach? Nay. Clearly should've, though. Outlander ships aren't welcome in these waters. What about you? What do you seek in Skellige, eh?
Geralt|Agreed to meet a sorceress here - Yennefer of Vengerberg. She's supposed to be on Ard Skellig.
Steingrim|There's a witch at Kaer Trolde - Crach's guest. Could be the one you're meetin'.
Geralt|Seen her? Know what the sorceress looks like?
Steingrim|Aye. Wears black and white. If not for her tits you'd think she was a beached orca.
Steingrim|Fact is, even those who see her for a wench'd gladly push her out to sea, tits and all.
Geralt|Yennefer's not all bad. Once you get to know her.
Steingrim|Heheh, take your word for it.
Geralt|What's your name?
Steingrim|Steingrim.
Geralt|Well, Steingrim, I don't like you. In fact, I feel like slapping you.
Steingrim|Go ahead, drifter. You try.
Geralt|That scorn I hear in your voice?
Steingrim|You've good ears. Folk say this witch's got Crach wrapped around her finger.
Steingrim|Orders everyone about. Word is she's vicious at it, but a hag's a hag.
Geralt|See I've landed on Ard Skellig…
Steingrim|How you figure that?
Geralt|You're wearing Clan an Craite colors. Ard Skellig's their island.
Geralt|Had enough?
Steingrim|Best finish me now, 'cause you'll be fucked once I catch my breath.
Geralt|It was a good fight. That's enough for now.
Steingrim|So? Had enough?
Geralt|You fight well, Steingrim.
Steingrim|One day I'll show you how I drink.
Steingrim|That how you want it? More blood? Fine. We'll make it a fight to the death…
Steingrim|Trofast! Get 'im, boy!
Novigrad Poor Man 02|Storm approaching!
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Reef in the sails!
Novigrad Poor Man 02|Bring her about! Head to wind!
Novigrad Poor Man 02|Storm approaching!
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Reef in the sails!
Novigrad Poor Man 02|Bring her about! Head to wind!

Skellige Girl 03|Why can't I play today, da?
Skellige Fisherman 06|We've got to go to the port, bid farewell to King Bran. It's not fittin' to play, Agnet.
Skellige Girl 03|Who'll be king of Skellige now?
Skellige Fisherman 06|None know that. But the gods'll make sure it'll be one worthy, one before who it'll be no shame to bow our heads.
Skellige Bard 01|A king's passing - there's an occasion worthy of a new song!
Skellige Woman 05|A year now you've promised to write somethin' for me.
Skellige Bard 01|Any old hack can write a song for a lass. Not so when you've to commemorate the death of a king!
Skellige Woman 05|Didn't write one lousy word for me while the king were alive.
Skellige Bard 01|This here's my chance, don't you see?! This one ballad could make me Clan Tuirseach's court skald.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Villager 02|Come on, trim it. It's got to be ready in time for the funeral, or Crach'll send us away with Bran.
Skellige Villager 01|I'm tryin'! I do wonder where they'll put it up.
Skellige Villager 02|On the shore at Larvik. His fierce gaze to protect us from the Black Ones!
Skellige Villager 01|We've hewn the post.
Skellige Villager 02|Time for the chiselers.
Skellige Villager 01|Bust's gotta be worthy of a konung.
Skellige Warrior 01|Sacrificed me best mare… 'Twas an honor.
Skellige Villager 04|She were good and true here, she'll be so beyond…
Skellige Warrior 01|May she serve our king worthily. One day we'll meet again.
Skellige Villager 04|As we'll all meet King Bran. And feast at his table. And sing his praise.
Skellige Warrior 01|Bran, our king! Take this mount we offer in sacrifice!
Skellige Villager 04|May she serve you well, there beyond, where you've gone!
Skellige Warrior 01|Ride, ride, your deeds be many and glorious!
Skellige Warrior 03|Bran of Clan Tuirseach! Our valiant king! Great is our loss!
Skellige Warrior 02|All must see the change your demise has wrought!
Skellige Warrior 03|We offer you our manes - the symbol of our valor, as you were the valor of the Isles.
Skellige Warrior 04|Our skulls shall be bare till a new king sits upon Skellige's throne.
Skellige Warrior 03|Let's drink to Bran of Clan Tuirseach!
Skellige Warrior 04|Let's drink to Clan an Craite, that's taken on the burden of this farewell!
Skellige Villager 06|So what've you brought for the farewell feast?
Skellige Warrior 05|Bread… Sheep's milk cheese…
Skellige Villager 06|Our wagon's full of loot we ripped from the Black Ones.
Skellige Warrior 05|We've also wine from temples of Melitele, remote ones.
Skellige Warrior 05|Wonder what'll please Bran more - your victuals or our war booty…
Skellige Guard 01|Let us pay homage to Bran of Clan Tuirseach. May our horns echo 'midst the cliffs and peaks!
Skellige Guard 01|On my mark…!
Skellige Guard 01|Blooooooow!

Geralt|So why won't Ermion let you inspect the area of the anomaly?
Yennefer|Call it a difference of opinion. A large, loud difference.
Yennefer|Look, it's Crach.
Crach|White Wolf!
Geralt|Greetings, Crach.
Crach|I shall see you at the wake. And I'll not accept any excuses - I've an important matter to discuss with you.
Yennefer|I shall wear black and white for the feast. I count on you to don something complimentary. Something that doesn't reek of a thousand hunts.
Geralt|Yen, you know I can't stand new doublets. Just too tight till you break them in…
Yennefer|And just like Crach, I'll not accept any excuses. We're not here to enjoy ourselves - we've matters to resolve and should dress appropriately.
Yennefer|I've rented a room at the inn. Took the liberty of laying out some clothes for you there. You ought to go, choose something. In the meantime, I've something to attend to. We'll meet at the entrance to the feast hall.
Yennefer|Guess our solitary hut will have to wait. Crach an Craite's someone we want on our side.
Geralt|Ermion's head of the Skellige circle? Haven't seen him since… hmm…
Yennefer|Since Ciri was a little girl.
Yennefer|I doubt he'll do you any favors. Not even for old times' sake.
Ermion|You need not do this, child.
Skellige Woman 01|I know. But I want to.
Skellige Old Woman 01|Tis madness, such a young lass…
Skellige Old Man 01|Birna should be the one goin', they shared a bed longer.
Ermion|Silence. 'Tis her decision.
Geralt|How about you? What've you learned?
Yennefer|Something strange happened on Ard Skellig a time ago. A disaster brought about by a burst of magic. Extraordinary, really, a natural anomaly. Never seen anything like it.
Yennefer|My intuition tells me Ciri was its cause.
Geralt|As much as I respect your intuition, Yen, we need something specific, evidence.
Yennefer|I'd know for certain if I was able to inspect the disaster zone. Unfortunately, Ermion and his druids aren't letting anyone near.
Geralt|Didn't learn much in Velen. Ciri wound up at the home of a local baron. She also quarreled with some witches.
Geralt|That's about all I've learned.
Yennefer|Good. You'll need to tell me more when we have some time.
Geralt|I'm not done searching in Velen yet.
Yennefer|Thought you'd tend to that immediately.
Geralt|Change of plans.
Geralt|Velen - awful place. Somehow Ciri wound up at the castle of the local ruler - a baron, self-proclaimed. This was after she was injured.
Yennefer|Injured? Was it serious?
Geralt|Don't think so. Must've recovered, because this baron sent her on to Novigrad. Think she was looking for you at the time.
Geralt|Haven't looked around Novigrad yet.
Geralt|Ciri found Dandelion in Novigrad. They met up.
Geralt|That's everything.
Yennefer|So Dandelion knows what happened to Ciri?
Geralt|Yeah. Gotta find him.
Geralt|They robbed one crime boss and almost killed another…
Geralt|Ciri was looking for something. She needed coin and information.
Geralt|That's all I know at this point. Gotta find Dandelion, talk to him.
Geralt|Dandelion got them in trouble. Ciri made an enemy of Whoreson Junior, one of the city's crime bosses.
Geralt|Been to Novigrad. Ciri was there, looking for a way to lift some curse. She's not there anymore.
Yennefer|You're certain?
Geralt|Heard it from Dandelion - with no embellishments.
Yennefer|Do you know any more about this curse?
Geralt|Not much. Ciri ran into some trouble, never finished what she went there to do. I recovered a phylactery - she was looking for a way to enchant it.
Yennefer|I'll look at it later.
Geralt|Actually, I don't have anything solid - about Velen or Novigrad.
Yennefer|I was hoping you'd have learned something by the time you arrived. But, since you haven't, we'll start our search in Skellige.
Geralt|Also ran into an old friend of ours in Velen - Keira.
Yennefer|What on earth is Keira Metz doing in that wasteland?
Geralt|Hiding from witch hunters. Listen, she told me an elven mage had been there, looking for Ciri.
Geralt|These witches Ciri came across - she was lucky to escape them.
Yennefer|Witches?
Geralt|Creatures, more like. Can't say exactly what they are. But they're dangerous. Very.
Yennefer|Did you learn anything in Velen?
Geralt|You look beautiful.
Yennefer|Thank you. Nice to see you again.
Yennefer|The eulogy.
Ermion|King Bran of Clan Tuirseach has embarked on his final voyage. At its end, our glorious ancestors await him. Together they will hunt and raid.
Ermion|They will sit 'round the fire and praise the deeds of ages past.
Ermion|For now, he lives in our hearts. One day, we too shall stand at his side and face the sea together.
Ermion|That will be a good day.
Geralt|You knew Bran?
Yennefer|Yes. He was well respected.
Yennefer|Unlike his wife.
Crach|Skellige is its clans. In times of war, tradition holds the clans unite under the leadership of their king.
Crach|We've bid Bran farewell. Time to pick his successor, who will lead us against the Black Ones.
Crach|The gates of Kaer Trolde stand open to all who held Bran of Clan Tuirseach dear. Mead and meat will be plentiful.
Crach|During the wake, those who believe themselves worthy of the crown will step forth.
Geralt|Come to the wake with me?
Yennefer|Gladly.
Yennefer|Feasts in Skellige - so predictable. Slobbering drunks, brazen boasting, and the inevitable rows that result…
Geralt|Yeah, nothing like the banquets mages attend. Remember the one on Thanned?
Yennefer|You were there - how could I forget? I also remember excruciatingly well what happened after the banquet.
Geralt|Reading my mind again?
Yennefer|Mhm. What's more, I like what I see.
Geralt|Stop reading my mind.
Yennefer|Something to hide?
Geralt|Don't like secrets?
Yennefer|No.
Geralt|Hope we don't have to go to this wake.
Yennefer|Well… We don't have to go…
Geralt|Haven't seen each other in two years. I want a solitary cottage by the sea. I wanna lock myself inside with you, stay there for a week.
Yennefer|What would we do there for a week?
Geralt|Got so many ideas…
Yennefer|The one with the rope you use for trophies, that one seems interesting.
Geralt|You smell wonderful.
Yennefer|Geralt - we're at a funeral.
Geralt|You smell wonderful at this funeral.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|This's gotta be Yen's room. She always did like space.
Geralt|And luxury…
Geralt|Glamour… Scent of lilac and gooseberries, even with the lid on…
Geralt|Taste hasn't changed.
Geralt|Hm… The stuffed unicorn. She fixed it.
Geralt|Tissaia de Vries, "The Poisoned Source" - still turns to it for inspiration.
Geralt|No idea how she managed to bring so much clothing. Must've hired out a galleon.
Geralt|As usual - black and white.
Geralt|Her megascope…? Guess she never goes anywhere without it.
Geralt|As Philippa Eilhart said, megascopes and toothbrushes - deeply personal possessions…
Geralt|Riiight… Just not something I'd ever wear. Buuut, what don't we do for our--
Geralt|Hm… Who exactly is she to me?
<|endoftext|>
Yennefer|Why am I not surprised? Oh, Geralt, Geralt - what is that you're wearing?
Geralt|Didn't want to detract from your beauty.
Yennefer|A man at a woman's side is an accessory - he should enhance her beauty. But I thank you for the compliment.
Geralt|We should mingle before they all get drunk. There'll be no talking to anyone then.
Yennefer|Good thinking. I don't know what Crach wants, but when we meet with him we should have clear minds.
Geralt|I'm not gonna drink. Why dull my senses when I'm in such pleasant company?
Yennefer|Do you plan to compliment me all evening?
Geralt|I plan to tell you what I think.
Geralt|Ugh, don't like funerals, don't like feasts.
Yennefer|I know. You also dislike underdone meat and being teleported. But sometimes we must overcome our disgusts and prevail.
Yennefer|Lovely outfit. You look… dashing.
Geralt|Thank you. You're… dazzling.
Yennefer|You know I really missed your candidness. I'm glad we're here, together.
Yennefer|I can see you chose your own outfit. You know, of course, that together we look about as good as lace frills on a battle axe.
Geralt|Everyone's got their style.
Lady Bran|Lady Yennefer. So pleased you've come to pay your respects to my dead husband.
Yennefer|I knew Konung Bran well. His passing is the Isles' great loss.
Lady Bran|It is… We must do all we can to minimize its tragic consequences.
Yennefer|Bran was a great ruler.
Lady Bran|He needs a worthy successor.
Yennefer|You speak as though you have someone in mind.
Lady Bran|Skellige's troubles very much derive from it not being a hereditary monarchy. Any upstart can be king and destroy his predecessor's legacy.
Yennefer|The King of the Isles is a more symbolic position.
Lady Bran|And that should change as well. A strong leader who wields true power - that is what the times require.
Geralt|Introduce me?
Yennefer|This is my friend Geralt, and this is Birna - widow of the dear departed Bran.
Lady Bran|The Queen Mother. It's a pleasure to meet you, Geralt. You must forgive me, but on a day like today, I'm afraid I cannot indulge in my penchant for long conversations.
Geralt|I'm Geralt. A witcher.
Lady Bran|Birna. Queen of Skellige. I'm glad we've met, but you must forgive me. Duty calls.
<|endoftext|>
Yennefer|Geralt, there's something I've been meaning to ask you.
Geralt|Hm?
Yennefer|Your beard. Why'd you decide to grow it out?
Geralt|Don't really know.
Yennefer|Hm.
Yennefer|Must say it suits you.
Yennefer|Hm… All those years… I actually wondered what you'd look like…
Geralt|And? Disappointed?
Yennefer|You've not changed at all.
Geralt|Expect me to? What, coulda dyed my hair black. The Black Wolf… How's that sound?
Yennefer|People change. Men go bald… or grow beards…
Geralt|Willing to let mine fill in… If you enjoy being scratched.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Woman 01|My Gotten died a hero's death. Faced three Black Ones alone. They cut his arm off at the shoulder.
Skellige Woman 02|Holte slit his own throat - wouldn't let hisself be took prisoner.
Yennefer|I couldn't help overhearing. Fate was unkind to your menfolk.
Skellige Woman 01|Widows' isles - that's what Skellige is.
Skellige Woman 02|To you continentals, war started a half year back. We've been fightin' Nilfgaard for years now.
Skellige Woman 01|And we're not like to ever stop.
Geralt|Your husbands died glorious deaths.
Skellige Woman 01|Oh aye. Gotten captained a longship, near three dozen men aboard. Raided half a dozen Nilfgaardian villages, filled his hull with captives…
Skellige Woman 01|On the return, they came across a Black fleet... Three galleons... But our men did not flee. Instead, they drew close and boarded... Gotten chopped off an imperial captain's head.
Skellige Woman 01|Then they backed 'im 'gainst the rails. He died with a war-cry on his lips.
Skellige Woman 02|My Holte was a scout. Snuck into the enemy's camp. Hounds sniffed 'im out. When the Black Ones surrounded 'im, he slit his own throat. Refused to let them question 'im.
Geralt|Crach's sure to see that you're cared for.
Yennefer|Women don't need men to care for them, Geralt.
Skellige Woman 01|The sorceress speaks true. We take care of ourselves. War and death are twin sisters - we've long known both.
Skellige Woman 02|No one mourns here. Tears we replace with vengeance. The women of Skellige are fertile, and we birth no cowards.
Geralt|Farewell. May your sons make port as many times as they sail out.
Skellige Woman 02|As the gods will it, so shall it be.
Yennefer|Must say I like the women of Skellige. It's as if each one would make a good sorceress.
Geralt|Can't think of a single sorceress from Skellige. Let alone a famous one.
Yennefer|Lytta Neyd. Known also as Coral. Don't you remember?
<|endoftext|>
Donar An Hindar|Tell me, Lugos, why're you sendin' your vermin to my isle?
Lugos The Mad|That squealin' swine sounds uncannily like Donar. Too bad I don't talk to swine.
Donar An Hindar|Not talkin' to you, shitbrains. I'm warnin' you.
Yennefer|Allow me to introduce Geralt of Rivia, a witcher. Geralt, Jarl Donar an Hindar and Jarl Madman Lugos.
Donar An Hindar|Callin' Lugos a madman's an insult to madmen. He's a common goatfucker.
Lugos The Mad|Call me goatfucker one more time, and I'll chop off your head, stick it on a pike, and piss down your neckhole.
Donar An Hindar|Enough. Time to settle this - here and now.
Lugos The Mad|Oh, hahahah! Givin' me a true fright right now! Shat me best trousers! Put that away before you cut yourself, you cunt.
Geralt|Thought Skelligers called a truce for feasts.
Donar An Hindar|I know the hallowed customs. But Lugos ought to know that I'll not let him raid my Hindarsfjall bare.
Lugos The Mad|You don't scare anyone, Donar. I'll be by soon to plough your priestesses, drink from your tankard and shit on your table. Be sure to leave a candle lit for me.
Yennefer|Emperor would be very pleased to hear you quarrel.
Lugos The Mad|His Imperial Majesty is more than welcome to visit.
Donar An Hindar|Let 'im sail over here. We ain't afeard o' the Black Ones.
Yennefer|Raiding coastal villages is one thing. Total war with the empire is another.
Lugos The Mad|Awfully mouthy, this one. Go stir your cauldron and pierce some boils, witch. Don't talk when you haven't got a fuckin' clue.
Geralt|Know what, Lugos? Just realized I don't give a damn about your hallowed rules of hospitality.
Lugos The Mad|Finally! Some diversion! And here I was ready to puke from all the boredom.
Lugos The Mad|Come on, freak. Show us what you're made of!
Donar An Hindar|Move the benches! There's to be some gob slappin'!
Geralt|Calm down, Lugos.
Lugos The Mad|No wench'll teach me how to fight.
Yennefer|That was not my intention.
Yennefer|Come, Geralt, I believe this discussion's run its course.
Geralt|Settle this outside.
Lugos The Mad|Who the fuck are you to advise me, eh?
Yennefer|Someone with better manners. You insult Bran's memory and Crach's hospitality with this.
Geralt|Had enough?
Lugos The Mad|Argh, aah, ye got me good. That were quite a wallop. Still seein' spots… Room' rockin' like a leaky tub in a hurricane.
Geralt|We'll call it even, then, soon as you apologize to the lady.
Lugos The Mad|Don't hold it against me, m'lady. It's my deep conviction sorceresses're needed, deeply so.
Yennefer|No offense taken. Forget about it.
Lugos The Mad|That I like. And the knockin' - it's what men do. Gimme your paw, witcher, lemme squeeze. It's a worthy one.
Lugos The Mad|Witcher, have a drink with me. Proof there's no hard feelings.
Lugos The Mad|And visit me atimes, I insist. Jorund's been jabberin' about bringin' in a witcher for that haunted lighthouse.
Lugos The Mad|Do me favor, meet 'im for an ale at the tavern near Arinbjorn. Then you've but a short jaunt to find me so's we can knock back somethin' stronger.
Lugos The Mad|Here's to our next!
Geralt|Sure, I'll knock one back with you, Lugos.
Geralt|Nothing wrong with having a drink in good company.
Yennefer|I remind you we've important matters to discuss later. Matters that require a clear mind.
Geralt|I remember.
Geralt|To Jarl Madman Lugos and his madness!
Geralt|Forgive us. We should mingle, talk to some of the other guests.
Yennefer|Geralt, I'd have nothing against you drinking yourself stupid if we had nothing important planned…
Geralt|Yennefer and I'd be honored. Here's to your health!
Geralt|No hard feelings, but we'll have to drink another time.
Yennefer|Yes. We've important discussions ahead.
Lugos The Mad|You land rats are all the same - afeard o' your wenches.
Lugos The Mad|What do ya say to that, eh? Fat lot o' help they did you, them… mutations or what's it you call 'em. We Skelligers got our own ways. We live, eat, breathe, drink and fuck in the bracin' air of these isles. Strength follows naturally.
Lugos The Mad|And wenches like strong lads, am I right?
Yennefer|What wenches don't like are boors. High time you learned that.
Lugos The Mad|Your loss.
Lugos The Mad|Drink like you fight, and we're in for a good time. To Bran!
<|endoftext|>
Holger Blackhand|Do you have no shame?
Lady Bran|Shame…? Why would I?
Holger Blackhand|A queen should join her king on his last journey. Tradition demands it.
Yennefer|Geralt, this is Holger Blackhand. Birna, Bran's widow and our hostess today, you've already met.
Holger Blackhand|Widow? A widow's duty is to lie beside her husband.
Lady Bran|A widow's duty is to care for the king's son.
Holger Blackhand|Not by our customs it ain't.
Yennefer|Your customs are barbarous.
Geralt|Not our place to criticize, Yen. All peoples do things their own way.
Yennefer|We're talking about the self-immolation of women, not about decorating trees for Yule.
Geralt|Harsh custom, but this is a harsh land. Tradition is Skellige's backbone.
Yennefer|People make laws, and people can change them.
Geralt|Let's move on, Yen.
Lady Bran|High time we did as well. Come, Svanrige.
Holger Blackhand|Birna's a scheming whore. Refuses to admit her reign's ended.
Holger Blackhand|Bran knew how to keep her in line. Let's drink to his memory.
Geralt|To Bran.
Yennefer|Come, Geralt.
Holger Blackhand|Stay and chew the fat with us, Geralt.
Holger Blackhand|Now I've a toast. May the emperor of Nilfgaard's prick stay as soft as a noodle, so there'll be no foul spawn to take his place on the throne!
Geralt|We should go.
Yennefer|We were supposed to move on.
Holger Blackhand|Let your woman roam alone. You stay here, we'll have another drink.
Geralt|Bran - a great king, a great man.
Holger Blackhand|May our next king be his equal.
Yennefer|Geralt?
Geralt|All right. Let's go.
Geralt|Heard a lot of good things about Bran.
Lady Bran|I will miss him sorely.
Lady Bran|I was not his first wife, but I bore him his first-born son and saw him off on his final journey.
Lady Bran|We lived a great many years together.
Geralt|A custom that demands widows burn themselves alive - too harsh.
Holger Blackhand|Foreigners.
Lady Bran|Holger, perhaps you'd like to show us the meaning of courage, walk willingly into flames. I'm sure we can scrape together some wood.
Holger Blackhand|Callin' me a coward?!
Svanrige|Calm yourself, Holger. You speak to a widow at her husband's wake.
Geralt|Holger… To your health, especially that black hand!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Gladly. What're the rules?
Cerys|Whoever pulls Hjalmar's axe from the stump at the top of the hill, wins. Stray off the path, and you lose.
Lugos The Glaucous|And here I was ready to puke from all the boredom! Let's go!
Geralt|Honored to be asked, but maybe some other time.
Halbjorn|Shame.
Otrygg An Hindar|Enough of the natterin'. Let's drink!
Geralt|To Cerys!
Lugos The Glaucous|Pass the mead and a tankard for the man!
Otrygg An Hindar|To Bran! May he want for nothing in the world beyond!
Geralt|To my beautiful companion!
Yennefer|You've been great company. Sadly, it's time we moved on.
Geralt|Really…?
Yennefer|Indeed. We must talk. But not here.
Yennefer|You shall learn all beyond that door.
Geralt|Can't today, for good reason, believe me.
Halbjorn|If not today, then when?!
Halbjorn|Cerys is jealous, for the one among us who performs the greatest feat will be crowned king.
Cerys|We all know the feats are a sideshow. Our fathers will choose who will wear the crown. What d'you think they spoke to Crach about?
Halbjorn|You talk like that 'cause you're short of strength and skill. Remember when Hjalmar challenged us all to a race up the mount? You didn't stand with us then. As he buried his axe in that stump at the top to mark his victory, you were warmin' your chicken bones by the fire.
Cerys|Had my reasons for not participatin'. But I woulda won then, as I'd win now.
Geralt|Hm, now that you mentioned him… just noticed Hjalmar's not here.
Cerys|My brother walks his own paths.
Cerys|But about the race… why don't we repeat it? I'm willin' to challenge any of you, witcher included. If I beat him to the top, venture to say that'd be a feat, eh? So, you in?
Lugos The Glaucous|If the witcher's in.
Yennefer|Geralt?
Geralt|See the wake's in full swing.
Lugos The Glaucous|Lost sight o' youse. Who won?
Geralt|Cerys, proving she's her brother Hjalmar's equal in every way. She retrieved the axe from the cliff.
Halbjorn|Cannot be!
Lugos The Glaucous|Now I know why Hjalmar named you Sparrowhawk!
Cerys|I lost.
Otrygg An Hindar|Lost to a witcher, Sparrowhawk. That'd likely happen to any of us.
Lugos The Glaucous|Dunno why ye strayed from the agreed path, witcher. But if one were to ask me, I might say ye gave up.
Otrygg An Hindar|Be that as it may, still a good excuse for a drink. Crach's rolled out some prime mead!
Yennefer|They've seated us here.
Cerys|I asked them to. Wanted to meet the notorious witcher Geralt.
Geralt|We've met. Don't remember?
Cerys|That was ages ago. Hjalmar and I were children when you last visited our da. But you should meet your feast-mates. Allow me the dubious honor.
Cerys|That's Halbjorn, son of Holger Blackhand. Blueboy Lugos, Madman Lugos' firstborn. And chokin' down a stockfish over there's Otrygg an Hindar.
Geralt|Forgive me, I remember our meeting those years ago, but I don't recall your name.
Lugos The Glaucous|Cerys an Craite. Crach, her da, and her big brother Hjalmar call her Sparrowhawk. A jarl's daughter she is. Fat lot of good it does her.
Geralt|Seems they sat us with the sons of jarls, exclusively.
Yennefer|Cerys an Craite is the daughter of a jarl, Geralt. Jarls' daughters are in no way inferior to their sons.
Cerys|Do you know every last one of 'em dreams of bein' Bran's successor? Look at 'em - likely lot.
<|endoftext|>
Udalryk|What did you see in the beasts' innards?
Hjort|The gods are not kind, Jarl. Our isles are in for hard times.
Udalryk|What's that mean - "The isles are in for hard times"? Speak clear.
Hjort|The heart was deformed. An ill omen always.
Udalryk|An ill omen for me as well? Hear me? What'll become of me?
Hjort|Fear not, Jarl. I'll not let you perish, I assure you. You need only follow my council.
Yennefer|I present to you Geralt of Rivia. Geralt… This is Udalryk, jarl of the Brokvar clan, from Spikeroog, and his advisor, Hjort.
Hjort|The White Wolf.
Udalryk|Greetings.
Geralt|Nice to meet you both.
Udalryk|A toast, to honor King Bran's memory.
Geralt|To Bran.
Yennefer|Geralt, we should go now.
Udalryk|Hjort, the pain returns to my head. Once again, it starts.
Yennefer|We'll leave you alone.
Geralt|Strange man.
Yennefer|I hear he's very sick. Carrying himself unusually well tonight.
Yennefer|Geralt, I need you to be sober.
Udalryk|Hjort, it's back… the ache in my temples…
Geralt|A worthy gesture, Udalryk, but I need to keep my head clear today. Got an important conversation later.
Geralt|Gotta say, never really believed in omens and auguries.
Hjort|One's belief or lack thereof - makes no difference.
Udalryk|Tell him what awaits him. What you told me.
Hjort|Your fates will intertwine - yours and Udalryk's. You will walk in darkness. Before you - fire and shadow.
Yennefer|Hear that, Geralt? Everything clear now?
Geralt|Thanks for the prediction.
Hjort|You do not believe now, but you will yet remember my words.
Geralt|Didn't plan to visit Spikeroog.
Hjort|Man is not the master of his fate.
Geralt|If you don't mind, Yen, I'd like to ask about us. What's the future hold in store?
Hjort|The one you seek you will find, and then she will die.
Yennefer|So I won't meet a tall dark stranger? I shall have to content myself with you, Geralt.
Hjort|I sense the mockery in your voice, my lady. But my omens do not lie.
Udalryk|May your futures not be as black as they look!
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Priestess 01|…Now heed my words. There is no greater act of valor than to fight a beast cursed by men and gods.
Skellige Priestess 01|No greater deed than that done to serve the goddess.
Crach|Words of uncommon beauty. We thank you and will take them to heart… But now - let's begin!
Crach|We have seen Bran off into the beyond and must now choose his successor.
Crach|A king must be wise. A king must command respect. A king must have bollocks. We've no lack of men like that.
Crach|Let those who feel worthy of the throne of Skellige step forth.
Crach|My son could not be here this day. Behold his axe. Behold his will.
Crach|May the best man… or woman… win.
Crach|What's got into her?
Yennefer|She's your daughter, is she not?
Crach|Now I know why she said she'll sail to Spikeroog. Ah, children! The older they grow, the more trouble they are.
Crach|Come with me. All the more essential we talk now.
Arnvald|Crach an Craite asked about you.
Yennefer|We went out... for a breath of fresh air.
Arnvald|Ahem, the claimants to the throne will step forth in a moment.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What now?
Yennefer|Now we pay a visit to Ermion's laboratory.
Geralt|Didn't know we'd been invited.
Yennefer|Because we've not been.
Geralt|Take it Ermion won't be there?
Yennefer|That's right.
Geralt|And what's the purpose of this visit?
Yennefer|We're looking for an object - the Mask of Uroboros. We'll need it.
Geralt|We shouldn't be breaking into Ermion's workshop.
Yennefer|If I didn't know you better I'd say you needed to grow a pair. But I know that you simply enjoy complaining - it's the only reason you said that.
Geralt|Why would we go there?
Yennefer|To retrieve an item - the Mask of Uroboros. We'll need it and, therefore, must steal it.
Geralt|Right, 'course.
Geralt|Now you'll tell me why you need this mask.
Yennefer|Oh, I shall. In due course.
Geralt|Take you'll decide when.
Yennefer|Correct.
Yennefer|Come, Geralt.
<|endoftext|>
Yennefer|Shh…. Guards.
Yennefer|Hide behind the tapestry.
Skellige Guard 02|Sparrows chip, while starlings chirp.
Skellige Guard 03|What do jackdaws do?
Skellige Guard 02|Jackdaws caw.
Skellige Guard 02|Goldfinches warble and cranes whoop, whereas peacocks screech.
Skellige Guard 02|Hawks scream, larks trill, and doves, they coo. That's all of 'em.
Skellige Guard 03|Hmm… What about nightingales?
Skellige Guard 02|Ah, right. Nightingales croon.
<|endoftext|>
Yennefer|Ah, our dear druid's laboratory. We must search it thoroughly. The Mask of Uroboros must be here.
Geralt|Skelligers' tales about the Wild Hunt…
Yennefer|The islanders believe the wraiths sail on a longship built of the claws of dead men.
Geralt|Letter bearing Ermion's seal… To the druids. Warns them about you.
Geralt|"…that brazen manipulator?"
Yennefer|Hrmph. The shameless schemer.
Geralt|A goat carved out of linden wood. Signed: "To Uncle Ermion."
Yennefer|Little Ciri's handiwork. That's what she called him when he was her tutor.
Geralt|Laboratory worthy of an imperial alchemist.
Yennefer|Ermion's wand. He's one of the few druids to use one.
Yennefer|Let's go inside, Geralt.
Yennefer|I'll lock the entrance. We don't want to raise suspicions.
Yennefer|Footsteps!
Geralt|That was close.
Yennefer|Mhm.
Geralt|Seen uglier sights in my life.
Yennefer|Geralt of Rivia, being romantic.
Yennefer|Amazing how a hobby can render a man mysterious, fascinating.
Geralt|Especially a druid. Must be a real nature lover.
Geralt|Looks alive.
Geralt|Had one at Kaer Morhen.
Yennefer|Please.
Geralt|A hunter'd loose an arrow if he saw that in the woods.
Geralt|A basin of water…?
Yennefer|For teleprojection.
Yennefer|A reflection of Ermion appears on the surface, supplicants speak to it.
Geralt|Monsters… Can feel 'em… Coming closer… They're everywhere.
Geralt|Strange. Smells of… mushrooms in here.
Yennefer|No… To my mind it's the scent of sweet grass drying in the sun.
Geralt|Pine cone. Didn't expect this. A large female.
Geralt|A child's skull?
Geralt|Goes in for light reading too. "The Corpse of Novigrad" by Sasha Hahdy.
Geralt|Dwarven triple mead.
Geralt|Seems Ermion has real tobacco brought in.
Geralt|Look at this - a detailed map of the Northern Kingdoms. Even shows spheres of influence over the ages…
Yennefer|Out of date.
Yennefer|"Wondrous World of Insectoids," "Ritual Plants"… Ah, what do you know - "Raymond Maarloeve - A Biography Enhanced."
Geralt|Statue's hand looks like it should be holding something.
Yennefer|Ermion enjoys jests achieved at the expense of others. I've a sneaking suspicion the mask will be in here.
Yennefer|It's a trap! We're imprisoned!
Geralt|Cast a spell.
Yennefer|I cannot! The room is shielded.
Geralt|A sword in a stone… Thing's begging me to pull it out.
Yennefer|It's not in the stone, don't you see? It's held there by a vise.
Yennefer|Geralt, come here! I've found the mask!
Yennefer|That's one less!
Yennefer|Help me, Geralt!
Geralt|Yennefer, watch out! Get back! Lemme do what I need to do!
Yennefer|I shan't leave you with this! We'll defeat them together!
Yennefer|Geralt. Hear that?
Geralt|Smelled it. Gas.
Geralt|Grate's still closed. Gotta think of something quick.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What's happening?
Yennefer|You were hallucinating. You ran at Ermion's animals, sword flailing. I had to calm you.
Geralt|Uh, must've looked strange.
Yennefer|Your years of vigorous training at Kaer Morhen finally paid off. Bested nearly all the stuffed beasts in here.
Geralt|Please…
Yennefer|Fine. We've passed the Trial of Taxidermy. The door stands open.
Geralt|Mind if we, uh, never mention this again?
Yennefer|Naturally.
Yennefer|Door's open. We'll proceed as soon as you've collected trophies of your kills.
Yennefer|Get up, Geralt! Hear me?!
Geralt|I can't… I'm dead. They killed me.
Yennefer|It was a needle coated with a toxin. It pricked you when you tried to open the door.
Yennefer|Snap out of it. We've no time to lose.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Looks like Ermion places something in the statue's hand.
Geralt|Whaddaya say we give it a pine cone…?
Geralt|Nothing.
Geralt|So, statue, how about a skull…?
Geralt|Hm… Guess you're no indecisive prince.
Geralt|How about a mug of mead? Statue or not, everybody needs a drink sometimes.
Geralt|Hm, seems like it worked. Who woulda thunk.
Geralt|Need something else. Gotta look around.
Geralt|Let's try again.
<|endoftext|>
Yennefer|My oh my.
Geralt|Missed you.
Yennefer|I missed you too.
Geralt|We oughta get back to the wake.
Yennefer|I must dress. Turn around.
Yennefer|Hm.
Yennefer|Damn. I tore a hole in my dress. Wait a minute, I must mend it.
Geralt|Know how to sew?
Yennefer|Please. I'll enchant a needle.
Yennefer|Wait.
Geralt|For what?
Yennefer|We must talk to Crach.
Geralt|Why? Think he misses us? Because I missed you.
Geralt|Oh no.
Yennefer|I missed you too.
Geralt|When are you gonna finally burn this piece of junk?
Yennefer|My heart couldn't take it.
Yennefer|So many memories.
Yennefer|Dammit, Geralt. Do you have any idea how much they cost?
Geralt|Come here. We gotta hurry. Crach's waiting.
Yennefer|Is that so?
Geralt|Yen, let go of the mane.
Yennefer|I know you. I let go - you throw us off.
Geralt|Ugh.
Yennefer|Don't even try.
Geralt|Really wonder if Crach'll be willing to help…
Yennefer|He knew Ciri well. She and Hjalmar played together as children.
Yennefer|There. Good as new.
Geralt|Let's get back to the wake.
<|endoftext|>
Crach|No specific reason. She and Cerys - they're of a similar age. But we'll speak of my children later. First, let's speak of yours. Yennefer claims Ciri's in trouble, and you seek her.
Geralt|That's right.
Crach|If you require aid - gold, ships, anything - merely say the word. I'll give you all I can.
Crach|And I know the lass lives. I'm sure of it. When the blood of Riannon's daughters is shed, the sea grows white with fury. I'd mark such a storm.
Geralt|Need your help. Ciri probably came here to Skellige…
Yennefer|And very likely caused the cataclysm along the coast. The site upon which the druids focus so intensely now.
Geralt|A site Ermion refuses to let us explore.
Yennefer|Specifically, he won't let me explore it. We fought, we're not friendly now.
Crach|Don't concern yourself with him. Druids have little trust for mages, but Ermion's heart is in the right place. Am I right to assume he does not know you seek Ciri?
Yennefer|It's of no concern to him.
Crach|As I thought. At any rate, Ard Skellig's my isle. You've my permission to investigate as you see fit.
Geralt|Thank you.
Crach|No need. I swore an oath once. I aim to keep it.
Crach|Arnvald!
Crach|Tell the druid I must speak to him. At the usual spot.
Crach|I've one more matter to broach - my children.
Crach|You remember Hjalmar? Well, he swore an oath to kill the giant of Undvik, set off and has yet to return.
Crach|Whereas Cerys announced that she's to set off on an adventure of her own. Got it in her head that Udalryk is not mad, but cursed…
Geralt|I'll talk to Cerys. Count on it.
Crach|I thank you.
Yennefer|Now that we're done thanking one another, let's get to work. We must determine if Ciri is still on Ard Skellig.
Yennefer|I'll change into travel attire and find you.
Yennefer|Head south. The anomaly we should investigate destroyed a stretch of forest along the shore of the bay.
Yennefer|A successful feast on all counts, Crach. I will see you later.
Geralt|I was hoping we could go together.
Yennefer|I'll need my instruments. And there's one thing I must yet verify.
Geralt|If either Hjalmar or Cerys need help, I'll help them.
Geralt|Giants... they've been extinct for ages. Anyone actually seen the one on Undvik?
Crach|Aye. Dozens of refugees have. The giant drove everyone off the isle. I've welcomed what remains of Clan Tordarroch here on Ard Skellig.
Yennefer|I heard a rumor - that an unnatural frost gripped Undvik before the giant appeared.
Crach|Tis true. At any rate, Hjalmar decided to kill the giant and give the isle back to its people. A deed worthy of a king, he believes.
Crach|My son gathered a hearty crew at the New Port. They were to sail to Undvik, then travel on foot to Urskar, a village. But that many lads should've killed the giant long ago. Thus I though to ask you…
Yennefer|You should start at the New Port. Ask around. Hjalmar might've told someone there his plans.
Geralt|Take it Cerys wants to lift the curse.
Crach|There's no curse to speak of. Cerys has decided she must match Hjalmar and sought out a deed worthy of a queen.
Geralt|Think she might need my help? You did plan to ask me for it. Why?
Crach|The thing is, I don't trust Udalryk further than I can spit. Cerys won't listen to me or her brother. Yet confronted by a professional who will explain why she's mistaken, she just might come to her senses.
Crach|So, yes, I ask that you explain things to her and bring her back.
Geralt|Can't help wondering - got no plans to vie for the crown yourself? Think a good number of the jarls would support you.
Crach|A good number? Those opposed would be fierce, rabid. Madman Lugos would sooner see a Nilfgaardian on the throne.
Crach|Besides, a man should know when to step aside, hand the tiller to the youth among us.
Crach|I've one more matter to broach - my child, my lass.
Crach|You remember Cerys? Well, recently she declared she must set off on an adventure. To bolster her chances of winning Skellige's crown.
Crach|Got it in her head that Udalryk is not mad, but cursed…
Geralt|Wondering if I should talk to Ermion…
Crach|Leave that to me. Go, seek and find your Cirilla.
Crach|If any ill befell her here, on Ard Skellig, on my watch, I'd never forgive myself.
Geralt|Magic anomaly on Ard Skellig's somehow related to Ciri, or so Yennefer believes.
Yennefer|It's my strong suspicion. But I can only know for certain by examining the site.
Crach|I saw the twisted forms - right unnatural. The druids were barely able to contain it. Explain to me, Yennefer, how Ciri might've caused this great catastrophe.
Yennefer|I'm intent on learning that very thing. Which I will do as soon as Ermion stops hindering my investigation.
Crach|Any news of Hjalmar?
Arnvald|None, Jarl.
Crach|Gods dammit.
Crach|How was it, Geralt, when Ciri was nearing womanhood?
Crach|I remember well her nan, her mother… what they were like. They say the apple doesn't fall far from the tree…
Geralt|Ciri was impossible to control. No telling her what to do. Had to have things her own way, almost always. Why do you ask?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|I'm looking for men from Undvik.
Navigator|Javor's from the isle. And I once cut those waters with nary a rest. Could trace you the shoreline in me sleep.
Navigator|A lovely excursion, if not for the bloody sirens…
Skellige Fisherman 02|I'm the one to ask! Me or Axel an Tordarroch. He's over there. What can a bloke from Ard Skellig know about Undvik?
Navigator|Heard you trillin' a different tune when Hjalmar was gatherin' his crew… Your love for the an Craite fade that quick?
Skellige Fisherman 02|Bahumum…
Geralt|Need to get to Undvik.
Navigator|Another thrill seeker. Well, then listen close, lest you end in a watery grave.
Navigator|Sail out of port and head southwest. Watch for rocks protrudin' like pricks out the water - you'll have to do some tricky tackin' to get past them.
Navigator|Some of them's shorter, just below the surface, so careful not to scrape right over them. They breech your hull, you're done for, 'cause just a few minutes in that icy water makes a corpse. One time I remember--
Geralt|Stick to the point.
Navigator|Err, um, fine. Watch for the currents, 'cause they can drag you off course, dash you 'gainst the rocks, even. With a bit of luck, you'll land on the same beach where Hjalmar landed.
Geralt|Javor's from there, or so he claims, and you seem to know these waters. Why didn't you sail with Hjalmar?
Navigator|Cause that kind of expedition needs a true leader. And a whelp lookin' to collect bumps on his skull can only be its doom. Once I--
Skellige Fisherman 02|… you'd rather sit on your arse, nose in the air, you Zerrikanian princess?! Brave lad comes along, you sail with 'im!
Skellige Fisherman 02|I'd 'ave sailed with Hjalmar if only those sea-whores hadn't banjaxed my knee. Woulda sailed 'stead of sharin' a table with a grumpy barnacle like you.
Navigator|You'd sail with anyone who'd let you aboard - Crach's daughter included.
Geralt|You mentioned sirens. Many on Undvik?
Skellige Fisherman 02|So, soo many. More'n on other isles.
Navigator|Bollocks…
Skellige Fisherman 02|Once, they attacked Lars and me when we was fishin'. 'Fore we could drive 'em off they'd pulled Lars in the water and scratched me up so bad that… oi!
Geralt|Drive away the sirens? How's that work?
Navigator|Hah! Plain to see you're no islander! With a hornwall's horn. One toot and they ploughin' scurry off so quick the waves rock your boat.
Geralt|Nice talking to you, but time I was on my way. So long.
Navigator|Fair winds to you!
Navigator|Wind blew you in again, eh?
<|endoftext|>
Eight|Look there, crew - White-Hair's returned! What brings you to us?
Geralt|I'm looking for Hjalmar an Craite. Word is he came to this isle with a crew. Aimed to defeat the giant.
Eight|Aye, saw him. As did Wilmar.
Geralt|Sure it was him?
Eight|Wilmar's got eyes like a hawk! They stood where you stand now. Poor shape they were in. Leif the Red, Folan, Vigi…
Eight|Just 'tween you and me, that boy is not quite right in the head.
Eight|Oh, the young an Craite was here, too.
Geralt|They say where they were headed?
Eight|Did they, Wilmar? Oh, aye. Aimed to make camp in the old guard tower.
Eight|Easy enough to find. Stands in the middle of a valley, guardin' absolutely nothin'.
Geralt|Try to come back for you, once I've found Hjalmar.
Eight|Hahaha! Sound awfully sure you'll find him. Maybe you can kill the giant while you're at it? All on your own.
Eight|They're the same to a man, aren't they, Wilhelm? All think themselves immortal.
Geralt|Gotta go. So long.
Eight|Ey, if you really aim to return, mind bringin' me some solid twine? You're like to find it in the village.
Eight|And nails! We're short on nails. Can you remember that? Nails and twine.
Geralt|I'll remember.
Geralt|Thanks for your help. Take care.
Geralt|I should go.
Eight|Fare ye well.
Geralt|Remember when this was?
Eight|When what was?
Geralt|When Hjalmar an Craite was here with his men.
Eight|Oh, that! No, I don't remember. Ya might ask Wilhelm, though.
Geralt|They recognize you?
Eight|No… Thank the gods.
Geralt|You're Harald Houndsnout, jarl of Undvik? Heard you were dead.
Eight|We look like stiffs to you, me and me lads?
Geralt|Er…well…
Eight|Exactly.
Eight|So, they all think me dead, you say?
Eight|Mayhaps it's for the best…
Geralt|I killed the giant.
Eight|Killed 'im? Did what me whole crew couldn't?! Hear that, lads? Are ye not ashamed?
Geralt|When you're done talking to yourself, sail back to Ard Skellig with me.
Geralt|Refugees from Undvik, they've found a safe haven there.
Eight|Aye, they all fled… But see, I promised me crew we'd not leave the isle.
Eight|And we've still got work to do. Oh, she'll be a lovely longship when we're done.
Geralt|Your people have found shelter there. And you're still their leader.
Eight|My people… Oh, aye, they can come back now. Look alive, crew! We've got to hurry.
Eight|Gotta finish her! Oh, she'll be a lovely vessel. Perfect for a funeral.
Geralt|Got nails and twine for you.
Eight|Wha? Oh, yes…
Eight|Finally, poor Wilhelm's ear will stay put…
Geralt|Who were these men?
Eight|My crew. They swore never to leave me. Kept their word.
Eight|Tall one's Wilmar. Wilfred's to his right. And the lad with the stutter's Wilhelm.
Geralt|Why'd you… and your crew… stay?
Eight|We cannot leave. If we ventured it again, the giant would kill us all. Like he did the others.
Geralt|Why'd the giant spare you?
Eight|Me and me crew and the sirens - we're helpin' him build a longship. I sew the sails and run away atimes, and then the sirens fly out and bring me back.
Geralt|Why'd he want a ship?
Eight|He'll sail out on her to defeat the gods durin' the Final Battle 'Fore the World's End.
Geralt|Hm. Think he's had a change of heart.
Geralt|Why'd the giant spare you?
Eight|Me and me crew and the sirens - we're helpin' him build a longship. I sew the sails and run away atimes, and then the sirens fly out and bring me back.
Geralt|Why does he need a ship? Where's he want to go?
Eight|Promise not to tell no one? I trust my men to take the secret to their graves, but you?
Geralt|Promise. Won't tell anyone.
Eight|Fine then. The giant's going to sail her out to defeat the gods come Ragh nar Roog - the Final Battle 'Fore the World's End. She'll soon be ready.
Geralt|Not much game here, but I saw the giant give you food. Where's he get it?
Eight|Don't know, don't ask. Food suits me, suits me crew…
Geralt|Over there, on the ground. Hand's got bite marks on it…
Eight|Wha? Where? Wilmar, dammit, you're supposed to clean up! Couldn't keep a secret if yer life depended on it.
Eight|We had a choice - that or starve to death… But I didn't force anyone, you know. Whole crew voted in favor.
Geralt|I know that song. What're you doing here?
Eight|Look, men, another one. And so many times I've told 'em…
Eight|What's that you say, Wilfred?
Eight|Aye, right y'are, they never learn. Least this one heard a song 'fore he died.

Troll_2|Grrr... Stupid riddle.
Troll_2|Feather, troll not hold, not piss…
Geralt|Snow?
Geralt|I don't have time for riddles.
Troll_3|You in pot!
Geralt|Answer's a whale.
Troll_2|Bad! It troll! Whale no step, idgit! Him in pot!
Geralt|Hang on a minute. It's my turn.
Geralt|A troll, of course.
Troll_2|Grr... Good, troll. Now you asks.
Geralt|Forget it. Just don't feel like negotiating.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|You all right?
Folan|Never go in a sauna again, long as I live. Other than that, I think I'm fine. Ye saved me life. How can I thank you?
Geralt|Thank me with a story.
Geralt|What're you doing on Undvik?
Folan|Sailed here with Hjalmar an Craite aimin' to kill the ice giant. We were to take its head, take back the isle, then bask in the glory, but…
Geralt|Things not go according to plan?
Folan|I've no notion where the others are. Those that survived, that is…
Geralt|Think I know enough. So long.
Folan|Wait, I'll go with you. Luckily the trolls didn't use my bow for kindling.
Geralt|Any idea where Hjalmar thought he might find the giant?
Folan|We'd learned where it has its lair - in the caves above the village. Hjalmar decided the best way there'd be to cross the lake.
Folan|Vigi the Loon insisted he knew a better way - through the mines. But none of us fancied strollin' into a monster pit.
Geralt|How'd you get separated from the others?
Folan|Had the watch for the night. Saw Egnar of Faroe steal Hjalmar's hornwall horn, one he uses to drive away sirens. Bugger snuck outta camp. I followed him.
Folan|No idea what got into that ginger head of his. Told Hjalmar not to take him with us - a thousand times, at least.
Geralt|And? You catch up to him?
Folan|Aye, in these caves. Bastard screeched so loud he drew the trolls. Thought the buggers'd eat me right then. Dropped me in a marinade, instead.
Folan|Decided I was ready to cook today… Woulda been the end of me if not for you.
Geralt|The expedition - tell me about it.
Folan|Started like the best ballads - with a hearty storm. Sail whipped about like a rag!
Folan|Finally caught sight of shore, but then sirens attacked. As if they'd just been bidin' their time!
Folan|But we'd 'ave come through somehow, I know it… if not for the bloody helmsman.
Geralt|Helmsman made a mistake?
Folan|I'd say his ma made the mistake - birthed him arseways or somethin'. Dim, that one. Heard tales and was so afeared of sirens he stuffed wax in his ears. Failed to hear our warnin' calls.
Folan|Steered us right into the rocks.
Folan|Lost a few men, had to drag the wounded on litters. And the sirens pestered us the whole while.
Folan|Hjalmar kept blowin' his horn, but we'd come too close to the hillside and he brought an avalanche down on us.
Geralt|Not your lucky day, it seems. What happened next?
Folan|We found that daft bugger in the ship, then pitched camp near the guard tower.
Folan|Things seemed to calm.
Geralt|You smashed into the rocks. What then?
Geralt|Crach sent me here to find Hjalmar. New king''ll soon be chosen on Ard Skellig. Everybody's waiting for the young an Craite's return.
Folan|So it's started already. Hjalmar, ruler of all Skellige…
Geralt|Doubt he's cut out for it?
Folan|Hjalmar's irresponsible, stubborn and heeds no counsel. But he's a born leader.
Folan|Been mates since we were lads. With him and Cerys.
Geralt|Cerys has put forth her claim to the throne as well.
Folan|Cerys?! But she's-- Well, she's…
Geralt|Like father, like daughter.
Folan|What about Crach? He support her? He let her set off on some daft quest?
Geralt|Wasn't thrilled. Especially since Cerys set out without telling him.
Folan|Nor did she tell me. Where'd she go? Who'd she take with her?
Geralt|Spikeroog. And no one.
Folan|She went alone! Damn the dogs! If Hjalmar'd only… Has she come back? D'you know?
Geralt|Hadn't returned when I left Ard Skellig.
Geralt|Yeah, she's back. Did what she set out to do, too.
Folan|Thank the gods.
Geralt|It was pretty much a shock to everyone.
Folan|Crach, too? Or did he encourage her? Tell her to set off on some mad quest?
Geralt|I'm looking for Hjalmar.
Folan|Hjalmar? Curious where he is meself - him and the whole crew.
Folan|Somethin' must've happened. Otherwise he'd 'ave come lookin' for me after I went missin' that night. I know he would've.
Folan|Wait now... Why're you lookin' for Hjalmar?
Geralt|Let's get out of here.
Geralt|Good. Let's go.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Know the isle well?
Folan|I've never been here before. Guess you could say I've never been fond of Clan Tordarroch.
Folan|In fact, no one on Ard Skellig's especially fond of them.
Geralt|You claim Ard Skelligers don't like the people of Undvik. Yet you helped them after the giant attacked.
Folan|When you save a drownin' man in a storm, d'you ask what clan he's from first?
Geralt|Point taken, I guess, but your people gave them shelter. And now you've come to kill the giant…
Folan|Course we've come. Winnin' back Undvik's the best way to get those folk off Ard Skellig!
Geralt|Any clan out there Ard Skelligers are friendly with?
Folan|Well… certainly wouldn't be those Brokvar cowards.
Folan|They'll say it ain't so, but a hundred years back their jarl walked them off the battlefield just 'cause the enemy showed in greater numbers.
Folan|And Faroe folk are cheats and thieves, everyone knows it. The Tuirseach of An Skellig - always been too big for their britches…
Folan|Now, Madman Lugos' clan… They're all right.
Geralt|Funny, thought they were your greatest enemies.
Folan|They are. But we just can't respect the other clans.
Geralt|Let's get going.
<|endoftext|>
Folan|Bout time… I'd 'ave sprouted roots if the ground weren't so damn hard.
Folan|I'll wait here.
Folan|I'll cover you. Position myself so as to keep the giant in sight.
Folan|Shut your trap! I sat in a bloody troll cauldron with nary a murmur.
Folan|I'll make sure that madman don't run at the giant all alone.
Folan|See you're rarin' to go.
Folan|Wonderful.
Folan|Ehh…
Folan|Sirens… Ploughin' sirens! If they'd just had that blasted horn…
Folan|Wait for you by the ship.
Folan|Thorsten…
Folan|Arvid an Tordarroch. He was dead set on comin' with us…
Folan|Was to be his last voyage…
Folan|Herrik Stormson. Didn't even know him well.
<|endoftext|>
Hjalmar|Hehe. Thanks, White One. If not for you that mighta taken me much longer. And I need to see t' Leif.
Hjalmar|The bitches nearly ripped his innards out. And we two are all that's left of my crew.
Hjalmar|Oh, right. You might not've heard. I'm Hjalmar an Craite. And I'll never forget you helpin' me in a time o' need.
Geralt|Geralt of Rivia.
Hjalmar|The Geralt of Rivia? Like in the ballad about the sorceress and the witcher? You're still alive?
Geralt|Looks like it.
Hjalmar|Right, well, forgive me. Just thought that all happened long ago. My da used to tell me stories of your adventures.
Hjalmar|So… what're you doin' on Undvik?
Geralt|Visiting the isle.
Hjalmar|Very amusing, Geralt of Rivia.
Hjalmar|Everyone knows a true brute's taken over Undvik - the Ice Giant, whom I've come here to defeat.
Geralt|Not about to stop you.
Hjalmar|Then perhaps you'd like to join me?
Hjalmar|With my crew gone, I could use a body at my side. And poor Leif…
Geralt|Leif's dead.
Hjalmar|What? Nah, he's just unconscious. Lost a bit of blood, you know?
Geralt|He's dead. Trust me.
Hjalmar|Swore he'd sink his blade into the giant's heart - swore it on the bones of his ancestors.
Hjalmar|Let's go.
Geralt|I can help.
Hjalmar|Hm…
Hjalmar|Agreed!
Geralt|Your crew - what happened to them?
Hjalmar|Ahh, it all started with a storm - you see, then came the blasted sirens. I had a hornwall horn to drive them off, but one night it just disappeared.
Hjalmar|Next morn the giant ambushed us, crushed half my men. Hurled Arvid against the rocks, tucked Vigi under his arm…
Hjalmar|Just four made it here. But I suppose if it had all gone smoothly, t' woulda made for a dreadfully short ballad about our heroic adventures.
Geralt|Seems more doomed than heroic to me.
Hjalmar|No, that's just the gods lookin' to see what mettle we're made of. They'll soon get their answer.
Geralt|Your father sent me. He needs you on Ard Skellig.
Hjalmar|Impossible. Da knows I'll not return till I kill the giant.
Geralt|Situation's changed. The fate of all Skellige will be decided on Ard Skellig. They're getting ready to choose a new king.
Hjalmar|The fate of Skellige's bein' decided here. If I accomplish this deed, it'll mean the gods have chosen me to rule.
Geralt|The other claimants are already waiting at Kaer Trolde.
Hjalmar|Hm, seems I must hurry then. Time to face the giant. Comin' with?
Geralt|We should see to your friend.
Hjalmar|Right. His wounds need tendin'.
Geralt|Not what I meant. He's dead.
Geralt|Take it you're gonna fight the giant whether I help you or not.
Hjalmar|Of course. But first, I need to patch up Leif, move him where he won't be bothered.
Geralt|Leif's dead.
Hjalmar|Geralt!
Geralt|Farewell, an Craite.
<|endoftext|>
Hjalmar|Folan! Thought you'd died! What happened? Where'd you go?
Folan|What happened's that you mighta listened to me when I told you not to take Egnar! But you don't listen to anyone!
Folan|Know what he did? Stole the hornwall horn, put the whole crew at risk! I followed him…
Hjalmar|Alone! Should've woke me. I'd 'ave listened to you then, but instead…
Hjalmar|Wait!
Hjalmar|Still need to thank you, Geralt of Rivia. I'll never forget you came to my aid.
Geralt|Your father sent me to find you.
Hjalmar|I've the giant to defeat. Head home soon as I've done that. Gotta help Leif first.
Geralt|Leif's dead.
Hjalmar|What? Nah, he's just unconscious. Lost a bit of blood.
Geralt|He's dead. Trust me.
Hjalmar|Swore he'd sink his blade into the giant's heart - swore it on the bones of his ancestors.
Hjalmar|Comin' with me?
Folan|Stupid question.
Hjalmar|Join us, Geralt.
Geralt|You know me?
Hjalmar|Our bards sing ballads about you. And my father told me of your adventures when I was a lad.
Hjalmar|I remember it well - you needn't be a witcher to be a hero. Cold water and a salty breeze - those are a Skellige lad's potions!
Folan|So that ballad 'bout the witcher and the sorceress… that's you?
Geralt|Yeah…
Geralt|Where's the rest of your crew?
Hjalmar|Fought our way through a swarm of sirens to get here. Only a handful of us left after that battle.
Hjalmar|Now we're but three. The sirens tore Leif up good. We should see to his wounds.
Geralt|He's dead.
Geralt|Where's the rest of your crew?
Folan|Good question.
Hjalmar|Fought our way through a swarm of sirens to get here. Only a handful of us left after the battle on the lake.
Hjalmar|Good thing you showed up when you did, 'cause Leif's wounds need tending. Those bitches tore him up good.
Hjalmar|But I suppose that if all had gone smoothly, it woulda made for a dreadfully short ballad about our heroic adventure.
Geralt|Seems more doomed than heroic to me.
Hjalmar|No, that's just the gods lookin' to see what metal we're made of. They'll soon get their answer.
Folan|Ehh…
Hjalmar|Folan! I was sure you'd died! Where've you been?
Folan|Cerys has gone to Spikeroog! Alone!
Folan|Couldn't wait, no, had to sneak off, as if you were afeared someone'd steal the giant out from under you!
Hjalmar|Cerys? She staked a claim to the throne, then? And you'd 'ave rather gone with her?
Folan|I'd 'ave liked to have the choice!
<|endoftext|>
Hjalmar|I'll wait here. But hurry.
Hjalmar|I'll wait at the cave entrance.
Hjalmar|I'm tellin' you, ploughin' enormous whoreson he is!
Hjalmar|Can't believe I finally got the bastard.
Hjalmar|Hurry, now. Pick up the pace!
Hjalmar|Die, fishwhores!
Hjalmar|Hang in there, Leif! I'll soon finish them off!
Hjalmar|I'll gut you!
Hjalmar|Ploughin' fish-bitches!
<|endoftext|>
Vigi|Hey, quick! Let me out 'fore he wakes!
Geralt|Key should be around here somewhere…
Hjalmar|Wait. Know what they call Vigi? The Loon. For good reason, too.
Hjalmar|Best he stay in there till we finish with the giant.
Vigi|What? You out of your bloody mind, an Craite?
Geralt|I thought he was your comrade?
Hjalmar|He is, which is how I know what he's like to do.
Geralt|Let's free him. Giant's pretty big, looks pretty mean. We could use an extra blade.
Hjalmar|Even one swung by a madman?
Vigi|I heard that, an Craite! Let me out right now!
Geralt|Wait here, I'll look for the key.
Geralt|All right, guess he should stay in the cage, then.
Vigi|Whaa?! I'll not forget this, an Craite! You want all the glory to yerself?!
Vigi|Lemme out right now!
Hjalmar|Careful, now… One odd step and you could wake him.
<|endoftext|>
Hjalmar|Ready? Can we go?
Geralt|Let's go.
Geralt|Wanna look around some more.
Hjalmar|In that case, I'll meet you on the beach, near the port.
Hjalmar|Vigi. Poor bugger.
Geralt|Should've let him out.
Hjalmar|Don't blame yourself. Vigi wasn't exactly the predictable type. Soon as he was out, he could've run at the giant brandishing naught but his fists and his prick.
Hjalmar|No tellin' what would've happened. Fight mighta not gone our way.
Hjalmar|Thanks for your help, White Wolf. Geralt the Giantslayer - I'll make sure the skalds set it in song.
Geralt|Sure sounds better than the Butcher of Blaviken. So be it.
Hjalmar|Let's get outta here.
Geralt|"Hjalmar the Giantslayer" sounds better. It was your venture, you deserve the glory.
Hjalmar|Hm. Believe you're right.
Folan|Shouldn't blame yourself. We never knew with Vigi. Might've rushed at the giant bare-fisted soon as he was out.
Hjalmar|And that might've spelled death for us all.
Vigi|Ha! I knew we'd best him!
Hjalmar|Vigi… you daft bastard.
Hjalmar|Hahahaha!
Vigi|Hahahaha!
Vigi|Heeeheheh ahhh… But where are the others?
Folan|Vigi… you daft bastard.
Hjalmar|Hahahaha!
Folan|Hahahaha!
Vigi|Hahahaha!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Gonna head back to Ard Skellig?
Hjalmar|Aye. Need to make it known, tell all how bravely my boys fought. Make their families proud.
Hjalmar|A great many true warriors perished, but victory was ours. The folk of Undvik can go home.
Geralt|Think everyone'll see it that way?
Hjalmar|I'm prepared to take responsibility for their deaths. I was in charge of the expedition.
Hjalmar|And they all believed in me, laid their trust in me.
Geralt|Farewell, an Craite.
Hjalmar|Thanks for your help, witcher. I've a distinct sensation, won't say where, that we'll meet again.
Hjalmar|Aye, after all, I'm to be crowned. I killed the giant, won back Undvik… and lost my entire crew.
Hjalmar|Who else has put forth a claim? Blueboy Lugos, surely, and Otrygg, Svanrige…
Geralt|And Cerys.
Hjalmar|Cerys? Me sis? But she's…
Geralt|She sailed off to Spikeroog. Alone.
Hjalmar|Alone? What on earth was she thinking?
Geralt|Set out to help Udalryk. Don't think she can do it?
Hjalmar|Oh, gods, Cerys…
Hjalmar|Uh, witcher - you wouldn't happen to be headin' to Spikeroog by chance?
Geralt|Yeah, I planned to go there.
Hjalmar|Good.
Hjalmar|Thanks, Geralt.
Hjalmar|I hope we meet again.
Geralt|Farewell, an Craite.
Geralt|Don't know yet.
Geralt|Your father asked me to, but… what if I help her, and she wins, and they crown her queen of Skellige?
Hjalmar|Hahah! Hahaha! You helped me, too. Let's call it evenin' the odds, and leave the rest for the gods to decide.
Geralt|Thought you didn't fully trust them.
Hjalmar|Willin' to give them one last chance. So long, witcher.
Geralt|Mm. So long, an Craite.
Geralt|Probably not.
Hjalmar|Probably? So you may still change your mind? If you happen to be sailin' that way, perhaps you'd…
Geralt|Of course.
Hjalmar|Someone oughta sail after her, stop this foolishness…
Geralt|She's back already. What's more, she was successful.
Hjalmar|Oh…
Hjalmar|She's always liked competin' with me. I've always won in the end so far, though.
Hjalmar|Well, time I was on me way. So long, Geralt. And thanks for your help.
Geralt|So long, an Craite.
Geralt|Surprised everyone.
Hjalmar|And da? Did he support her? Let her set off on some mad expedition?
Geralt|Wasn't pleased. Especially since Cerys didn't mention it to him beforehand.
Hjalmar|Nor to me.
Geralt|Gonna head back to Ard Skellig?
Hjalmar|Aye, after all, I'm to be crowned. I killed the giant, won back Undvik… and lost my entire crew.
Hjalmar|Mayhaps should've set out alone - like Cerys.
Geralt|Regret ever setting out on this expedition?
Hjalmar|What's that matter now? Giant's dead. And the folk of Undvik can go home.
Hjalmar|And Cerys… she back yet?
Geralt|Hadn't returned when I left Ard Skellig.
Hjalmar|Went to Spikeroog, you say… Venture she aims to face whatever's slowly killin' Udalryk.
Geralt|Some say Udalryk's the gods' chosen one.
Hjalmar|They also say the gods are merciful. Witcher, uh, I'm sure Cerys would be glad to see me, but…
Hjalmar|You wouldn't happen to be headin' to Spikeroog?
Geralt|Yes and she did what she set out to do on Spikeroog.
Hjalmar|She's always liked competin' with me.
Hjalmar|Except so far I've always won.
Hjalmar|Well, time I was on my way. So long, Geralt. Thanks for your help.
Geralt|So long, an Craite.
Geralt|Islanders will see it as a great victory.
Hjalmar|Cause Skellige is the victor, whereas I've lost me friends. I've them to thank for makin' me a leader. They believed in me.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|"Sea graves." How the islanders bury their fallen.
Geralt|Clan an Craite emblem. Must be Hjalmar's longboat.
Geralt|Someone dragged a litter through here.
Geralt|Wonder what caused the avalanche.
Geralt|Impaled him on a tree…
Geralt|Clan an Craite.
Geralt|Several men… Dragged a boat north.
Geralt|Two people came through here… Separately.
Geralt|These tracks're older. Somebody left the camp before the attack…
Geralt|Signs of a battle.
Geralt|They fought the giant here.
Geralt|Damn corpse-eaters.
Geralt|Try to break through.
Geralt|Giant tracks.
Geralt|They ran towards the caves…
Geralt|Someone tripped and fell - but managed to get away.
Geralt|Blood. Lots of it.
Geralt|Blood trail leads to the cave.
Geralt|Giant came down the mountain, barged into the village… then kicked the gate down from the inside.
Geralt|The Undvik Massacre, they call it - no exaggeration there.
Geralt|Show me a pantry, and I'll show you the mice.
Geralt|Need to find another way.
Geralt|Lots of old tracks. Giant must've come through here often…
Geralt|Sirens swooped down on 'em… probably knocked them off the bridge.
Geralt|The horn to drive away the sirens. Might come in handy.
Geralt|Sailors sound this in fog, to warn their crews about rocks they spot.
Geralt|No use to me now.
Geralt|Boiled to death…
Geralt|Giant chased them…
Geralt|Fought to the bitter end.
Geralt|Tunnel caved in…
Geralt|Hjalmar lost a lot of men here.
Geralt|Rest of the crew went on… Wonder how many were left.
Geralt|Bled to death…
Geralt|Landed smack in a nekker's lair and cut the beast down. Hardy folk, these Skelligers.
Geralt|Didn't come back for his arrows.
Geralt|Shot him as he fled…
Geralt|One arrow in each… Good eye.
Geralt|Nekkers slowed the pursuer.
Geralt|Someone used this as cover.
Geralt|Archer was determined to kill him… Wonder why.
Geralt|Bleeding heavily… strength probably waning.
Geralt|Got hit here first, but kept going.
Geralt|Got hit good…
Geralt|Kept going… though he could barely walk.
Geralt|Lost a lot of blood, couldn't have gone much further.
Geralt|Hm. Made it quite a ways…
Geralt|Archer finally caught up to him.
Geralt|Now where'd that archer go?
Geralt|Took a second arrow here. Got him good this time.
Geralt|Trolls dragged him into the cave. Wonder if he's still alive.
Geralt|Cornered him. Like a hunter.
Geralt|Must be one of Hjalmar's men…
Geralt|Archer was wounded, too.
Geralt|Hmm... something cooking over there.
Geralt|Throat torn open by claws. Sirens…
Geralt|Scavengers got to this one.
Geralt|Fought barefoot - sirens caught them by surprise.
Geralt|Severed artery, bled to death in seconds.
Geralt|Many wounds, must've fought for a long time.
Geralt|Broken back. As if he fell from a height.
Geralt|Didn't even manage to draw his sword…
Geralt|Hjalmar's encampment. They were attacked.
Geralt|Giant tried to get inside… Looks like he gave up.
Geralt|Clean cut. Head probably went flying.
Geralt|Sliced her up… Two men, looks like.
Geralt|Didn't make it out in time. Two sirens less.
Geralt|Shot half a quiver into her.
Geralt|Split her in two.
Geralt|Hjalmar's man. Bled to death while trying to escape. Wonder what happened to his cohorts…
Geralt|Hm, probably planned to repair it.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Hjalmar seems popular around here.
Skellige Hunter 01|He is Crach's son.
Jonas|Clever lad, put together a fine crew: hearty drinkers and warriors both. Why, the times I've had to piece together tables and benches after hostin' them…
Jonas|The Undvik lads he took on - no spring minnows either. In fact, 'twas a Clan Tordarroch man gave Hjalmar the idea for the expedition. The shipwright, what's his name…
Skellige Warrior 04|Vigi.
Jonas|That's him. Hoped to earn a new byname - "the Fearless." Till now they'd called him "the Loon."
Geralt|They wanted to take back a forge? What's that about?
Jonas|Never heard the Undvikkers forged the best armor in these isles? Their swordsmiths're nothin' to sneeze at, either.
Skellige Hunter 01|Cause we made our blades like the dwarves forge their sihils.
Geralt|Soft, layered core fitted with a hard steel coating.
Skellige Hunter 01|How d'you know? That's a Clan Tordarroch secret.
Geralt|Got some friends who're dwarves.
Skellige Hunter 01|Mayhaps you do, but the ore from the mines of Undvik, why not even… well, no one's got it. That's that.
Geralt|Hjalmar must've had a plan. Tell me about it.
Jonas|Plans?! Hah! They didn't even know where to look for this giant.
Jonas|As I recall, Vigi wanted to cross a frozen lake and scale the mountains.
Skellige Warrior 04|They say the giant came from there, awoken by the frost that gripped the land around the tower.
Skellige Hunter 01|Twas a harsh winter, suited that man-eater perfectly! And it can only get worse! Even the gods… well… hm.
Geralt|Mhm.
Skellige Warrior 04|Another one don't believe Ragh nar Roog is nigh? You'll see… All o' youse!
Geralt|So long.
Jonas|Glad to be of service. If you need to know more about Undvik or the giant, ask Axel, or that 'un over there, Rante.
Geralt|Heard Hjalmar came here to gather men for his expedition.
Jonas|Aye, he did. Such spirit! Stormed in, swept the bowls off the table, jumped atop of it, and cried: "I'm sailin' off to seek glory, who's with me? Who wants to cut off that bloody giant's head?!"
Geralt|Guess that was enough to recruit a longboat full of men.
Jonas|Beh, they carried 'im out on their shoulders! Yellin' all the while, "We'll win back the forge! String that giant up by his gizzards!"
Jonas|Shoulda seen it, witcher. Brought tears to my eyes…
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Warrior 05|Whaddaya want?
Geralt|I'm looking for people from Undvik.
Skellige Warrior 05|They're dead.
Geralt|See, now, I heard many survived.
Skellige Warrior 05|Stubborn git, you are… Whaddaya wanna know?
Geralt|You there when the giant attacked?
Skellige Warrior 05|Aye, I was. One of the jarl's personal guards. Egh. I failed him. Lent no credence to what the priestesses said - that we'd be punished.
Skellige Warrior 05|For robbin' the earth of iron, forgin' it into blades that men kill one another with. That Freya would punish us. Mayhaps they spoke the truth…
Geralt|How did you manage to survive?
Skellige Warrior 05|First I heard the giant growl to those flying sirens. Damn me if he weren't givin' 'em orders!
Geralt|Under stress, men see all kinds of things…
Skellige Warrior 05|I know what I saw! Rushed to help the jarl, but one of the cunts sunk her talons in me, liftin' me up. Tried to take me to their nest, peck me apart, I reckon.
Skellige Warrior 05|But I broke loose of her grip, plummeted from quite a height. Crashed hard, couldn't stand. Last thing I saw - swarm of sirens swooping down on the jarl, thrashing 'round him. He yipped, he yelped, he screamed, he hollered. Then silence.
Skellige Warrior 05|The men escortin' the women and the children to the ships took my unconscious flesh away and brought me to Ard Skellig.
Geralt|Jarl of Undvik - tell me about his death.
Skellige Warrior 05|Jarl Harald Houndsnout… His whole crew died that night. Wilmar, Wilfred, and Wilhelm…
Skellige Warrior 05|I reached them too late. Saw the giant dash Wilmar against a rock.
Skellige Warrior 05|He fell right beside me, all his bones broke, wrigglin' like a salmon on the sand.
Geralt|Harald was dead by then?
Skellige Warrior 05|What? No, jarl fought like a bear! Slicin', and dodgin', and hollerin', then slicin' again. Couldn't save himself though.
Geralt|I should go.
Skellige Warrior 05|Yeah…
Skellige Warrior 05|You again… Really got no one else to bother?
Skellige Warrior 05|Go ask Rante or Javor. Or the innkeep.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Can hear you two clear on the other side of the island.
Ermion|Good! May all Skellige know Yennefer of Vengerberg is a common thief!
Yennefer|Control yourself, druid. I haven't stolen anything. I've merely borrowed something and fully intend to return it.
Ermion|Hah! The generosity! Just one small problem - once used, the mask is rendered completely worthless!
Ermion|Not to mention the risk you'll bury us alive! And all the Isles with us!
Geralt|Bury? What're you talking about?
Ermion|She's not told you? Might've expected as much!
Ermion|The myth is that Uroboros created the Mask when the envious Sea swallowed his beloved.
Ermion|Unable to bear the prospect that he would never again see his betrothed, Uroboros made the Mask, which would allow him to peer into the past.
Ermion|He knew, however, that he could only use it once. So he waited. Waited until his longing grew so strong that it became unbearable.
Ermion|When the Sea learned of the Mask, it was quick to respond. It made known its threat that whosoever used the Mask would bring the Sea's wrath down on them. For in vengeance the Sea would rise and flood all the lands and drown the living.
Geralt|So… No one's ever used the Mask?
Ermion|No… But…
Geralt|So you don't actually know if it works, how it works?
Ermion|Of course I do. The myths tell me.
Geralt|You believe the myths?
Ermion|Only ignorant fools belittle their significance.
Ermion|Besides, it's not the myths that are on trial here! It's the thief!
Geralt|I'm not about to justify what Yennefer did…
Ermion|Then don't!
Geralt|… but try to understand her.
Geralt|She's not doing this to anger you, she's doing it for Ciri.
Ermion|I know there are maternal feelings at play, but this is no excuse, no justification.
Ermion|The Mask of Uroboros belongs to Skellige and should be used for the good of the Isles!
Ermion|If Yennefer uses it now, it shall lose its power, not to mention--
Ermion|Wha… what was that?
Ermion|No! Yennefer's used the Mask!
Geralt|On the one hand a theft. On the other, Ciri's life…
Ermion|I also care deeply for the girl. I proposed a series of other methods. Yennefer refused to listen!
Ermion|She claimed they would take too long, whereas she wants, she needs immediate results!
Ermion|She has always been hot-headed.
Geralt|True. Least this time she's got a valid reason for it.
Ermion|Never mind that she might bring--
Geralt|Theft or no theft, Crach gave us free rein.
Ermion|First off, this might indeed be his isle, but we the druids watch that no alien magic takes hold here.
Ermion|Secondly, after the cataclysm occurred, Crach turned to us for help, entrusted this site to our care.
Ermion|Third--
Geralt|Where'd you get this mask?
Ermion|Sailors from clan Dimun pulled it from the sea. Near the Njord Trench.
Geralt|Yeah, but how can you be sure this is Uroboros' mask?
Ermion|Its appearance is exactly as described in the myths.
Geralt|Don't exaggerate. It's just--
Ermion|No, Geralt. This no "just"!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What was that?
Yennefer|Unicorns.
Geralt|Dammit, Yen, I saw the foglets. I meant how'd they get here?
Yennefer|The power of the Mask summoned them.
Geralt|What now?
Yennefer|The Mask reveals the past, but only in certain places.
Yennefer|Places where past events left a strong magical imprint.
Yennefer|Take it.
Geralt|Want me to wear it?
Yennefer|Yes. I'll cast a spell that will let me see through your eyes.
Geralt|Gonna read my mind again?
Yennefer|You object?
Geralt|You do it whenever you want anyway.
Yennefer|No harm in it then, is there?
Yennefer|Let's go.
Yennefer|Already found the first spot.
Geralt|You know I don't like it.
Yennefer|Let it go. I just want to see what happened.
Yennefer|Besides, you know there are things I'd rather not know about you…
Geralt|Well, let's go.
Yennefer|This way.
Geralt|Ermion says the Mask might cause a natural disaster.
Yennefer|Fortunate he's here then. He can jump right in, try to tame it.
Geralt|Realize he won't let this pass?
Yennefer|Oh, I'll survive, somehow.
<|endoftext|>
Yennefer|It's Ciri's companion and the one who wounded her.
Geralt|How do you know?
Yennefer|I don't. Making an educated guess. They both appeared in the previous visions.
Geralt|Ciri's got a powerful ally.
Geralt|May be something left of the one who got hit by the spell.
Yennefer|It's clearing up.
Geralt|Ermion must be getting a handle on the weather.
Yennefer|Which means he'll be free to attack us again.
Ermion|Are you pleased with yourselves?!
Ermion|Look at what you've brought down on us!
Ermion|If someone's death were to help you find Ciri, would you start making human sacrifices as well?!
Geralt|Just so happens I'm willing to do anything for some people.
Ermion|Everyone else, everything else be damned, is that it?!
Yennefer|Stop panicking!
Yennefer|Here's your Mask.
Ermion|It is worthless. It's an unwieldy ashtray at best.
Ermion|I hope you've learned something useful at least.
Yennefer|Very.
Ermion|I'm talking to Geralt. You… You I'll deal with later.
Ermion|So?
Geralt|Got a feeling we've found something interesting.
Geralt|Just need to examine one more thing.
Geralt|We think a powerful curse was cast here.
Ermion|Hmm… Plausible, considering what happened to the wood.
Ermion|Do you know upon whom?
Geralt|Not yet. But we know Ciri was here. She stepped out of a portal. A mage was with her.
Geralt|Someone chased them, they fought. Ciri was wounded but managed to escape.
Ermion|Where to?
Geralt|Velen, probably - the mage opened a portal for her. Then he fought her attacker.
Ermion|Yes? Is that it?
Geralt|Relax. Storm's died down, you've clearly got things under control.
Ermion|For now! But who knows what will be a week or two on!
Ermion|We'll see what Crach has to say about this!
Geralt|Sure as hell shouldn't be angry. He agreed to help us.
Ermion|When he learns what's happened here…
Geralt|The mage who was with Ciri fled, too. Know where?
Yennefer|Hmm... His trace path leads to Velen as well… But the target coordinates of his portal differ from those of Ciri's…
Yennefer|The explosion must have disrupted his teleportation…
Geralt|Hm, ran into Keira Metz in Velen. Coincidence maybe, but…
Geralt|She claimed a mage came to her looking for Ciri. Be surprised if it wasn't the same one.
Yennefer|Hmm... Whoever he is, he grows more interesting by the minute…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Armor's clean - no blood, no sword nicks. Ciri's friend must've… What do you call it?
Yennefer|Vaporized him.
Ermion|Exquisite, the armor… Though the workmanship's unfamiliar. Can't even tell where it's from.
Geralt|Probably because it belonged to a rider of the Wild Hunt.
Ermion|What?!
Ermion|So it's true… the Wild Hunt… I feared as much.
Ermion|First here, then on Hindarsfjall. What did they want?
Yennefer|They're looking for Ciri.
Ermion|But… why?
Geralt|Elder Blood flows in Ciri's veins.
Ermion|Hmm… 'Tis true she can trace her lineage clear back to Lara Dorren - which is why the women in her family have always had extraordinary abilities…
Ermion|But could that truly be so important?
Yennefer|Ciri's exceptional. She travels between places - here and other worlds. Space is no obstacle for her.
Ermion|Huh?
Geralt|Which is why the Wild Hunt wants to capture her.
Geralt|It's a long story that involves the Elder Blood, Ciri's abilities…
Ermion|Did she, perchance, inherit her mother's skills?
Yennefer|Ciri can do much more than her mother could. But right now we're much more interested in what the Wild Hunt was doing on Hindarsfjall.
Ermion|Well, it happened at least a fortnight after the cataclysm struck here on Ard Skellig.
Ermion|The wraiths raided Lofoten, at dusk, in a blizzard.
Ermion|Itself a strange occurrence for that time of year.
Ermion|The islanders said the wraiths, they barged into their huts. Killed anyone who resisted, then galloped inland, laughing fiendishly.
Yennefer|Anyone survive?
Ermion|A dozen or so women and an old man.
Geralt|Next stop - Hindarsfjall.
Yennefer|I'll meet you on the beach near Lofoten.
Geralt|Wait. Can't we go together? Right now?
Yennefer|But you detest being teleported.
Geralt|Don't exactly like potions either, but I drink 'em when I have to.
Yennefer|Mhm… you also drink them when there's no need at all. Very well, let's go. Stay close to me.
Ermion|Good luck to you. Inform me once you've learned anything new.
Geralt|Mhm. See you there.
Geralt|Speaking of the Hunt - mentioned it appeared on Hindarsfjall.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Looking for Cerys. Heard she stayed here.
Udalryk|An Craite's daughter? Aye, she was here.
Geralt|Where is she now?
Udalryk|Mmm… What?
Geralt|Cerys. Where's Cerys.
Udalryk|Dunno… dunno. Enough of the questions.
Geralt|I'm looking for Cerys. Any idea where she might be?
Hjort|I hope she's gone to the village. It's been a time since she visited. She wished to speak to our folk, but…
Geralt|But?
Hjort|I worry she might've gone to Jarl Udalryk's old family home. Though I tried to dissuade her.
Geralt|Clan Brokvar have something to hide from the an Craite?
Hjort|No, it's not that… The house is a strange place. Many believe it haunted.
Geralt|Great, I love haunted houses. But why would Cerys go there?
Hjort|Before she left, she had a long talk with the jarl. Seems she wanted to help him.
Geralt|With what?
Udalryk|Aaaaa!
Hjort|Forgive me, I must go to him.
Geralt|Where's Cerys?! I've gotta find her!
Hjort|Errr… I don't know. Ask around!
Geralt|Great.
Geralt|A promising start…
Geralt|I say something wrong?
Hjort|You must forgive the jarl. Hasn't been feeling well of late.
Geralt|Is he sick? He didn't seem quite right during Crach's feast, but…
Hjort|We'll be done in a moment.
Udalryk|… And then a giant sea snake swam up and bit my arm off… The gods have spoken: a sacrifice is needed.
Hjort|To my mind it's about you defeating a snake, Jarl.
Udalryk|No. They demand a sacrifice. I'm sure of it. It's time.
Hjort|We must wait for a clearer sign. At least till your next dreaming.
Udalryk|I don't need no more signs.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Greetings.
Skellige Woman 02|Hah, nary a soul for months. Then one day guests from afar start droppin' like rain in springtime.
Skellige Woman 02|You weary, traveler? Hungry?
Geralt|Who're Bergthora and Eiric?
Skellige Woman 02|Years ago, Eiric was close with the old jarl. Was the jarl that helped him win Bergthora's hand. They live towards the east end of the village.
Geralt|Looking for Cerys, Jarl an Craite's daughter.
Skellige Woman 02|Dah! You've found her or near to! Lass was just here.
Geralt|Know where she mighta gone?
Skellige Woman 02|Took an interest in our jarl, asked about his childhood. So I told her to see Bergthora and Eiric.
Geralt|Take care.
Skellige Woman 02|Bless ya, and my blessings to Cerys when you see her.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Greetings. I'm looking for someone.
Skellige Woman 01|Lucky chap you are, then! Truth be told, I'm taken. But village is brimmin' with lovely girls!
Geralt|I'm looking for Cerys.
Skellige Woman 01|The skinny thing? Lovely doe eyes, true, and she's from an honorable house - but the lass is gaunt as a sapling.
Geralt|I don't know where she is, and her father…
Skellige Woman 01|Bah, tell Crach to calm down. No Skellige lass can perish in her own isles.
Skellige Woman 01|All right. She was here a few hours. Went to find me man, Eiric. Needed to talk, she said. They should be on the beach t'other side of the isle.
Geralt|Thanks, take care.
Skellige Woman 01|Good luck searchin'!
Geralt|Did you say lovely girls? Where? Maybe one'd be willing to show me around the island?
Skellige Woman 01|Well, there's Veya, lovely one, cooper's daughter. Though… nah, she's got teeth like fish-hooks.
Skellige Woman 01|Now Debora - there's a fine lass, teeth bang on straight. Though, there is a growth under her right eye…
Skellige Woman 01|Hmm... Maya's got a right dreamy face! If not for that bit of bone rot in her right foot…
Skellige Woman 01|Argh, nuts! Now I give it a think, well, none of these lasses are really appealin'!
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Fisherman 01|Fuckin' muire d'yaebler! Swarmin' like gulls around a waste heap! Ah, be sure we showed 'em!
Geralt|We? Seem to remember you sitting on that rock, crying for help.
Skellige Fisherman 01|Ah, but if not for me warnin', you'd be herrin' bait about now.
Geralt|Thanks for your help. Did it once, maybe you can do it again.
Skellige Fisherman 01|Well, I'll have to think about it. Busy today wi' me fishin', got nets to mend. No time to fight monsters.
Geralt|It's not drowners this time. It's Cerys. I'm looking for her.
Skellige Fisherman 01|Aye, fine-lookin' girl. Can tell right away she's from a good clan. Left her sittin' right here when I sailed out to bring in the morning catch.
Geralt|Any idea why she came here? She say what she was after, or just admire the scenery?
Skellige Fisherman 01|She asked about our jarl and his family.
Skellige Fisherman 01|Went to Udalryk's old family home. Yonder, on the hill.
Geralt|Thanks. Farewell.
Geralt|She say where she was headed?
Skellige Fisherman 01|Hmm… Wouldn't tell a stranger, but we did risk our hides together.
Geralt|And if not for me, you'd have sat on that rock till you died and rotted.
Skellige Fisherman 01|For the love of Freya! All right! Have it your way! You saved me, now what? What, need I march around the country singin' out your praises?!
Geralt|No, just tell me where to find Cerys.
Skellige Fisherman 01|Must be daft! You helped me with the sea devils, but that don't mean I'm willin' to gossip 'bout an Craite's daughter!
Geralt|I'm here at her father's behest. Cerys has been away a while, Crach asked me to make sure she's all right.
Skellige Fisherman 01|Shoulda said so at the start.
Geralt|Cerys was supposed to be at Udalryk's but wasn't. I'm starting to worry.
Geralt|Think for a minute: If not for the jarl, would I know to look for her here?
Skellige Fisherman 01|Ah, right. So it's like the jarl himself sent ye.
Geralt|Where's Cerys? Tell me.
Geralt|Here are your options: tell me where Cerys is, or I'll tell everyone I found you sitting on a rock, scared witless and screaming like a woman.
Skellige Fisherman 01|Ah! Talk all you want. No one'll believe a foreigner tellin' tales about an islander.
<|endoftext|>
Cerys|You and my da - you were mates once, right?
Geralt|Hope we still are.
Cerys|But… Well I heard you fell out over somethin'… or someone…
Geralt|Talking about that story with Yennefer?
Geralt|Long time ago, that. In fact, that was before Crach met the woman who'd be your mother.
Cerys|But you and Yennefer'd already met?
Geralt|Err, things were never cut-and-dried with Yen.
Cerys|What is it about her? What is it that draws you?
Geralt|Dunno… Maybe, uh, it's 'cause I've never chosen comfort and ease, the calm and the quiet…?
<|endoftext|>
Cerys|Wha-- What happened? Where am I?
Cerys|Oooo… My head - pain's just awful…
Geralt|Got hit, with something heavy.
Cerys|Geralt… Why're you here?
Geralt|Came to look for you. Crach's worried.
Geralt|Taking you home.
Cerys|I won't go until I help Udalryk.
Cerys|The sword! Where's the sword?! I've gotta go back!
Geralt|You're not going anywhere. I carried you out of there a moment ago, half dead.
Cerys|I have to--
Geralt|You have to tell me what's going on.
Geralt|So what's this sword all about?
Cerys|It's Brokvar, the ancestral sword of Udalryk's clan. I need it to lift the curse that holds Udalryk.
Geralt|A curse?
Cerys|Long story. Years ago Udalryk and his little brother butted heads over the sword.
Cerys|As custom has it, the clan sword should go to the firstborn son - Udalryk. But his father gave Brokvar to his little brother - Aki.
Geralt|Huh, serious insult in these lands.
Cerys|Serious enough for Udalryk to break a sacred law here in Skellige - he openly questioned his father's decision.
Geralt|Guessing the old jarl couldn't let it pass?
Cerys|They chained Udalryk to a pile, up to his waist in the sea. Spent three days like that. When his punishment ended, he and Aki sailed out to fish.
Geralt|Most likely their father thought some hard work at sea together would fix things between them…
Cerys|We use sea outings as cures for many things… Sadly, this time it didn't work.
Cerys|A storm broke out and Aki fell overboard. Udalryk had his hands full with the sails. Didn't hear his brother until it was too late.
Geralt|Didn't hear… or didn't want to hear…
Cerys|Some folk on the isle had the same doubt, but none would mention it aloud.
Geralt|What'd you plan to do with the sword?
Cerys|I thought Aki's ghost would want it back…
Geralt|The brother's ghost?
Cerys|Long as I remember, folk've said Udalryk's the chosen one, the one the gods speak to.
Cerys|I believed it once, but now, considerin' certain things… I think he's just haunted, and it's his dead brother that's hauntin' him.
Geralt|So you believe Aki's getting his revenge. 'Cause Udalryk let him die?
Cerys|I've talked to Hjort. He swears Udalryk didn't start hearin' voices till after Aki's death. And I don't think Hjort's mistaken, he knew both those boys from the cradle.
Cerys|I think we've to give Brokvar to Aki, and he'll leave Udalryk alone.
Geralt|Not a bad idea - on condition it's a ghost we're dealing with. But something doesn't add up…
Cerys|What's that?
Geralt|Aki drowned at sea - said so yourself. But the ghost haunts this house.
Cerys|Aki and Udalryk both lived here. Maybe that's why.
Cerys|Thanks for your help, Geralt, but I've gotta get the sword.
Geralt|Out of the question. I'll get it.
Cerys|Really? Thanks. So I can go see Udalryk.
Geralt|No chance. You're weak. Might pass out again along the way. Wait here, we'll go together.
Cerys|Besides, now we've got the sword, we'll soon see if that's what it's about.
Geralt|Hmm, no harm in trying, I suppose.
Geralt|Let's go see Udalryk. Be interesting to see if there actually is a ghost in all this.
Geralt|Daring theory… Not breaking any of your laws just by thinking it?
Cerys|Don't care. I don't believe it's the gods talkin'. Have you seen him? He's covered in scars.
Geralt|Thought he earned those in battle.
Cerys|If you call the strife in his heart and head a battle…
Cerys|I asked him about it. He said the voices command him to hurt himself - for the glory of the gods.
Cerys|I think not. It's not the gods, it's Aki.
Geralt|What do you think? Did Udalryk kill Aki?
Cerys|I don't want to jump to any conclusions. But I do think whatever happened at sea that day, well, it's affecting Udalryk right now, powerfully so.
Cerys|And it could have somethin' to do with that sword.
Geralt|Got a feeling this trip didn't end happily…
Cerys|Your feeling's right. There was an accident.
Geralt|Why'd you go in there?
Cerys|I wanted to help Udalryk…
Geralt|Sure, he was acting strangely, but I don't see how your stroll through a haunted house will help him.
Cerys|It would've, if I'd only found the sword.
Geralt|For a sword? Mean this one?
Cerys|You have it?! Then what're we waiting for? We've got to see Udalryk!
Geralt|And you have a theory about the voices, what they might actually be…
Cerys|I've asked around, here and there, visited our druids on Ard Skellig and Freya's priestesses on Hindarsfjall. And I've talked to Hjort.
Geralt|I take it your suspicions were confirmed.
Cerys|Priestesses and druids wouldn't say much. But they agreed there's not much in the holy tomes about the gods commandin' folk to hurt themselves.
Cerys|Hjort was the one really got me thinkin'. He told me Udalryk started hearin' voices right after Aki's death. Hjort thought that important.
Geralt|So Hjort also doubts Udalryk's been chosen by the gods.
Cerys|He's loyal to the clan, so he'd never say openly. But he suggested that Udalryk's troubles likely come from Aki.
Geralt|Hmm… So you think it might be Aki's ghost, not the gods?
Geralt|This Hjort… Who is he, exactly?
Cerys|A druid. Been servin' the Brokvar clan since Agnar, Udalryk's granddad, was jarl.
Cerys|Da says he's the only reasonable man in the whole clan.
Geralt|Crach could be right. Seems Hjort gave you a good lead.
Geralt|I found it. Let's go.
Cerys|After you, then.
Geralt|Not yet. Wait for me.
Cerys|So? D'you find the sword?
Geralt|What else would Skellige boys fight about?
Geralt|Let me guess. The sword was supposed to go to the first-born, but their father decided it would be the younger brother's?
Cerys|You know our customs well.
Geralt|Well enough to know Udalryk probably considered that a serious insult.
Geralt|Hm, seems Udalryk was very brave when young…
Geralt|Or very foolish…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|It's not the gods.
Udalryk|Watch your words, foreigner. You're in Skellige, our land, and we revere the gods here. If you weren't an Craite's guest…
Hjort|Jarl, the witcher surely meant no offense. Let us hear what he has to say.
Geralt|More likely this is somehow related to your dead brother.
Cerys|I told Geralt of Aki. We concluded that--
Geralt|That the gods are angry at you, yet he's the reason. That's why you have to apologize - to Aki himself.
Udalryk|I… I didn't want to… Aki fell in the water… I… the gods will be angry.
Geralt|Angry you want to make peace with your brother? Are the gods of Skellige that cruel?
Udalryk|They are that just.
Hjort|Justice demands you return to the dead what is rightly theirs.
Udalryk|What would you have me do?
Geralt|Remember where Aki fell in the water?
Udalryk|Near the isle's eastern end, by the mouth of the bay. Current had swept us towards Ulula's Needle.
Hjort|It's a dangerous spot. Treacherous eddies swallow a handful of sailors each year.
Geralt|We need to sail there. Aki's ghost won't rest until Brokvar's returned to his remains.
Udalryk|No, no, no, no!
Udalryk|The gods. They'll be angry… I feel it.
Hjort|Fear not, Jarl. The gods love you, and they loved Aki. Surely they want this.
Geralt|Well, maybe I can sail there. The sword should be returned - that's what matters. Makes no difference by whose hand.
Geralt|What do I look for? Did Aki have anything that'll help me recognize him? Something he was wearing that could survive all this time under water?
Udalryk|Aye… Our clan ring.
Geralt|That oughta be enough. I'm off.
Geralt|Lemme help you. And I promise to do everything I can to keep from angering the gods.
Hjort|Heed the witcher, Jarl. Make amends to Aki and you'll surely please the gods.
Udalryk|Horridly bright out here. Stings the eyes.
Hjort|The fresh air will do you good.
Udalryk|The gods won't be pleased.
Geralt|Ahem
Hjort|Jarl, our guests, remember?
Geralt|Couldn't help overhearing your conversation.
Udalryk|No worries. It's no secret.
Cerys|All in the Isles know Jarl Udalryk hears the voices of the gods.
Geralt|These voices you hear…
Udalryk|The gods. Their voices.
Geralt|What happened to your hand?
Udalryk|I sacrificed it to the gods.
Cerys|Forgive him, Jarl. Geralt's got more to learn about our customs.
Cerys|We're close to the gods in Skellige. And the chummier y'are are, the greater the offerin' you make.
Cerys|It's our belief the greatest thing a man can offer is his pain, his suffering - the pure sacrifice.
Udalryk|To hear the gods is a gift, not a sacrifice.
Cerys|Where's Yennefer?
Geralt|Hmm… Don't know… Why do you ask?
Cerys|I just wonder why she let you come here alone.
Geralt|What do you mean, "let me"?
Cerys|Nothin', not a thing… Just got the impression she doesn't like to let you out of her sight.
Cerys|Look, there they are.
Geralt|You've made the right choice.
Hjort|I believe so as well.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What is this?
Cerys|Udalryk… The voices commanded him to poke out his eye.
Geralt|What?
Geralt|Why'd you do it?
Udalryk|Such was… the will of the gods. A sacrifice… for Aki.
Geralt|What'd the gods want? Exactly. Do you remember? What'd they tell you?
Udalryk|They were angry.
Udalryk|A voice said, "You vile wretch. You didn't help Aki, and now you failed to sail out to beg his forgiveness."
Udalryk|"Poke out your eye. Suffer, and regret the evil you've wrought."
Geralt|I returned the sword, but nothing's changed. It's not his brother's ghost that haunts him, tortures him.
Cerys|What's wrong with him?
Geralt|Can we talk somewhere in private?
Cerys|The guest room. Come.
Geralt|The gods speak from the shadows, you said. Is that why you don't allow any lights in here?
Udalryk|In my dreams. Atimes I see their form. When the torches burn bright.
Geralt|To see the gods is a great honor. Maybe, with more light in your house, you'd see them when you're awake as well?
Udalryk|Lesser men are unworthy, they cannot gaze upon their faces.
Geralt|The gods always demand you offer them your suffering?
Udalryk|Only that pleases them, so they ask for more and more.
Geralt|The gods ever show you their form? Or are they always just a shadow?
Udalryk|Once, I steeled myself, gathered my courage, and in my dream made my torch burn bright. I saw a hazy figure sitting in shadow then.
Geralt|When'd the gods speak to you? Right after I left?
Udalryk|Shortly after. Sleep came over me, so I lay down. 'Twas then they revealed their will to me.
Geralt|You always asleep when they speak to you?
Udalryk|Always.
Geralt|What do you see then? Do they try to summon you anywhere specific?
Udalryk|My old home. They command me to light torches, then speak from the shadows.
<|endoftext|>
Cerys|Well? Know what it is?
Geralt|It's a hym. A post-Conjunction creature, very rare and very dangerous. It latches onto men who commit vile deeds.
Geralt|It feeds on their pain for years, fueling their guilty conscience. In the end, hyms force their victims to mutilate themselves.
Cerys|Sounds unpleasant. Any way to defeat it?
Geralt|Hmm… two methods that work. In theory.
Geralt|Witchers' bestiaries say you have to spend a night in the hym's lair. With the affected individual.
Cerys|The haunted house, you mean? It's hardly cozy, but I wager you've slept in worse conditions.
Geralt|It's not about sleeping. You've gotta draw the hym out. It has to emerge from the shadows, show itself.
Geralt|Can't hurt it otherwise.
Cerys|And it's sure to give as good as it gets.
Geralt|You've seen Udalryk. It won't be an easy fight.
Cerys|What's this other way?
Geralt|They say a hym can be tricked. You have to pretend to do something horrible. Then it'll move on to you as its new victim.
Geralt|When it realizes it's been tricked, it'll be forced to leave.
Cerys|Great! Let's try it!
Geralt|Don't know anyone who's pulled it off.
Cerys|Well maybe no one's thought up a trick that was good enough.
Cerys|I know you're doubtful, but we should at least try to find a way to trick the hym.
Geralt|Might not be as simple as it seems. Besides, neither method's perfect.
Cerys|What d'you mean?
Geralt|Udalryk might not survive an entire night in the hym's lair.
Cerys|You think the hym… would it try to kill Udalryk?
Geralt|No. That would mean losing its host.
Geralt|But Udalryk could just… expire. He's weak, and the house will summon painful memories. Whereas to the hym, that'll be an opportunity.
Geralt|The more pain the hym causes Udalryk, the stronger it'll grow.
Cerys|And the more dangerous it will be to you.
Cerys|Both methods seem risky… But I still think we should try the trick.
Geralt|Don't know that I'm convinced.
Cerys|Just please don't tell me you have to consult Yennefer on such things as well.
Cerys|If we fail to think of anythin', we can always try the witchers' way.
Geralt|Hmm… Trying the trick can't hurt.
Cerys|Good decision.
Geralt|Haunted house, the hym's lair - only place where anything like this could work.
Geralt|No reason to delay.
Geralt|Meet you there. Got something to tend to on the way.
Cerys|Fine. See you.
Geralt|What is it with you and Yennefer? Mentioned her several times already.
Cerys|Nothin'. I've just noticed that… you're often of one mind.
Geralt|Saying I'm hen-pecked?
Cerys|Not that you're especially different… Seems to happen to all men…
Cerys|Take a rowdy Skelliger, a brave knight or a tough witcher - you all end up wrapped around some woman's finger.
Geralt|What can I say… you've seen through us all.
Cerys|So. Shall we try trickin' it first?
Geralt|Yeah. Let's.
Geralt|Uh-huh. So to prove you wrong, I gotta do what you say now?
Cerys|As long as my name's not Yennefer, no one would call you hen-pecked for that.
Cerys|And remember, if we can't think of a good trick, we can still do it your way.
Geralt|Fine. Let's try to trick the hym.
Cerys|Hmm… And what about the other method?
Geralt|The hym's a demon, and demons are notoriously hard to fool. Plus, the trickster can't know it's a trick.
Cerys|What?
Geralt|The hym attacks those who have a guilty conscience, truly believe they committed a foul deed. The hym strengthens their regret and feeds on it.
Geralt|Meaning… if the new host doesn't feel true sorrow, the hym'll sense that.
Cerys|Yes. So for this to work, if either of us has an idea, we can't tell the other one about it.
Geralt|Exactly.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Hope you know what you're doing…
Cerys|So do I…
Cerys|So? Can we start?
Geralt|I'm ready.
Cerys|All right. I'll be back soon.
Cerys|In the meantime, get a fire goin' in the oven.
Geralt|I don't know what you have in store for me. Gotta prepare, at least a little.
Cerys|All right. Let me know when you're ready.
Geralt|You're asking me to put my life at risk, Udalryk's life at risk. I can't do that.
Geralt|I prefer witchers' methods - tried and true.
Cerys|I see. If something were to go wrong, it’s true… So be it. Let's get Udalryk.
Cerys|But you'll have to tell him what this witchers' method's about.
Geralt|No reason to wait.
Geralt|Wanna look around some more. Meet you there.
Geralt|Come up with anything?
Cerys|Yes, I've a plan - one that just might work.
Geralt|Can I get any details?
Cerys|You've got to wait for me here. I won't be long.
Geralt|Uhhh, anything else…?
Cerys|Said yourself - you can't know the details. So no, nothing else. You simply gotta trust me.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|I know what haunts you, whispers in your ear, commands you to hurt yourself.
Geralt|It's neither the gods nor your brother.
Udalryk|But I hear it, clear as a bell. The voice speaks.
Geralt|The voice is that of a hym. The creature feeds on the guilt you feel for not helping Aki.
Geralt|Good news is we can defeat it.
Hjort|And the bad?
Geralt|We gotta survive a night in it's lair - your old house.
Udalryk|No. No, no! That'll end badly. It can't end well, I can feel it.
Geralt|Get yourself together. If we're to stand a chance, you need to be strong. You need to be a Skelliger.
Udalryk|I am a Skelliger.
Geralt|We need to prepare the house first. Light some torches in the main room - make sure they illuminate every nook and cranny.
Udalryk|And then?
Geralt|Then you just need to show up. I'll take care of the rest.
Hjort|Fear not, Jarl, we'll tend to everything. You should rest in the interim.
Hjort|Witcher, there's an old shed beside the house. It was used for storing tools and such.
Hjort|You might find torches there.
Geralt|Thanks.
Hjort|Wait here a moment. I'll fetch some torches.
Hjort|Will that suit you?
Geralt|Should do. Thanks.
Geralt|Good idea. Meantime, I'll place the torches.
Geralt|There's no sense in going if you don't stay calm.
Hjort|Jarl, the witcher is right. He specializes in such matters, he's your only chance.
Geralt|What Cerys did - don't hold it against her. She wanted to help, banish the voices that haunt you.
Udalryk|Help? Casting my babe in an oven?!
Geralt|Things'll calm down, you'll talk, figure it out. She had the best intentions. Important you know that.
Udalryk|Yet she did not win your trust.
Geralt|Cause I decided to solve this the witchers' way.
Udalryk|No, no, no, no…
Udalryk|It'll never end…
<|endoftext|>
Cerys|Udalryk…
Udalryk|Begone, lass.
Cerys|I'd never let your babe be hurt. You know that.
Udalryk|Yet you almost killed 'im!
Cerys|It was a trick. We wanted to cheat the creature that haunts you.
Cerys|Not a hair on the tyke's head would've been harmed.
Cerys|There's a door the other side. I'd 'ave pulled the little one from the oven right away, no flames would've touched 'im.
Cerys|The hym would've thought Geralt killed the child. He'd 'ave abandoned you for the witcher.
Cerys|But when he saw your son safe and sound, he'd 'ave had to go.
Udalryk|Argh…
Udalryk|What you did… It's hard to believe any good could've come of it.
Udalryk|On the other hand, I've known you since you were a child… You're Crach's daughter.
Udalryk|I know you've never harmed another mindfully…
Udalryk|Argh, let's leave it be, leave it be.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Warrior 01|O'er there! She's runnin' to the old house!
Udalryk|Grab her!
Cerys|Take him!
Cerys|You must put him in the oven! Trust me.
Udalryk|Take care not to hurt the child!
Udalryk|Give me the babe.
Cerys|In the oven! Throw him in the oven!
Geralt|Cerys had a plan. But we'll do it my way.
Udalryk|I'll deal with you later.
Udalryk|Let's go.
Cerys|The hym won't leave on its own. This isn't over.
Geralt|Just made yourself an enemy.
Cerys|I'd 'ave made no such thing if you'd only trusted me.
Geralt|And tossed an infant in the oven? I don't think so.
Cerys|The babe would've been fine. Round back the oven there's another door. I'd 'ave pulled the child out before the flames could even warm him.
Cerys|The hym would've thought you'd killed the tyke, it would've abandoned Udalryk. I'd 'ave showed it the babe then, safe and sound. It would've had to go.
Geralt|Hmm… Not a bad scheme. Just… risky. I'd rather do it the witchers' way.
Geralt|Lemme talk to Udalryk. I'll explain what you wanted, what happened here.
Udalryk|Arrrgghh!
Udalryk|Ugh!
Udalryk|Ugggh!
Udalryk|Why…?
Udalryk|Aki!
Cerys|The witcher committed no crime. You'll find neither despair nor guilt here. Only shock and relief.
Cerys|You've been tricked. You must go.
<|endoftext|>
Cerys|Geralt! Wait!
Geralt|What is it?
Cerys|When I spoke of men, how they're… about you and Yennefer…
Geralt|About how she's wound me tight around her finger?
Cerys|I was wrong to say that, wrong about you. The way you trusted me, a complete stranger almost - it was something.
Cerys|Few men would've had the courage.
Geralt|Appreciate it if you didn't tell everybody in the Isles. They'll think I enjoy being dominated…
Cerys|Haha. Farewell, Geralt.
Geralt|See you, Cerys.
Geralt|It's over.
Udalryk|Over?
Geralt|We tricked the hym. It thought I'd killed your child, abandoned you to haunt me, feed on my conscience.
Cerys|But when it saw the babe was whole, unharmed, it had to go. You're free, Jarl!
Udalryk|Free…
Geralt|The hym's gone. So are the voices that tortured you.
Geralt|Let's get out of here.
Udalryk|What's happening? My head's spinning… I'm spinning in a maelstrom…
Cerys|Geralt, you said it was over.
Geralt|That's just fatigue. In time his mind'll return to normal.
Udalryk|What… what will I do now?
Geralt|You'll be fine. Key is to not give in to self-pity.
Udalryk|I feel… as if someone's torn something from me.
Geralt|That's normal. The hym was a parasite. Bonds between parasites and hosts can be strong. That's why you feel empty now.
Geralt|Give it a few days, weeks, you'll be fine.
Udalryk|Thank you… I think. Farewell.
Cerys|I'll go with him. He seems confused.
Geralt|Good idea. Then what? What're your plans?
Cerys|I'll stay a few days, make sure he's healthy. And you? Gonna stay on Spikeroog?
Geralt|Don't know yet. Gotta gather my thoughts.
Cerys|I'm sure Yennefer must be growin' impatient…
Geralt|Generalize much? I'd say when someone's got a good idea, there's no reason to deny it - and whether they're man, woman or dwarf doesn't come into play.
Cerys|Is that why you wouldn't trust me with the hym? It was just a bad idea?
Geralt|No. Just opted to do it my way.
Cerys|Worked out in the end. That's important. Thanks for your help.
Geralt|Don't mention it. Farewell.
Cerys|Though I will admit you're not all bad. You trusted me - a complete stranger nearly. Few would've had the courage.
Geralt|Must be. And the lioness is best not vexed, so time I was on my way. Farewell, Cerys.
Cerys|See you, witcher.
Geralt|Thought we already discussed that.
Cerys|We did. Farewell, witcher! Favorable winds and following seas to you!
Geralt|To you too. So long.
Geralt|Good idea. Take care of yourself.
Geralt|You're disoriented, but don't worry, it'll pass.
Cerys|Well?!
Geralt|It worked.
Geralt|I killed the hym. You're free.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Let's start. Think pleasant thoughts, don't let the hym drag you into guilt.
Geralt|And pray to your gods I'm not wrong.
Geralt|Not yet. Gotta check one last time if everything's in place.
Geralt|So? Ready?
Udalryk|A Skelliger's always ready. To defeat his foes or fall in battle tryin'.
Geralt|Only one to fall today'll be the hym.
Udalryk|Need I prepare? What will happen?
Geralt|Ignorance is bliss, trust me.
Geralt|Just make sure you stay vigilant, listen to what I say.
Udalryk|Fine. So… What now? Shall we begin?
Geralt|I'll light the torches in the main room. That and your presence'll enrage the hym eventually. It'll show. That'll be my chance to hurt it.
Udalryk|And me? What am I to do?
Geralt|Just hold out. It'll whisper to you, tell you to do things. Could be more intense than usual. Definitely won't try to kill you, though.
Udalryk|I'll keep it together. I'll try.
Geralt|That's great, but if it's not enough, if the hym starts to get to you, I'll use a Sign that'll calm you down.
Udalryk|So be it. Shall we start?
Udalryk|Shall we start?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Greetings, Yen.
Yennefer|Good thing you're here… The frostbite was starting to set in.
Geralt|You should've dressed warmer.
Yennefer|Mhm. Next you'll be pinning mittens to my coat. Can we go?
Geralt|Yeah.
Yennefer|Quite a few years since I was last on Hindarsfjall. But if I remember correctly, Lofoten should be this way.
Yennefer|Razed huts and fresh graves. Hm, this must be it.
Geralt|Gathering of some kind… We've come at a bad time.
Yennefer|There's no good time to talk about the Wild Hunt.
Geralt|Had a matter to tend to.
Yennefer|A matter that brooked no delay, I presume… What was it? A nekker contract?
Geralt|Something like that. Can we go?
Yennefer|Mhm.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|This Morkvarg… half-man, half-wolf?
Skellige Priestess 02|Yes…
Geralt|Won't bother you anymore. Already killed it.
Skellige Priestess 02|And yet bother us he does.
Geralt|Impossible. I split him open from head to…
Skellige Priestess 02|You were not the first. Several brave lads have cleaved the beast… But Morkvarg always returns.
Skellige Priestess 02|I know… Craven went there before you but has yet to return.
Geralt|Didn't see him in the garden… Doesn't bode well. Don't know if there's much point in going there.
Yennefer|Even if he's dead… we could find some clues near his body.
Geralt|Let's hope.
Geralt|Morkvarg? What's that?
Skellige Priestess 01|Who, you mean…
Skellige Priestess 02|The vilest man ever to inhabit Skellige. Nothing was ever sacred to him. He attacked his own clan's lands, took gold from Nilfgaard, killed children, pregnant women…
Geralt|Mhm. Know the type.
Skellige Priestess 02|They said he feared only one thing - the wrath of the gods. Morkvarg sought to prove how wrong they were. So he sailed to Hindarsfjall to ransack the goddess' garden. This was over a decade ago.
Skellige Priestess 01|Arch priestess Ulve stood in his way. He thrust a blade between her ribs and cast her down in the mud. As her lifeblood left her, she cursed him… And Morkvarg transformed into a beast.
Yennefer|A curse, a monster… You've got some work to do…
Geralt|I can get rid of Morkvarg. Don't know what he's turned into, but a silver sword should do the trick.
Skellige Priestess 01|It's not that simple. There have been those who have bested Morkvarg… Yet he always returns.
Geralt|I'm not here to work.
Yennefer|I doubt Morkvarg cares. Monsters prowl when they will and where they will.
Geralt|Fine. He comes within reach of my sword, I'll deal with him… But only then.
Geralt|Where is this holy garden?
Skellige Priestess 01|Not far from here… North. We cultivated healing herbs there once…
Yennefer|And now?
Skellige Priestess 02|Now we walk only as far as the tree the goddess planted. We place our offerings and make our pleas before it.
Skellige Priestess 01|Those who venture below… remain in the garden, forever.
Geralt|A coward who willingly seeks battle… Am I the only one who sees the contradiction?
Skellige Priestess 01|That's why he did it. Craven knew he would prove the elders wrong only if he killed Morkvarg.
Skellige Priestess 02|And thus regain his honor - and his name.
Yennefer|Trial by ordeal. Very Skelligan.
Skellige Priestess 02|I do not mock your laws - please also respect ours.
Geralt|Thanks for your help.
Skellige Priestess 01|I understand you intend to enter the garden?
Skellige Priestess 01|I dislike it when foreigners enter the sacred grounds… But so be it.
Skellige Priestess 02|Custom demands pilgrims make an offering of their own blood before the tree. Craven surely did so… Unless he lacked not only courage but respect for Freya as well.
Yennefer|You needn't worry about us. Geralt and I always give the gods the respect they are due.
Geralt|Ritual of some kind… We'll have to wait.
Yennefer|We'll do no such thing.
Yennefer|Dear sisters… Pardon the interruption, but we've an important matter to discuss.
Skellige Priestess 03|Can you not see we're commemorating the dead? So…
Yennefer|And we're looking for someone who's still alive. Please… This is urgent.
Skellige Priestess 01|Ugh. Then speak.
Geralt|We're looking for a young woman, name of Ciri. Ashen hair, green eyes...
Skellige Priestess 01|I'm sorry. She is not here.
Skellige Priestess 03|Unless she lies in a grave… That is, I do not recall one by that name, but I've buried so many… I may have forgotten.
Skellige Old Woman 02|This… This Ciri… Has she a scar? Here, on her cheek?
Yennefer|Yes, yes. What happened to her?
Skellige Old Woman 02|Don't know. Saw her but for a moment, right before… before it all. She was in the stables with… Craven.
Skellige Woman 05|A thousand curses upon him.
Geralt|This Craven you mention… Does he have a name?
Skellige Priestess 01|He did… Until the elders struck him from the Saga of Ancestors.
Skellige Priestess 02|It's as if he has ceased to exist. The law forbids anyone from touching him, speaking to him… Even uttering his name.
Yennefer|What did he do to deserve that?
Skellige Woman 05|He fled from the Wild Hunt… He alone!
Geralt|We need to talk to him… Even if it's not in keeping with your customs.
Skellige Priestess 01|You've come too late. He went to the garden, to fight Morkvarg.
Geralt|Remember anything else? Anything at all?
Skellige Old Woman 02|Only that she seemed tired. Very tired. And… and her hair was wet.
Yennefer|Great, so we know she bathed. Progress.
Skellige Old Woman 02|I'm sorry. Skja--
Skellige Priestess 02|Craven.
Skellige Old Woman 02|My apologies. Craven. Craven could've told you more.
Geralt|They say the Wild Hunt destroyed this village…
Skellige Priestess 02|That is true… Though few believe us. You don't either, I'm sure.
Yennefer|Did you see riders on skeletal horses? Wearing frost-covered armor?
Skellige Woman 05|Aye… That's how it was… They landed on our shores in a ship made of the claws of dead men… Like in the ballads.
Skellige Woman 05|Leif yelled to grab the children… Then they came… Cut him 'cross his face. He tried to whisper… Only blood came out…
Skellige Priestess 01|You were to ask about someone, not prod their wounds. That's enough.
Yennefer|What happened then?
Geralt|Go on.
Skellige Woman 05|I ran out… To get help, to get Leif… But… So many bodies. Jole, Ingvar… Little Nekki…
Yennefer|Which way did the riders go?
Skellige Woman 05|Towards the sea… Through the ravine… on horses made of bones… bones and ice… and…
Skellige Priestess 01|Enough.
Skellige Priestess 01|Get to the point. Now.
Geralt|Yen… Leave her alone.
Yennefer|You don't understand. If we can learn where--
Geralt|I understand. And I'm still asking you to stop.
Yennefer|You're right.
Geralt|So, it's a complex curse… Meaning I need more information.
Skellige Priestess 02|I understand… But I've told you all I know.
Skellige Priestess 01|Speak with Toradar's son, Einar. He was in the garden when Morkvarg and his men attacked. He saw what happened. Of all the pilgrims there at the time, he alone escaped with his life.
Skellige Priestess 01|He settled in Larvik. You'll find him there at the landing, provided he's not out to sea when you arrive.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Greetings. Can we ask you something?
Skellige Woman 05|…
Geralt|Excuse me… Can we ask you…
Skellige Woman 05|You can.
Geralt|We're looking for a young woman. Ashen hair, green eyes. Seen her?
Skellige Woman 05|No.
Yennefer|Try to remember. This is important to us.
Skellige Woman 05|Ain't to me.
Skellige Woman 05|Ain't nothin' important to me. They destroyed it. They destroyed it all.
Geralt|Were you here when the Hunt attacked the village?
Skellige Woman 05|Why do you care?
Yennefer|We're following their trail. Anything you can…
Skellige Woman 05|Hahaahaa!
Skellige Woman 05|Hear that, Gimri? And they say I've gone mad…
Geralt|Farewell.
Skellige Woman 05|Mhm.
Skellige Woman 05|Leave me be.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Greetings… Can we talk?
Skellige Old Man 04|I fought as much as anyone.
Yennefer|What was that?
Skellige Old Man 04|Said I, Soren the Elder, fought as much as the rest. Only survived 'cause the blow missed me organs.
Geralt|We're looking for a young woman. Ashen hair, green eyes… Was she here?
Skellige Old Man 04|Our lads would return from the Continent with captive wenches. I took no interest in 'em. At my age one woman under me roof is too much already.
Yennefer|No… Ciri'd never let herself be taken.
Skellige Old Man 04|Aww, you don't know our lads…
Yennefer|And you don't know Ciri.
Geralt|Little irritable, aren't you?
Skellige Old Man 04|Who wouldn't be? Folk come from around and about to gape, see what's happened. All look at me cock-eyed, too.
Skellige Old Man 04|"They didn't kill you?" "Buried three sons, but you're still alive?"
Skellige Old Man 04|I explain and explain, but I'm weary on it. Next raid, I sail with the Larvik lads, show 'em what I'm made of.
Yennefer|Aren't you a little old for a raid?
Skellige Old Man 04|Old? I'll never be too old to spill Nordling blood… or die an honorable death at their hands.
Geralt|Farewell.
Skellige Old Man 04|Freya watch over you.
Skellige Old Man 04|Well? What now?
Skellige Old Man 04|Tove, Kvit, Hanne… They'd barely sprouted whiskers, yet in the ground they lie… And me - livin' and unharmed.
Skellige Old Man 04|Ahh, perhaps 'twere written in the stars…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Worried this trail might've gone cold…
Yennefer|Even if Craven's dead… We'll manage.
Geralt|How, exactly?
Yennefer|You'll see when the time comes.
Geralt|You could stand to be nicer sometimes.
Yennefer|I suppose… but then I wouldn't be the woman you fell in love with, would I?
Yennefer|You didn't mention your heroic battle with this Morkvarg character…
Geralt|You know me… Don't like to take my work home…
Yennefer|Mhm. I'm afraid you don't like home - the very concept of it.
Yennefer|I asked you once to move to Vengerberg for me. Remember? Was that ever a row…
Geralt|Yeah… Those were the days…
Yennefer|Ivy-covered walls, a mysterious garden… Shame we're not here under different circumstances …
Yennefer|Thought you wanted to start at the tree?
Geralt|Let's do what we came for and leave. Can't say I like this place.
Yennefer|Fine… I'll wait near the tree.
Yennefer|So, where shall we start?
Geralt|Let's go to that tree the sisters mentioned.
Yennefer|Plan to bleed yourself for the goddess?
Geralt|Not necessarily. But Craven did… We just might pick up his scent.
Yennefer|My, my… That must be Morkvarg… Quite the appetite.
Geralt|Mhm. Might even call it wolven…
Yennefer|He doesn't seem happy to see us.
Geralt|Wait till he gets a closer look at me.
Yennefer|Hey, Geralt! Come back!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Craven was here. Look… the impression - kneeled down on one knee… And cut himself to make the offering. Bloodstains… see them?
Yennefer|No… I may be inhumanly beautiful, but I don't have superhuman senses. Not like you.
Geralt|Which is why you should stay up here.
Geralt|No offense, but in that undergrowth and mud, you'd be like a…
Yennefer|Ball and chain?
Geralt|Planned to say it gentler, but yeah, that's basically what I had in mind.
Yennefer|Fine… We'll do as you say. If the need arises, I can cast spells from up here.
Geralt|Fine… See you later then.
Yennefer|Don't get hurt. Remember, I need you if I'm to find Ciri.
Yennefer|Oh, come on, I was just teasing. Fool. I need you - period. Better?
Geralt|Mhm. Better.
Geralt|Thought you might object…
Yennefer|Me? Please. I can be extraordinarily conciliatory.
Geralt|Yen, look me in the eye… What're you plotting?
Yennefer|Many things… How to seize the Temerian crown, how to sell Kaer Morhen out from under you. Go, already.
Geralt|You can't help me track him… So I don't see any reason for you to go down there.
Yennefer|You're right… Besides, trudging through mud in these heels would be murder.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|The flood gate's open… but nothing's happening.
Geralt|Craven's blood…
Geralt|Light prints… Craven trod carefully.
Geralt|Craven was injured. Started running.
Geralt|Craven hid here… then struck.
Geralt|The prints crisscross… Morkvarg followed Craven from the start.
Geralt|Looks like Morkvarg got bored of sneaking around… And attacked.
Geralt|Deep, spaced-out prints… Morkvarg started running after Craven.
Geralt|Claw marks… Craven slammed the door in Morkvarg's face.
Geralt|Sanctuary of some kind…
Geralt|Door won't budge… Craven must've blocked it… or it's just locked… Gotta go around.
Geralt|Fighting was the last thing on Craven's mind by this point… Ran as fast as he could.
Geralt|Two deep prints, then nothing. Morkvarg must've jumped.
Geralt|Lots of blood… and it's not human. Craven managed to wound Morkvarg.
Geralt|These prints should lead me to Craven… or his body.
Geralt|Morkvarg was on his trail again here.
Geralt|No sign of Craven, and no way out… Except the well…
Geralt|Craven's blood…
Geralt|Morkvarg's blood.
Geralt|Something down there. Can't see a thing.
Geralt|Morkvarg was wounded… Didn't give up, though.
Geralt|Morkvarg doesn't give up easily…
Geralt|One of Freya's priestesses. No signs of violence. Must've died of hunger… a while ago.
Geralt|A key - could come in handy.
Geralt|Must've hid here when Morkvarg raided the garden.
Geralt|Waited a long time for death to come.
Geralt|Prints lead to the well. Guess Craven didn't wanna be eaten, preferred to drown.
Geralt|I can't climb that. Need to find another way.
Geralt|Typical fisherman's boat… smashed on the rocks.
Geralt|Hoof prints…
Geralt|Lots of prints… old and new. His lair must be nearby.
Geralt|Found Craven… Now to look for the key. Won't get out of here without it.
Geralt|Craven's blood. Flowing profusely… Trail's clear. Should lead me to him.
Geralt|Gotta get to the other side. The low road, maybe? If I can open the sluice…
Geralt|Blood - human.
Geralt|Footprintslk, light ones - someone was being stealthy.
Geralt|Prints… deep, spaced far apart. A runner.
Geralt|Blood, ground's all dug up… Site of a fight, no doubt.
Geralt|Deep prints, blood… Just trying to get away.
Geralt|Footprints and pawprints crisscross. Man and beast…
Geralt|Fight happened here.
Geralt|Monster tracks… Running, chasing something.
Geralt|Claws… Really wanted to get inside. Desperate, almost.
Geralt|Monster's blood.
Geralt|Footprints. Lead to the well… And end there.
Geralt|Claw marks… Huge claws.
Geralt|Man, under twenty, multiple wounds. Found shelter here… and bled to death.
Geralt|Human blood. Lots of it. Deep wound, must've been.
<|endoftext|>
Yennefer|Did you find something?
Geralt|A trail…. leads right to a locked door!
Yennefer|I think you can get around it!
Geralt|Another corpse… no bite marks here either…
Geralt|No bite marks… Morkvarg doesn't eat his victims. Strange.
Yennefer|Is it Craven?!
Geralt|No, this one's been here a while!
Yennefer|What?! I can't hear you! If you want to chat, come closer!
Geralt|Her senses are really dulled…
Geralt|Roots… So I'm right under Yen. Hey! Can you hear me?
Yennefer|Geralt! You scared me!
Geralt|Sorry, didn't mean to.
Yennefer|I hope not! Let me know once you find Craven!
Yennefer|I'll wait here for you… Come right back, all right?
<|endoftext|>
Yennefer|Well? What is it?
Geralt|Whaddaya know about this garden?
Yennefer|Let me think… That it's dreadfully overgrown.
Geralt|Had its history in mind.
Yennefer|They say Freya herself planted it. When the world was young the goddess strode across Skellige, sowing seeds among the rocks. But Uroboros, the snake, bit a hole in her basket.
Yennefer|All her seeds poured from it and landed here. Thus, this garden is bounteous, while the rest of Skellige is barren.
Geralt|You believe that?
Yennefer|Is that a serious question? Of course not. Favorable microclimate for plant life, end of story.
Geralt|To transform into a werewolf… It's a dog's life, eh?
Yennefer|Well, there's not a youth out there who doesn't have a wolf in his belly.
Geralt|Then the curse confined him to this garden? Couldn't really cut his wolf loose.
Yennefer|No question he was top dog here…
Geralt|Just wolfin' things down… or not.
Yennefer|Geralt… That's enough, hm?
Geralt|Fine. Still had a few good ones at the tip of my tongue.
Yennefer|I'm sure you did. We'll say you won.
Geralt|I found a corpse… not Craven's, though.
Yennefer|Aha. And you thought I'd find this interesting because…?
Geralt|Because… no bite marks on it… Doesn't seem strange to you?
Yennefer|Zerrikanian cuisine, Dandelion's fame and shoes with curly toes seem strange to me, yet I don't discuss them with you.
Geralt|Reading between the lines here - think I'm wasting your time?
Yennefer|I mean merely that we should focus on what's most important at the moment.
Yennefer|Why would it? I thought that's how the curse worked… Morkvarg is ever hungry, yet cannot eat.
Geralt|Yeah, but… what about the other wolves?
Geralt|Unless… they refused to touch the food before the leader of the pack did…
Yennefer|Well, now you've solved that fascinating riddle, perhaps you can return to looking for Craven? Hm?
Geralt|All right. Going back down.
Yennefer|Be careful.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Damn… Dead… has been for a while.
Geralt|Yen! Found him!
Yennefer|And?
Geralt|And I've seen rotfiends in better condition than this.
Yennefer|Shit…
Yennefer|Fine, scrape together what you can and haul the bits up here!
Geralt|Yen… there's no point…
Yennefer|There's no point in discussing this through a grate!
Yennefer|We'll talk when you get here, all right?
Geralt|That's Yen… Charming as ever.
Geralt|C'mon. Someone wants to meet you.
Geralt|Take it you've got a plan?
Yennefer|No, I just like to stare at rotting flesh!
Geralt|All right… But I don't know how to get out!
Yennefer|You'll think of something!
Geralt|All right… got the key!
Yennefer|Let's meet up top! Move it!
<|endoftext|>
Yennefer|Putrefaction's set in… but the vocal cords are intact. We might still get something out of him…
Geralt|Doesn't look like the talkative type.
Yennefer|Anyone can be made to talk, even a corpse… One must simply know how.
Geralt|Thought necromancy was strictly forbidden.
Yennefer|So is premarital sex. But I'm not about to be bothered by such foolishness.
Geralt|Need any ingredients for the spell?
Yennefer|Mhm. The blood of a newborn, a virgin's tongue and the eye of a newt.
Geralt|Mind trying again, without the sarcasm?
Yennefer|I don't need a thing. I'm a sorceress, not a village herbalist.
Yennefer|All I need is energy… a great deal of energy. We're very lucky this place is saturated with magic.
Geralt|It's also considered sacred. Priestesses'll be furious if you use the garden's Power to revive a corpse.
Yennefer|All the more reason to get it over with before they realize what's happening.
Geralt|Let's get to work.
Yennefer|Celain, celain, deffraen!
Yennefer|Celain, celain, davedar!
Skellige Warrior 03|Aaaaaaach!
Yennefer|Are you Craven of Lofoten?!
Skellige Warrior 03|Nnn… Nnoooo… Iiiii….. Haaaavvvvve… a naaaammmme…. Sssssskjalll! Skjalllll! Iiiiii aaaaammmm Skjaaaallll!
Geralt|We're looking for Ciri. Ashen hair, green eyes… Have you seen her?
Skellige Warrior 03|Ssssshhhhheee… ssshhheeee's wwwwhyyy thhhhhheeeyy currrsssssed meeeeee….
Yennefer|I don't care about that! What happened to her? What was she doing here? Speak!
Skellige Warrior 03|Nnnnnoooo…..
Yennefer|Speak!
Skellige Warrior 03|Aaaaaacch!
Yennefer|Speak!
Skellige Warrior 03|Thhhe ssssseeeeeeaaa… Sssshhhheee fffeeelll…. Alllmmmoost drrrrroooowned…
Geralt|You died in battle. You've recovered--
Yennefer|Geralt, this is not the time to cheer up a corpse.
Yennefer|A young woman, ashen hair, green eyes. What happened to her?
Geralt|We are about to make some enemies…
Yennefer|I don't need everyone to like me. I most value the opinions of those I care about. You, for example.
Yennefer|So… can we start?
Geralt|Mhm.
Yennefer|Geralt, you're getting on my nerves. I offer you solutions, you try to poke holes in them.
Geralt|Sorry to bother you with my doubts.
Yennefer|Please, Geralt…
Geralt|That's just it - your 'please' is never a request, only ever a command. But let's move on.
Geralt|I'm not poking holes, just thinking about the consequences. How about you? Given them any thought?
Yennefer|No.
Yennefer|Geralt, I'll say it again… We're short on time. Ciri is short on time.
Geralt|Mhm.
Yennefer|Fine, you busy yourself pouting. I'll handle the rest.
Geralt|Black magic's no joke. Casting those spells never ends well. Never.
Yennefer|I don't like it any more than you do, believe me. But the thought that Ciri is in danger? I like that even less.
Geralt|I understand. Still doesn't give us the right to--
Yennefer|Geralt, please. This is not the time to debate ethics.
<|endoftext|>
Cirilla|And where is he? My… friend?
Skellige Warrior 03|Stepped out a while ago. Said he needed to find a boat.
Skellige Warrior 03|Why's he wear that mask? Somethin' not right with his mug?
Cirilla|No. He simply doesn't like others to see it.
Cirilla choice|Help me up.
Cirilla|Help… help me stand.
Skellige Warrior 03|I don't… I don't think you should--
Cirilla|Less talk, more giving me a hand.
Skellige Woman 04|Ah, that's me brother for you. Outta sight for a second, and he's already put his paws on a girl.
Skellige Warrior 03|Dah. Astrid, you're as dim as dishwater! You know perfectly well I'm helpin' her up.
Skellige Woman 04|It's a shame, I know, but I've got to interrupt your courtship. Come, we're off to the sauna.
Cirilla|Where?
Skellige Woman 04|Why's your mouth agape like you're noodlin' for an eel? The sauna!
Skellige Woman 04|Girl… You was blue as a whale when we brought you in here! Your blood needs thawin'!
Cirilla choice|I must get to Drowned Dead Rock.
Cirilla|I'm sorry, but I must get to Drowned Dead Rock… as fast as possible.
Skellige Warrior 03|Shan't force you to stay… But the Rock's a ways off, and you can barely walk. You best take a horse.
Skellige Woman 04|True! Skjall can prepare a horse for you. You'll have to wait a spell, but even so you'll get there faster than on foot.
Cirilla|Fine… That will do. Thank you both very much.
Skellige Woman 04|Pish-posh, there's no need… Now come, we gotta sweat the sick outta you!
Cirilla|Where are my clothes?
Skellige Woman 04|I've taken 'em already. Come on!
Cirilla choice|I feel fine now.
Cirilla|Really, there's no need… I feel fine now.
Cirilla|Hey!
Skellige Woman 04|Fine? You can't stand on your own two feet…
Skellige Woman 04|And it's no surprise with your muscles frozen stiff. But don't you worry… Mum and I will take care of you.
Cirilla choice|Was I out long?
Cirilla|How long did I lie there?
Skellige Warrior 03|All day, nearabouts - 'twas morn when we brought you in, night's near come now.
Cirilla|Damn… Too long…
Skellige Warrior 03|You needed the rest, desperately.
Skellige Warrior 03|Been through a lot, eh? Got some nasty fresh-lookin' scars…
Cirilla choice|What? You undressed me?!
Cirilla|What's this?! Did you undress me?!
Skellige Warrior 03|I-- I'd no choice! Soaked through, you were, and I had to see if you'd any wounds that needed tendin'.
Cirilla|Mhm. And if my breasts needed smearing with fox tallow…
Skellige Warrior 03|Nay, nay--! Th-that was mum and sis! I-- I'd never dare. I swear. On my honor.
Cirilla|Easy. I believe you.
Cirilla choice|Yeah, a whole lot.
Cirilla|Yes… I've been through a lot.
Skellige Warrior 03|I never thought women on the Continent did any fightin'.
Cirilla|Sometimes they have no choice.
Cirilla choice|Where is my companion?
Skellige Warrior 03|You're awake… And I thought you'd…
Cirilla|Where am I? And who are you?
Skellige Warrior 03|It's all right. You're on Hindarsfjall, village of Lofoten. They call me Skjall.
Cirilla|But how'd I… What?
Skellige Warrior 03|We fished you out of the sea… Me and that friend of yours.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Woman 04|He's head over heels for you, girl. Sat at your bedside all the day, starin' like you was painted by a master!
Skellige Woman 02|Astrid! I asked you not to tell her!
Skellige Woman 04|Oops… Well, now the milk's spilt… do you fancy Skjall?
Cirilla choice|He's not half bad.
Cirilla|I must say, he's rather handsome…
Skellige Woman 04|Half the village sighs when he passes, but he likes you. A mysterious beauty, arose outta the sea foam…
Skellige Woman 02|Give it a rest. You're intolerable today!
Cirilla|Listen… It's lovely sitting here with you, but… I really must go now.
Skellige Woman 04|I understand. Who'd want to stay in this hole? We're all related three times over and the air stinks of fish.
Skellige Woman 02|I can't see how you're related to anyone here. No one in Lofoten groans and bitches quite like you do! Sit down and be quiet.
Skellige Woman 02|Child… Skjall's certain to have readied the horses by now, but before you go, you ought to take a quick jump in the water. It'll do you good.
Cirilla choice|I really should go.
Cirilla|I'm sorry… but I really must go.
Cirilla|Thank you once more.
Skellige Woman 02|And, once more, there's no need. Gods bless your journey!
Cirilla choice|Well… why not.
Cirilla|I suppose… why not?
Skellige Woman 02|Head through the door and you'll see the pier. Be careful, it's slippery.
Cirilla choice|Seems nice.
Cirilla|Well… he seems nice.
Skellige Woman 04|Oh, my… He's that bad?
Skellige Woman 02|Leave it, Astrid. Who she likes is her affair, and it's naught to you.
Cirilla choice|To tell the truth, I prefer women.
Cirilla|To be honest… I prefer women.
Skellige Woman 02|Aye, now I see. The skald sings true. Love bears many guises.
Cirilla|I'm here looking for someone.
Skellige Woman 04|Not your betrothed, I hope…
Cirilla|Why?
Skellige Woman 04|It'd break Skjall's heart…
Cirilla|Yes, my ship… We set sail from Novigrad.
Skellige Woman 02|And what brings you to Skellige?
Cirilla choice|Yes… of course.
Cirilla choice|No, I wasn't in a shipwreck.
Cirilla|No, that's not right… I wasn't in a shipwreck.
Skellige Woman 02|Hmm. So what brings you to our shores?
Cirilla|You know… I don't really have a home. I'm a traveler.
Skellige Woman 02|Ah, that's right… Where was your ship headed?
Cirilla|Ship?
Skellige Woman 02|We fished you outta the sea. We thought you were in a shipwreck.
Cirilla choice|I have no home.
Cirilla choice|I'd rather not talk about myself.
Cirilla|I'd rather… not talk about myself.
Skellige Woman 04|Why's that?
Cirilla|Someone might come looking for me. I wouldn't want to cause you any trouble.
Skellige Woman 04|It's too late for Skjall…
Cirilla|What?
Skellige Woman 02|Here we are, gabbin' away. Steam's gone… gotta douse the coals.
Skellige Woman 04|Say… back home… have you got saunas, too?
Skellige Woman 02|Finally! I was so worried she'd--
Skellige Woman 04|Ach, Mum, you always worry. Everything's fine. Ain't it?
Cirilla|Mhm. Yes. It's fine.
Skellige Woman 02|Good, that's good…
Skellige Woman 02|What's on your thigh, child? That a bruise?
Cirilla|This? No… it's a tattoo.
Skellige Woman 04|So it is… A red rose… It mean anythin'?
Cirilla choice|I got it for someone special who's dead now.
Cirilla|It's a souvenir... of someone special who's dead now.
Skellige Woman 04|I picture it already… You were promised to a handsome lad… He gave you a red rose before sailin' off, but the cruel sea swallowed him…
Cirilla|Close.
Skellige Woman 02|Eeh, child… Those bards've stuffed your head with their foolish romances…
Cirilla choice|No. I was young and drunk.
Cirilla|No, it means that I was young and drunk… And it happened. At least it's not terribly visible.
Skellige Woman 04|I like it. Wouldn't mind one myself… here, right above me rear…
Skellige Woman 02|Ach, you need a man, girl. Get more foolish every spring…
Skellige Woman 02|But why've you got the towel, child? It'll just get wet…
Skellige Woman 04|Mum… she's from the Continent… she's shy.
Cirilla choice|I'm not shy, not at all.
Cirilla|I'm not at all shy. I just wanted something to sit on…
Skellige Woman 04|Mhm. Expect me to believe that?
Skellige Woman 02|Astrid! Behave yourself or I'll send you to gut fish with your pa!
Cirilla choice|I'm still cold.
Cirilla|I was worried about drafts… A lung infection's the last thing I need right now…
Skellige Woman 02|See, Astrid. Girls your age can be sensible after all.
Skellige Woman 04|Sensible girls aren't tossed on shore by the waves.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Old Woman 02|Aaaaargh!
Skellige Woman 05|Run for your lives!
Skellige Warrior 03|You stay here! I'll go and--!
Cirilla|I can look after myself.
Skellige Warrior 03|Oh… You're here… The horses are ready.
Cirilla|As am I. Shall we ride?
Skellige Warrior 03|Listen, I… I hope… My sister, she didn't talk any nonsense to you, did she?
Cirilla choice|No, just said you like me.
Cirilla|No… Except to mention that you fancy me.
Skellige Warrior 03|Wha? But I asked her… Besides, it's not… O' course, y'are very… But…
Skellige Warrior 03|But-- Y'know what? Let's ride. You're in a hurry, and it'll be dark soon.
Cirilla choice|I'm not in that much of a hurry.
Cirilla|I'm not in that much of a hurry…
Cirilla|Your first kiss, wasn't it?
Skellige Warrior 03|O'course it weren't.
Skellige Warrior 03|Argh… Aye. Me first.
Cirilla|We don't have much time… But it's enough for you to learn a few things…
Cirilla choice|You're right. Let's go.
Cirilla|You're right. I hope to come back here one day… We can finish our conversation then.
Skellige Warrior 03|Sounds dangerous…
Cirilla|I didn't intend it to…
Skellige Warrior 03|I'll take Njord, you can ride Grayback. She's old, but she'll make the--
Cirilla choice|I'm sorry… But I really don't have time right now.
Cirilla|I'm sorry, but I can't bring myself to chat right now.
Skellige Warrior 03|Right. Besides… it's not important.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Warrior 05|Not like that. Keep your elbow up, or your arrow'll go astray.
Skellige Warrior 04|I know… But me arm hurts.
Skellige Warrior 05|Good. Means your muscles are workin'.
Skellige Warrior 05|And mind the string don't catch on your nose.
Skellige Warrior 04|Pa… I know!
Skellige Warrior 05|Storm's a-comin'. Gotta go to your mum, tell her to take the wash down… You keep practicin'.
Skellige Warrior 04|Aye.
Skellige Warrior 05|If your fingers tire, grip the string with…
Skellige Warrior 04|No need. They won't tire.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Warrior 03|What… What was that?!
Cirilla|The Wild Hunt.
Skellige Warrior 03|Ragh nar Roog… The world's end…
Cirilla|No… Not yet… But I must go. They're here for me.
Skellige Warrior 03|Get on the horse. I'll show you the way to the Rock.
Cirilla choice|Thanks, Skjall.
Cirilla|I don't know how to thank you…
Skellige Warrior 03|You can thank me once we get there safe… Let's ride!
Cirilla choice|What about your family?
Cirilla|You should stay, see to Astrid, your mum…
Skellige Warrior 03|Afterwards… Once I'm sure you'll make it. Let's go!
<|endoftext|>
Yennefer|What became of that creature? Where is he?!
Skellige Warrior 03|Sssss-tooo-pp…. Hhh-urrrr-tsssss…
Yennefer|What?!
Skellige Warrior 03|Ssss-aawwwww hhhh-iii-mmm… aaaa-tt…. Dddd-ooo-nn-aarrrr-sss… Bbb-uttt… hhh-eee… sss-ooo-lllddd… hhh-iii-mmm…
Yennefer|To whom?!
Skellige Warrior 03|Ddd-ooo-nnn't… Knnnn-oowwww…
Yennefer|Begone.
Skellige Warrior 03|Ttt-eelll… thhhh-emmm… Ccc-llleeearrrr… mmm-yyy… nnn-aaa….
Yennefer|Begone I say!
Skellige Warrior 03|Aaaaaaach!
Geralt|Yen… let's get out of here. Now.
Yennefer|You needn't ask me twice.
Skellige Priestess 02|The garden… Our garden!
Skellige Priestess 02|How could you…? We helped… and you-- Inconceivable.
Yennefer|Now, now…
Skellige Priestess 01|Don't you dare try to calm me. We've every right to be furious. Furious! And you… You will pay for this.
Geralt|We had no choice. We'd never have learned what happened to our--
Skellige Priestess 01|Do you really think you're justified?! That your hunt for a foreign woman gives you the right to destroy our garden?
Yennefer|I'm sure it doesn't in your eyes.
Skellige Priestess 01|I shall make sure all Skellige hears what you did here.
Yennefer|Wait… I did this. I alone. Geralt tried to stop me… I refused to listen.
Skellige Priestess 01|I might have known. They warned me about you…
Skellige Priestess 02|Sorceresses…
Skellige Priestess 01|None shall open their door to you, none shall feed your hunger, and none shall tend to your wounds.
Geralt|I'm sorry.
Skellige Priestess 01|Is that all? Will you say nothing else?
Geralt|Nothing that would help.
Geralt|What… what happened to the garden?
Yennefer|It died. Like I said… The spell, it requires a great deal of energy.
Geralt|You knew it would end like this, didn't you? Didn't consider it worth mentioning?
Yennefer|No - I knew you'd protest. Your sense of decency is charming, but it does get in the way sometimes.
Yennefer|Geralt, I know we should talk… But not here, all right? I don't wish to stay a moment longer.
Geralt|Yen… are you all right?
Yennefer|I'm fine now. The spell…
Yennefer|Imagine putting wriggling cockroaches in your mouth… Or swimming in manure. That's more or less how it felt.
Yennefer|I'm splendid. I'd feel even better if I hadn't had to remind you to ask that question.
Geralt|Could've shown some sympathy for the boy. He--
Yennefer|That was no boy, Geralt. It was a hunk of rotting, rancid flesh that spoke through my magic.
Geralt|Didn't just speak. It howled in pain.
Yennefer|I know it seemed real… But it was no longer human. Do you understand?
Yennefer|Nice of you to be so concerned for the corpse. Much more than you were for me.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Yen… you didn't have to do that.
Yennefer|But I wanted to.
Yennefer|I'd rather not talk about it. We must focus on what Skjall told us.
Geralt|Ciri's trail in Skellige - we've followed it, exhausted the possibilities… Might be time to go back to the Continent.
Yennefer|Before you do, there's one thing… It's important.
Geralt|What's that?
Yennefer|Let's meet in Larvik, at the warriors' hall. We'll speak there.
Geralt|Fine. Larvik. See you there soon.
Yennefer|Thank you. For that… and for your help in the garden. I'd not have managed without you.
Geralt|It was nothing.
Yennefer|Geralt, you know me. I'm rare to praise, but when I do, it is sincere.
Geralt|Can we do this later…? Sorry, need to take care of something.
Yennefer|Well, if you must, you must. I shall wait for you in Larvik for a time. If you don't make it, we’ll meet in Vizima.
Yennefer|I must search the palace library. Perhaps I'll find something about this ugly creature Skjall saw, something to tell us who… or what it is.
Geralt|See you, Yen. Take care of yourself.
Yennefer|Wait.
Yennefer|This matter in Larvik - it really is important to me. I'd appreciate it if you didn't tarry.
Yennefer|After all, we do owe the emperor a report.
Geralt|Ciri's our concern. Ours alone.
Yennefer|Perhaps. But that is not what we agreed with Emhyr. We must see him.
Geralt|If we gotta, we gotta. So be it.
Yennefer|We'd never have known Ciri had returned if not for Emhyr and his agents. We owe him this.
Geralt|I refuse. Don't have the slightest intention of reporting to him.
Yennefer|Fine… I can't force you.
Geralt|Being awfully loyal to your patron.
Yennefer|He's your patron as well, dear. Don't forget that lest he remind you of it himself.
Geralt|You were gonna ask me something. What was it?
Yennefer|Tell me…
Geralt|But I'll lose it if I try to deal with that possibility now. We have to do what we can… See what happens.
Geralt|Didn't learn much. Though… though we can be sure Ciri's not in Skellige anymore.
Geralt|Maybe she's in Velen, hiding somewhere. Or in Novigrad - world's largest city…
Yennefer|Better to have some idea where to look than none.
Geralt|Ugh. Makes me wonder what she's gotten herself into.
Yennefer|Can't even begin to imagine. But we will pull her out of it, safe and sound. That I promise you.
Geralt|She disappeared from Novigrad, too. Checked that… Maybe she's in Velen, hiding somewhere.
Geralt|Not in Velen either… Leaves Novigrad - world's biggest city.
Yennefer|No one said it would be easy.
Geralt|Not in Velen or Novigrad, either… She's disappeared. Again.
Yennefer|Perhaps we should reexamine what we've learned. We might've missed a clue that would push us forward…
Geralt|Certainly hope that's the case.
Geralt|Key to finding Ciri is that ugly… thing Skjall saw on the beach. That's what I think.
Yennefer|You must see Donar, ask him to whom exactly he sold the… thing.
Geralt|Not coming with me?
Yennefer|You know… I'm better off not showing myself to him now.
Geralt|You know… I saw something… or someone who looked just like that.
Yennefer|Where?
Geralt|In Velen… Local ruler, a baron, keeps him at his castle. Told me he won him in a card game in Novigrad.
Yennefer|You must go and get the creature. I don't know - buy him, kidnap him…
Geralt|Won't be necessary. Baron owes me a favor. A big one.
Geralt|Seems early to me. What would I do with him? Cart him around while I searched for Ciri and hunted monsters?
Geralt|He's safe where he is, with the baron - least I think so. I'll get him once I know why Ciri went to Novigrad, what she did there… Still a chance I might find her there.
Yennefer|All right… I'll keep my fingers crossed.
Yennefer|Now tell me - do you…? No, never mind.
Geralt|The thing's clearly cursed - its mind is a jumble… Can't have anything resembling a normal conversation with it.
Yennefer|Grumbling won't get us anywhere. All will be well. A curse? Please. Nothing a sorceress and a witcher couldn't handle.
Geralt|In Velen. At a castle until recently ruled by a self-proclaimed baron. Now controlled by his right hand man, Sergeant Ardal.
Geralt|It's time to go. Leave Skellige. At least for now…
Yennefer|Do you think… Is there a chance that thing might be Ciri? That… well… she's been transformed by some curse?
Geralt|Don't even want to think about it.
Yennefer|Geralt… We must.
Geralt|Might be… From what I know she was looking to cure a powerful curse while in Novigrad.
Geralt|Might be her… Might be her companion, or someone else altogether, connected to them both… I don't know.
Geralt|I'll go see Donar… Then I'll leave Skellige.
Geralt|Gonna miss you.
Yennefer|Geralt, don't… There's nothing more pathetic than a sorceress in tears.
Geralt|Not appropriate for a sorceress to show emotion?
Yennefer|No more than it is for a witcher.
Geralt|No one's watching.
Yennefer|I shall go as well… I fear I won't be welcome here after our talk with Skjall.
Geralt|Where will you go?
Yennefer|To Vizima. I've not yet repaid Emhyr all I owe him…
Geralt|Where'll we meet once I get Uma from the baron?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Apparently, there was an ugly creature here. Showed up the day after Lofoten was destroyed.
Donar An Hindar|Ah! True! Crawled up from the beach. Gob looked like eels had been nibbling it. And he walked like he had a barrel between his legs. A good deal of fun, that one.
Geralt|You sold him? Did I hear right?
Donar An Hindar|Aye, I sold 'im. This merchant comes here from time to time. Buys narwhal horns off us. Uses them to make earrings and other such baubles for the wenches.
Geralt|We were talking about the creature.
Donar An Hindar|Ah, yes. This merchant - his eyes lit up soon as he saw the beast. Said a freak like that'd be the pride of any court. Proud of that - you imagine? Foreigners! I didn't wanna sell 'im. But he offered a slew of coin.
Geralt|Where will I find this merchant? And the creature?
Donar An Hindar|Why d'you ask? Wanna buy him for yourself?
Geralt|Mhm. Looking to train a new witcher.
Donar An Hindar|Hah! Good one. The merchant… He asked about the route to Novigrad, if there was pirates. So I reckon that's where he sailed.
Geralt|Just as likely that he stayed there as it is that he moved on. Either way, my chances of finding him are slim.
Geralt|Well, thanks anyway. Take care.
Geralt|Didn't know there was a slave trade in Skellige…
Donar An Hindar|This weren't no human, Geralt. If you'd seen him - if you'd seen the mad things he does…
Geralt|Tell me. What's he do?
Donar An Hindar|Deh, raa… Long bloody story. Suffice to say my hound's wiser than he was… And my hound eats his own shite sometimes.
<|endoftext|>
Cerys|I've as much right to it as you do!
Hjalmar|And I'd expect you to support me, not pinch my allies! If an an Craite's to wear the crown, it--
Cerys|Should be you? 'Cause you got fur growin' on your chin, that it?
Hjalmar|Show some of your own, and the jarls just might listen to you!
Cerys|Want your mug smacked? Remember! I was left standin' last time we crossed fists.
Hjalmar|Yeah? So you'll fight the Vildkaarls with me? Wonder who'll do better… You… or Hjalmar the Giant Slayer!
Cerys|Ugh! Stop your shite boastin'!
Hjalmar|Cerys! Hey! Ah, dammit!
Geralt|Don't see Crach. He talking to the jarls?
Arnvald|No, went to his chambers. To prepare your promised reward, no doubt.
Hjalmar|If you've a spell, witcher, perhaps you'd fancy some fisticuffs with the Vildkaarls? Loosen up your joints after your journey?
Geralt|Maybe later.
Geralt|Bad way to play it out.
Hjalmar|Think I don't know that? But you saw her, she's so… so…
Arnvald|Stubborn? Fierce? Mule-headed? Refuses to listen to anyone?
Hjalmar|Exactly!
Arnvald|Ahem…
Hjalmar|Hahaha! True, Arnvald, me and Cerys - we're near twins in that regard.
<|endoftext|>
Bard Drogodar|Hey, listen here, listen well!
Bard Drogodar|And I shall ye tell, how Cerys an Craite tricked a demon most evil!
Bard Drogodar|The specter cold and cruel, a hym was called. For years on end, he held in thrall Jarl Udalryk, who could not eat nor sleep.
Bard Drogodar|Till one day Cerys, a brave lass of Skellige, called the demon out, challenged him to a duel.
Bard Drogodar|She went down to the land of Mörhogg, in whose dark corners demons dwell.
Bard Drogodar|Fearing neither wounds nor death, she called the hym from its lair.
Bard Drogodar|The fiend squirmed and hissed, then sprung at Cerys to grab her, kill her.
Bard Drogodar|But the brave lass was quicker, more clever by half. She stepped aside and with her sword ended his pitiful life.
Bard Drogodar|Listen here, listen well. I was there, I was there, and what I saw I now ye tell.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Cerys.
Cerys|Heard us, didn't you.
Geralt|So did everyone in that room who's not completely deaf.
Cerys|Hjalmar wastes his time arguin' with me, and I really don't know why… Everyone says I've no chance against him when it comes to the crown.
Geralt|You're his sister. It's natural.
Cerys|We've always argued, but I thought somethin' like this… Thought he'd show some respect. But he's just attackin' me.
Geralt|Would you prefer he ignored you, refused to see you as a rival?
Cerys|Perhaps you're right.
Geralt|Better get back to your guests. Won't gain any votes talking to me.
Cerys|You're right… Till later, Geralt.
Geralt|You think you stand a chance?
Cerys|I don't know. That doesn't mean I'm givin' up. I'd never do that.
Geralt|Course you wouldn't.
Cerys|It's just, after Udalryk, solving his grief, I thought I'd gained some respect. Thought they were takin' me serious.
Cerys|But no. Every step of the way I have to prove I'm fit to be queen.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Berserker 01|Look… He's back.
Skellige Berserker 02|Wanna lose some more teeth?
Geralt|Let's do this.
Skellige Berserker 01|Gladly.
Geralt|Not in the mood to fight.
Skellige Berserker 03|That time o' the month, eh? Get outta here, ye grayin' cunt.
Skellige Berserker 02|Got lucky once, mutant… But now I'm gonna club you like a seal pup.
Geralt|Heard you're taking on challengers in fistfights.
Skellige Berserker 02|Challengers? Argh, nay. Ain't none a challenge to us.
Skellige Berserker 03|We're here to hit. Hit till our fists're red with blood.
Skellige Berserker 03|Fight or get outta my sight, foreigner.
Geralt|Hjalmar? Can you…?
Hjalmar|Ugh, seal shit.
Hjalmar|Take a look. Still got all my teeth?
Geralt|Most of 'em. Did quite a number on you.
Hjalmar|Why're you laughin'? They'd 'ave trashed you, too.
Geralt|Huh, doubt it.
Hjalmar|That so? Care to wager on it? Drop any one of the Vildkaarls, and I'll give you my sword. End up like me… you part with yours.
Geralt|You're on. Start wrapping that sword for me.
Hjalmar|Don't sell your fish till they're in the boat, Wolf.
Geralt|Vildkaarls? Who're they?
Hjalmar|Ehh, these wild men, live in the hills.
Geralt|Shepherds, then?
Hjalmar|Aye. Without the sheep. They live off killin', eat only what they hunt, and they fight like no one else!
Geralt|Thanks. Got scars enough.
Hjalmar|See your bollocks've shriveled.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Greetings, Birna. Feast not to your liking?
Lady Bran|This is no feast. It's a farmers' market where votes are bought and sold like sheepskins.
Geralt|Leaving Kaer Trolde?
Lady Bran|Tomorrow at daybreak.
Lady Bran|Enjoy yourself, Master Geralt.
Geralt|Svanrige's not gonna vie for support?
Lady Bran|Bran's son will not haggle for a crown that is his by right.
Geralt|Far as I know, crown goes to the claimant who gains the most votes.
Lady Bran|That is the tradition. But not all traditions are good. The Isles' care should be entrusted to a single family.
Geralt|What's wrong with voting for your king?
Lady Bran|Take a walk, listen, and you'll understand. The claimants already hand out land, promise privileges, titles, favorable judgments… They behave like whores lifting their skirts for every passer-by.
Lady Bran|A king by the grace of votes is no ruler, but a debtor. This must end. We must start by placing Bran's first-born son on the throne. I hope the jarls will see the wisdom of it.
Geralt|Take it you have a specific family in mind.
Lady Bran|Of course. Bran was the best king Skellige's seen in centuries. The throne should pass on to Svanrige, his true born son, and then on to his sons.
<|endoftext|>
Crach|Hear that? Dammit, Hjalmar's probably started another row.
Geralt|That's not Hjalmar. Let's go.
Geralt|Between you and me… Hjalmar's not too hot-headed to be king?
Crach|Depends on the kind of king you have in mind. Want one who'll send emissaries, move figurines about a map, calculate the most profitable option. Then yes, he's too hot-headed.
Crach|But Skellige wants a different ruler. The kind who'll drown Nilfgaard in blood, sooner jump into a fire than surrender. And that is Hjalmar.
Geralt|If you escalate your attacks, you stand to infuriate Emhyr. Could regret it someday.
Crach|In Skellige we spit on the notion of peace at any cost.
Geralt|Promised me a reward for helping your children.
Crach|And I aim to keep my word. Here. This bauble's been in the family for generations. I give it you for helping ensure the line endures.
Geralt|Beautiful craftsmanship. Thanks.
Crach|Heh, I'm the one--
Chorus Skellige|Lu-gos! Lu-gos! Lu-gos!
Geralt|Think the council of jarls will dare to put a woman on the throne?
Crach|If you'd asked me some months ago, I'd 'ave laughed in your face.
Crach|But today I see, and I'm not alone, that Cerys has something as rare in the Isles as a hot summer - patience.
Crach|Others act, then think. She's different. She thinks things through - the for, the against. But once she takes action, not a force in the world could stop her.
Geralt|May I?
Crach|You must, even! Come, I've been waiting for you.
Crach|So, feast to your liking? Any better than your Continental "balls"?
Geralt|Definitely more to drink.
Crach|Aye, there is. Rolled all of it out of my cellars! Double meads, triple, Cintrian plum brandy, Mahakaman spirit that burns the mouth like boiling water. Clan an Craite knows the meaning of hospitality!
Geralt|Something tells me there's a purpose to your hospitality.
Crach|Aye, there is. In the Isles, mead and meat stand to gain you as much support as feats accomplished blade in hand.
Geralt|If that's true, you can rest easy about how the vote'll turn out.
Crach|I'll rest easy on the morrow. When the crown rests on one of my children's heads.
Geralt|Feeling torn between Hjalmar and Cerys?
Crach|You mean, do I have a favorite? Nay. They're as different as fire and water. But an Craite blood flows in both.
Geralt|Saw you talking to Birna. What about?
Crach|Politics. After all, naught else interests her.
Crach|Wench tried to convince me that we must honor Bran's memory. And to that aim, I'm to command my offspring to withdraw from the race for the crown... support Svanrige, instead.
Geralt|Why do I think you turned her down?
Crach|You put it mildly. I showed her the door!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Dammit! Things've sure gotten messy.
Cerys|That's putting it mildly. We've clues to examine, things to consider. We must find out how this came to be, elsewise we--
Hjalmar|We've no time for that. I know where to find the guilty.
Cerys|Wait! Are you mad? You're gonna kill folk before we've learned what happened?
Hjalmar|Learn all you want. Meantime, I'll go wash the shame off our clan.
Cerys|Hey! The jarls aren't listenin' anymore! Stop playin' the hero and think for a second!
Hjalmar|Our honor's at stake, sis. That can't wait.
Cerys|Are you listening to me? Someone let those bears in. We must know who, and the answer lies somewhere in this room!
Geralt|You're right, Cerys. I'll help you.
Cerys|Thanks.
Hjalmar|Fine. See you when I return with the traitors' heads.
Geralt|I'm going with Hjalmar. Don't know where, but I'm going.
Hjalmar|Knew you'd not turn down an adventure!
Geralt|Pretty sure you can handle this fine without me.
Crach|Aye, we will. So long, Wolf.
Geralt|Anybody see how the bears got in?
Hjalmar|Don't matter. I know where to find the guilty already.
Holger Blackhand|Cloth! Gimme some cloth! Gotta stop the bleedin'! Quick!
Halbjorn|Da… Da…
Lugos The Mad|Take my cloak.
Holger Blackhand|Hold on, son, you'll pull through. A shark grabbed my leg once… Halbjorn?
Hjort|He's dead.
Holger Blackhand|Raaaaaaaaah!
Lugos The Mad|Crach! Where'd those bears come from?! Heh?! Answer! Now!
Hjalmar|Careful how you speak to my da!
Lugos The Mad|Stow your blade, pup. Or Crach'll lose a son, too!
Crach|You insult me, Lugos. And now you threaten my son. I will not stand for this.
Lugos The Mad|Then come here! C'mon! Put you down like a rabid dog!
Donar An Hindar|Calm down! Calm down! Enough blood's been spilt!
Donar An Hindar|Someone brought these beasts here to murder our sons and brothers. We cannot restore their lives.
Donar An Hindar|But we can, we must, avenge them. This burden falls upon the host - and his offspring.
Udalryk|Find the guilty, an Craite. Find and kill them. Else your clan will be cursed for a hundred generations to come.
Crach|I'll stay here. Someone must see to everything - summon the healer, hand the fallen over to their families.
Crach|Wolf… I thank you.
<|endoftext|>
Cerys|Ever see anythin' like that?
Geralt|No. And I hope I never will again.
Cerys|Where'd the bears come from? We were all laughin', eatin', drinkin'…
Cerys|Then suddenly - a massacre. Torrents of blood on the walls.
Geralt|Talking won't help anything.
Geralt|Let's look around.
Cerys|Lemme know what you find. I'll speak to the others. Maybe someone saw more than I did.
Geralt|We've talked enough.
Geralt|What happened before the massacre? Be precise.
Cerys|Yo-young Lugos bet he could empty a barrel of beer in one go. He climbed on a table, grabbed a pony keg of Cintrian wheat and started chuggin'.
Cerys|Err, his throat bulged like a blowfish, face went red… but he kept drinkin'. Folk started bangin' their tankards on the table, shoutin' "Lu-gos, Lu-gos!"
Cerys|Then, from the other side of the room, we heard this roar!
Cerys|We turned in unison as if a coxswain had called! They were there. They were already there! Folks closest to the bears didn't even manage to draw their weapons. They… they were ripped to shreds.
Geralt|We'll avenge them. I promise.
Geralt|Know who died?
Cerys|Drogodar, Draig Bon-Dhu, Blueboy Lugos, Halbjorn, Otrygg… Take some time mention them all.
Geralt|But you could name the claimants to the throne who survived in one breath - you, Hjalmar, and Svanrige.
Cerys|What're you sayin'?
Geralt|Nothing - just yet.
Cerys|I heard you helped Lugos - as you helped me with the hym.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|All right. What do we have here…?
Geralt|Bear's head, but the tongue's short, like a human's.
Geralt|Mouth smells of honey liqueur, mead… and something else… something… earthy.
Geralt|Bears like honey… before it's fermented. Strange.
Geralt|Something under the fur… a tattoo? Shape of a bear paw.
Geralt|Old scar… Looks like it was sutured.
Geralt|Half-man, half-bear. Something like a lycanthrope.
Geralt|No full moon, so something else caused the transformation. Maybe something he ate… or drank.
Geralt|Mead… Mead with an earthy aroma. Need to check the horns, tankards and bowls.
<|endoftext|>
Cerys|A guard saw what happened. Those weren't bears. They were--
Geralt|…men who transform into bears.
Cerys|Uh-huh. Berserkers.
Geralt|Think I know what caused them to transform - the mead they drank. Smell this.
Geralt|Mead spiked with blood… and something else. Thinking it could be a mushroom, but I don't recognize the type.
Cerys|Hjort might help us. Few druids know herbs better.
Geralt|Can't hurt to try.
Geralt|Berserkers?
Cerys|The skalds' name for warriors who change into animals in the midst of battle.
Cerys|The stuff of fairy tales, legends… But it seems to make sense, right?
Geralt|Mhm. Almost. We were at a feast, not on a battlefield.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Wanted to talk to you.
Holger Blackhand|What about?
Lugos The Mad|What about - what do you think, Holger?! He's not here about salted herring or the currents round Spikeroog!
Holger Blackhand|Flap your gob at me again, and I'll shut it for good.
Donar An Hindar|Calm down! You act like rabid dogs, not jarls of Skellige. Speak, witcher.
Geralt|Any ideas who might be behind the massacre?
Holger Blackhand|Nilfgaard. They've the most to gain! But we'll avenge our sons. We'll burn their shores from Nazair to Etolia!
Donar An Hindar|Wonders abound in the Nilfgaardian army. Towers with wheels, Zerrikanian mercenaries on hump-backed horses… But I've not heard of them havin' trained bears.
Lugos The Mad|This was Crach, I tell ya! We're in his castle, he let 'em in!
Donar An Hindar|Wasted words, Lugos…
Donar An Hindar|I don't know who the traitor is, witcher. But I'll tell you it's none of us. We all lost loved ones.
Geralt|How'd all of you manage to survive?
Holger Blackhand|What're you sayin'? Eh? That we're the ones schemed this up?
Lugos The Mad|Shut your gob. You're cluckin' as foolish as a gander hatchin' eggs! We survived because we're the best warriors in Skellige.
Donar An Hindar|You're both damned fools.
Donar An Hindar|If not for the witcher… none of us would be alive.
Geralt|So long.
Geralt|Wanted to talk to you.
Donar An Hindar|Very well. Speak.
<|endoftext|>
Hjort|Freya, our mother, may the sea swallow the traitors. Freya, our lady…
Geralt|Mind if I interrupt?
Hjort|Already have. What is it?
Geralt|Someone spiked one of the mead barrels. With blood and something else, an herb or a mushroom. Cerys said--
Hjort|Give me the horn.
Hjort|I know the smell. A mushroom - mardroeme.
Geralt|Mardroeme. Never heard of it.
Hjort|You've another name for it on the Continent. Psilocybe, I believe?
Geralt|All right. Peasants eat it to soothe pain.
Hjort|Udalryk tried it, too… but only a few times. In larger doses, the mushroom causes visions, nightmares.
Cerys|Yes, the last thing Udalryk needed more of. Thanks for your help.
Cerys|Blood and mardroeme. The taste of human flesh and a substance that triggers visions. That well could've caused the rage, maybe even the transformation.
Geralt|Maybe. Hard to believe someone spiked the mead here in the hall, though, in front of all those witnesses.
Cerys|You're right. I helped prepare for the feast… I'd 'ave noticed.
Cerys|It might've happened before they brought the drink upstairs. In the cellars, maybe?
Cerys|C'mon. We could find some clues there.
Geralt|Mardroeme related in any way to berserkers?
Hjort|Aye… But only in the tales told to children as they're put to sleep on cold winter nights.
Hjort|Warriors who ate mardroeme were said to transform into beasts when consumed by battle rage. But as I said, it's only…
Geralt|Only a legend, I know. Still, I find it easier to believe than some story about bears appearing out of nowhere.
Geralt|Cerys wasn't lying. You know your fungi.
Hjort|I do. Especially those which affect the mind, soothe it, summon waking dreams.
Hjort|Udalryk suffered for years. I tried to help him in various ways. Initially with prayer, then with poppy milk.
Cerys|But he's done with that now, right?
Hjort|It's not that simple… But we'll wean him off it yet.
<|endoftext|>
Arnvald|No an Craite should ever sit on Skellige's throne. I know you better than others do - you're hot-headed, irresponsible…
Arnvald|Skellige needs stability, a strong king. Not the kind a band of drunken jarls will choose.
Cerys|Curious. Never heard you voice that idea. But I do know one who never stops saying it.
Cerys|And I know the colors those men wore. That was the Clan Tuirseach tartan.
Cerys|It's her. She's behind all this, isn't she?
Arnvald|Yes. Birna Bran.
Geralt|Everyone needs to hear this. Let's get back to Kaer Trolde.
Cerys|Will you tell the council of jarls of the plot?
Arnvald|I will. I was ready to die for Birna… But not like this.
Cerys|The Thing will need to convene. Let's go!
Geralt|What was her motive?
Cerys|It's obvious. She schemed this up to get rid of the other claimants, slander our clan in the process.
Cerys|If she'd succeeded, Svanrige would've been left the only claimant to Skellige's throne.
Arnvald|Why did you help me?
Cerys|Because I want to hear why you betrayed my father, my brother and our clan! Say it to my face!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|We need proof. Your word against Birna's - that's not enough.
Cerys|Arnvald, help us, and I'll ask my da to grant you an honorable death. I'll insist.
Arnvald|I've letters from her… instructions, how to poison the mead. But she never signed them, there's no seal.
Geralt|Will that be enough?
Cerys|It'll have to be… We shouldn't delay. Time to gather the jarls.
Cerys|It's Birna Bran, isn't it?
Cerys|You were never a good liar, Arnvald.
Geralt|What was her motive?
Cerys|It's obvious. She schemed this up to get rid of the other claimants, slander our clan in the process.
Cerys|If she'd succeeded, Svanrige would've been left the only claimant to Skellige's throne.
Geralt|Why'd you betray them? Talk. Or I'll finish what I started.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|An empty envelope. Hm… scent's familiar…
Cerys|Must say I envy you that.
Geralt|Ambergris… Means a user of perfume. That's the scent to follow.
Cerys|Here's his room. Arnvald slept there, by the wall.
Geralt|Clothes all over the place. Think Arnvald might've been in a hurry.
Cerys|And a lone shoe. Unlike him - he paid attention to how he looked.
Geralt|Wonder where the other one is.
Cerys|Think that important?
Geralt|Was wearing both on the beach. Remember that clearly 'cause he didn't have much else on. Now where could it be?
Geralt|Shoes are of a pair.
Geralt|Got a shoe under the table.
Geralt|Hm… Something inside it.
Geralt|Arnvald must've kicked it in his rush to get away.
Geralt|Beautiful things… all pretty much useless to us.
Cerys|We should take everythin' anyway. Never know what could be important.
Geralt|Right.
Geralt|"The Song of Bran the Conqueror."
Cerys|Bran the Conqueror's a hero to Clan Tuirseach. He took Skellige's crown by force, was killed soon after.
Geralt|Interesting, but it's hardly proof.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|A hidden compartment…? Hm, maybe oughta try Arnvald's key?
Cerys|A letter. I told you!
Geralt|Smell it? Birna's perfume…
Cerys|Never liked it, horribly suffocating. Might've guessed it was her.
Geralt|Read that letter already.
Cerys|Instructions on how to spike the mead… Some promises. But it's neither signed nor sealed.
Geralt|Think it's enough?
Cerys|It's got to be. We shouldn't delay any longer. Time to gather the jarls.
Geralt|What was her motive?
Cerys|It's obvious. She schemed this up to get rid of the other claimants, slander our clan in the process.
Cerys|If she'd succeeded, Svanrige would've been left the only claimant to Skellige's throne.
Cerys|It was her after all…
Geralt|Too bad she didn't set her official seal to it…
Cerys|Didn't have to. Look - a hair.
<|endoftext|>
Hjalmar|Right, we're here.
Geralt|Meaning? Gonna explain what we're doing or not?
Hjalmar|Remember the wild men I sparred with? The ones we called Vildkaarls?
Geralt|You might've mentioned them when I walked in…
Hjalmar|This is Fornhala. Their village.
Hjalmar|They were the ones who changed into bears. Just like in the legends about berserkers. I saw it with my own eyes - might've been alone in that. Everyone else was starin' at young Lugos.
Hjalmar|He claimed he could down a barrel of beer in one go. Almost did it, too.
Geralt|So what now?
Hjalmar|Simple. We welcomed the Vildkaarls under our roof, gave them food, drink… And they spilled our blood.
Hjalmar|So now they must pay. In blood.
Geralt|Nice and simple. Kind of plan I like.
Hjalmar|And that's why I like you. Come on, Wolf. The skalds'll sing of our vengeance on the bears.
Geralt|Should at least take one alive, make him testify before--
Hjalmar|This ain't the Continent, witcher. Don't need no court to see justice done.
Geralt|Stopped to consider that somebody might've duped them, used them?
Hjalmar|Then they'll die for bein' idiots. Enough jabberin', already. Let's go.
Geralt|Vildkaarls - what else do you know about 'em?
Hjalmar|They're not part of any clan. They've no wives nor children.
Geralt|So how do they reproduce? By budding?
Hjalmar|No. Those wishin' to devote their lives to battle come here to join them.
Hjalmar|In the summertime they hunt, go on raids. Come winter they sleep in caves… with the bears. Least that's what folk say.
Geralt|Got a feeling it's more than gossip.
Geralt|Why not speak up right away? Back there, in front of everyone?
Hjalmar|Cause they'd 'ave started talkin'. Questionin', quarrelin'.
Hjalmar|Words won't wipe the shame from my clan. Only deeds will.
Geralt|Mhm. Tough to miss.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|An old shrine… covered in runes.
Hjalmar|I know the signs. Language of our forefathers.
Hjalmar|"Svalblod." Dammit…
Geralt|What is it? That a name?
Hjalmar|Aye. A deity whose worship is banned. All altars devoted to him were razed years ago… Priests extollin' him were bound, tossed into sailless longboats that were pushed out to sea.
Geralt|Doesn't make sense to fear the gods. Only ever dangerous in stories.
Hjalmar|The gods don't concern me… Their followers do.
Hjalmar|You see… Svalblod demands sacrifices. Human sacrifices.
Hjalmar|Sword at the ready, witcher.
Geralt|*Sniffs* Strange smell. Bit like incense… Bit like a bait we witchers use.
Hjalmar|For what?
Geralt|Bears.
Hjalmar|Crikey, you've a sniffer like a hound's.
Geralt|Better. Follow me.
Geralt|What'd this deity do to earn condemnation?
Hjalmar|Him? Nothin'. But those who promised him almost drowned Skellige in blood.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|No women's clothing, items… No toys.
Hjalmar|Vildkaarls don't have families.
Hjalmar|Won't be anyone to mourn them.
Hjalmar|Told you - only men live in Fornhala.
Geralt|Spiked gloves… black with dried blood.
Geralt|Ochre, coal dust, woad. Tattoo dyes.
Hjalmar|I'll bloody give 'em tattoos…
Geralt|Human scalps… Unusual as decorations go.
Geralt|Dried mushrooms. Psilocybe, I think.
Hjalmar|Geralt, finish up your ferretin' already.
<|endoftext|>
Hallgrim|Lookin' for death?
Hjalmar|Nay. Vengeance.
Geralt|And answers. Why'd you attack Kaer Trolde?
Hallgrim|We didn't come to the feast to kill. But we've no regrets about what happened there.
Hallgrim|There are weaklings in every herd. They must die to make room for those of strong blood.
Geralt|Strong blood? What're you talking about?
Hallgrim|I speak of the she-bear and her cub.
Hjalmar|We've talked enough.
Hallgrim|Good. Talkin' tires me.
Geralt|Like the men whose corpses we found?
Hallgrim|Aye. Those who wish to join us enter the Ursine Circle in groups of six… We take only three.
Hallgrim|The weak give their lives in sacrifice. The strong start their lives anew.
<|endoftext|>
Hjalmar|Our forebears forbade all from worshippin' Svalblod. On pain of death.
Skellige Druid 05|What?! Where'd you--
Geralt|From Kaer Trolde. Bet you know why we're here.
Skellige Druid 05|Aye. On a matter that's naught to you, mutant. A matter of pride and honor.
Geralt|True, not my concern. Hjalmar, he's all yours.
Hjalmar|I could just butcher you like a swine… but I'll let you die with honor. Defend yourself!
Geralt|Didn't see any honor in what happened at Crach's castle. That was a massacre, plain and simple.
Skellige Druid 05|You see in darkness, yet are still blind.
Skellige Druid 05|We spilled that blood for Skellige. For a king we can be proud of.
Geralt|Don't give a damn about your motivations. Gimme a name.
Skellige Druid 05|I'd sooner die than tell you.
<|endoftext|>
Hjalmar|Not afraid to die. Gotta give 'em that.
Geralt|A letter… Turns out the Vildkaarls - unwitting tools. This druid, Artis, was to be the new king's advisor… Cheap reward for siccing the Vildkaarls on your guests, causing all that bloodshed.
Hjalmar|Who signed it?
Geralt|Nobody. Anonymous.
Hjalmar|There's someone else behind it all, all the mayhem.
Geralt|What now?
Hjalmar|I'll tell the jarls what we found here. Hope it's enough to clear the clan's name.
Hjalmar|C'mon. We're done here.
Geralt|Suspect anyone?
Hjalmar|I know many who crave the crown… But none who'd stoop so low to get it.
Geralt|Whoever it is, they could strike again.
Hjalmar|And I'll be on my guard.
Hjalmar|You were right…
<|endoftext|>
Donar An Hindar|I've assembled the jarls in council as you demanded, Cerys an Craite. You claim to know who's behind the slaughter at Kaer Trolde.
Donar An Hindar|Speak, then! The blood of Skellige's sons and daughters - whose hands does it stain?
Cerys|Birna Bran's.
Lady Bran|The lass is mad! Do you think anyone will believe you?
Cerys|You had them serve poisoned mead to the berserkers.
Lady Bran|I beg your pardon?! The servants of Kaer Trolde are not mine to command! 'Twas your father who called for the feast, who assembled the guests!
Holger Blackhand|There's reason in these words…
Cerys|Twas my father's cupbearer Arnvald who helped him. Birna bribed Arnvald. He tried to kill me and the witcher.
Crach|What?! Arnvald?!
Lugos The Mad|Aww, shite. Arnvald is Crach's loyal dog.
Lady Bran|I thank you, Lugos… But so be it - let us hear the slander you've commanded him to repeat. Bring him in.
Cerys|He's dead. And I wager it was you who silenced him.
Lady Bran|I am not surprised to see you lie, Cerys… After all, like father, like daughter. But your lie is clumsy, and that does surprise me.
Donar An Hindar|Silence, Birna! And you, Cerys… How do you aim to prove your accusation?
Geralt|Got one more piece of evidence.
Cerys|A letter from Birna to Arnvald - instructing him how to spike the mead.
Lady Bran|It lacks my signature. It lacks my seal.
Cerys|But the hand is that of a woman, and you--
Lady Bran|Hahahaha!
Lady Bran|Is this your proof, lass? Is this what you call evidence of my supposed treason? Don't make me laugh.
Donar An Hindar|Birna's right, Cerys. 'Tis all precious little proof of her wrongdoin'.
Donar An Hindar|Alas, your brother Hjalmar also has not presented anythin' that could clear your family's name… We've but one path left to us.
Donar An Hindar|Holger! Lugos! It's time we quit this damned castle. Come, we must decide what punishment Clan an Craite will face.
Geralt|I'm sorry, Cerys.
Svanrige|Wait! Mother… You bade me to leave the hall before the feast. Why?!
Lady Bran|Son… Not now.
Svanrige|Why did you do it?! How did you know?! How?!
Svanrige|You stand silent.
Svanrige|You gave Cerys no credence. Gave the witcher no credence. But you must give credence to a son who accuses his own mother.
Svanrige|The massacre was her doing. She's shamed herself, me, the family… the clan!
Lady Bran|Svanrige… I did it for you! Only for you!
Donar An Hindar|You admit to this deed.
Donar An Hindar|As the eldest of the jarls I cleanse the name of Clan an Craite… and you, Birna Bran, I sentence to death.
Donar An Hindar|You will be chained to a rock to perish of hunger and thirst, and sea fowl will peck apart your remains.
Geralt|You're making a big mistake.
Lady Bran|Silence, wanderer.
Cerys|But perfume's soaked through the parchment. A very strong scent, you know. Still to be sensed.
Geralt|Arnvald fled Kaer Trolde, rode to an agreed meeting point. The warriors who awaited him there tried to kill him.
Holger Blackhand|What's that to do with Birna?
Arnvald|Those men wore Clan Tuirseach colors.
Lady Bran|This is no proof. It is inconclusive. Anyone might have donned our tartans.
Donar An Hindar|Have you any proof to confirm your accusation?
Cerys|I've better. I've a witness. Arnvald!
Arnvald|Cerys speaks true. Birna commanded me to poison the mead. When Cerys and the witcher descended into the cellars--
Crach|You betrayed us? The clan that took you in?!
Lady Bran|Good men! He's a servant to an Craite, a lackey! He will say what they command him to say! He would lie for them even were he to pay for it with his head!
Lugos The Mad|Birna speaks true. Arnvald has served at Kaer Trolde ever since I remember. Loyally, like a dog.
Lady Bran|Hahahahaha!
Geralt|I can vouch for Cerys. She's telling the truth.
Lady Bran|You? Yet another an Craite lackey?
Lady Bran|Did Cerys entice you to cooperate? I can imagine how. Or has Crach paid you to smear my name?
Crach|What did you say?!
Donar An Hindar|Calm yourselves!
Udalryk|After what I saw on Spikeroog, I trust the witcher. More than I do you.
Lady Bran|You've that right. But it's no proof of my guilt.
Crach|To blacken my clan's name, put your son on the throne. Or would you yourself rule? With the blood of our children on your hands?
Lady Bran|Svanrige… You… You must believe me. I had naught to do with this. I swear to you!
Svanrige|Oh gods… You… You're lying!
Donar An Hindar|Your own son stands against you.
<|endoftext|>
Hjalmar|It was them attacked us. The Vildkaarls.
Donar An Hindar|Will you claim they turned into bears? That they're the berserkers our nanny's scared us with as children? Is that it?
Hjalmar|I saw them transform. With my own eyes.
Lugos The Mad|Did you see Freya ride by astride a wild boar as well?
Lugos The Mad|You've discovered as much as your sister. That's to say, nothin'.
Geralt|I'll vouch for Hjalmar.
Lugos The Mad|Why would we believe you, eh? You're a lackey to an Craite.
Donar An Hindar|And a witcher. He knows beasts, including those that take on human form.
Udalryk|Go on, Hjalmar.
Hjalmar|What about? I found the traitors, wrought vengeance on them. That's everything.
Geralt|No, not everything. The Vildkaarls conspired with someone. Found a letter on one of their corpses.
Lady Bran|Vague. This does not identify the guilty party.
Donar An Hindar|That's not why we've gathered.
Donar An Hindar|You washed away disgrace with the blood of our foes, Hjalmar. I, eldest among the jarls, cleanse your clan's name.
Donar An Hindar|We part in peace.
Geralt|Send men to Fornhala, then you'll believe.
Lugos The Mad|Been there. A shabby village, a few huts. What's there of interest?
Hjalmar|A temple: to Svalblod.
<|endoftext|>
Crach|Hm, but enough. Whatever comes, we must endure. I thank you, Geralt. Again.
Geralt|No need. Again.
Crach|I'll not take any more of this modesty. This is a land of heroes! Let this remind you of that.
Crach|And now… I must ride for Geddyneith, for the jarls' council. Time to pick a king.
Geralt|What do you think - who'll get the nod?
Crach|Come with me, see for yourself. All may listen to our deliberations.
Geralt|I do have a horse in the race. Can't refuse, to be honest.
Crach|As I thought. Well, let's go.
Geralt|Might join you later.
Crach|Countin' on it. As are my children.
Crach|Birna had a lust for power, I knew this… But so strong as to commit such a crime?!
Geralt|What about Svanrige? What's his fate?
Crach|He'll lose his home, his name, his honor. He'll chose exile… or death.
Crach|So 'tis true… Warriors who become bears…
Geralt|I'd say it's the opposite. I saw their transformative ritual… Our Trial of the Grasses - pure pleasure by comparison.
Crach|The Vildkaarls have been punished. You and Hjalmar saw to that. But our true foe continues to prowl about. I sense hard times ahead for Skellige.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Congratulations. You'll make a great queen.
Cerys|Thank you. Wouldn't be here if it weren't for you.
Geralt|What's the new queen of Skellige planning?
Cerys|Umm… To listen, learn and listen again. Then we'll see.
Geralt|Good plan.
Cerys|I must unite the clans. I'd rather avoid war, but if Nilfgaard aims to attack, we must repel them together.
Geralt|Drummond folk might be a problem. I saw Lugos during the ceremony - furious, to say the least.
Cerys|There's always been strife between our clans… But I must try and talk to him, just might bring him around.
Geralt|Keep my fingers crossed. Farewell.
Geralt|I was afraid you'd never talk to each other again. After that contest for the crown?
Cerys|Who? Me and Hjalmar? You must be mad.
Geralt|Rivalry certainly seemed serious.
Cerys|Our rivalry's one thing, but we share the same blood - that's what really counts.
Geralt|So, not mad you lost?
Cerys|Naturally I'd rather be standin' where he is now, but… my brother's strong, and he's got charisma. I believe folk'll follow him.
Cerys|And if he grows too high and mighty, father'll cut him down to size, you can be sure o' that.
Geralt|Give him my congratulations.
Cerys|I will.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|You all right?
Hjalmar|So so… Any way you cut it, I was bested by a wench.
Geralt|Not just any wench.
Hjalmar|Aye, true. Suppose if it had to be so, I'm glad it was Cerys.
Geralt|Not even a little proud of her? Come on, admit it.
Hjalmar|A bit, aye, She is the blood of me blood, bone of me bone. But don't tell her I said so. Liable to puff out her chest - which'd do her good, now I think of it.
Hjalmar|We showed Lugos - that's most important. D'you see that rage grip 'im? I thought he'd burst!
Geralt|Yeah. Surprised to see him in that much of a huff, actually.
Hjalmar|Our clans've been buttin' heads, chests, bellies forever. It's the lay o' the land.
Geralt|Take care, Hjalmar.
Geralt|You earned this.
Hjalmar|Didn't I, now? Though truth be told, I'd rather 'ave beat a bugger like Blueboy Lugos. But fuck it - a win's a win. Thanks, mate.
Geralt|What now? Call up the crews, hit Nilfgaard?
Hjalmar|We go back to the Black Ones now. Come out of the sea at them, we'll grind them to dust. Any who remain'll limp fast as they can back to their bloody south.
<|endoftext|>
Hjalmar|Skellige has chosen!
Chorus Skellige|An Craite! An Craite! An Craite! An Craite!
Hjalmar|I know you've long awaited this day.
Hjalmar|We strike at Nilfgaard!
Chorus Skellige|Hjalmar! Hjalmar! Hjalmar! Hjalmar!
Cerys|I know some would see another in my place.
Cerys|I thank those who stood at my side.
Cerys|Here, beneath the Sacred Oak, I pledge to be a good queen to the ones and the others.
Cerys|I want peace and prosperity to reign in Skellige.
Cerys|And I count on you to help me fulfill that dream.
Chorus Skellige|Cerys! Cerys! Cerys! Cerys!
Donar An Hindar|Weren't long ago we gave King Bran back to the sea. Today our mourning ends.
Donar An Hindar|Today, by the grace of the gods and the clans, a new ruler takes the crown.
Donar An Hindar|Let us swear her fealty.
Donar An Hindar|Weren't long ago we gave King Bran back to the sea. Today our mourning ends.
Donar An Hindar|Today, by the grace of the gods and the clans, a new ruler takes the crown.
Donar An Hindar|Let us swear him fealty.
<|endoftext|>
Hjalmar|You did well.
Cerys|Thought you'd be sulkin'.
Hjalmar|Why would I? Showed 'em that even the lasses of Clan an Craite are fit to take the throne.
Cerys|But I beat you.
Hjalmar|If it had to be so, I'm glad it were you and not someone else.
Cerys|You're an idiot as a brother, but you'll make a good king…
Hjalmar|I will.
Hjalmar|And I'm countin' on you bein' at my side when we set out against Nilfgaard.
Cerys|Won't you feel silly? Goin' into battle arm in arm with a woman?
Hjalmar|With my sis, of clan an Craite. Bravest lass the Isles ever made.

Yennefer|Help protect Ciri from the Wild Hunt, and the emperor will grant you amnesty.
Margarita Laux Antille|I hope we can trust you.
Yennefer|You can.
Philippa Eilhart|What of Fringilla?
Yennefer|That I don't know… But I shall take it up with him.
Geralt|You've barely said hello and you're already plotting something.
Yennefer|It's clearly in our nature.
Geralt|Bit about Fringilla - what was that? Triss told me you couldn't contact her.
Yennefer|Perhaps because she sits in the emperor's dungeon, chained in dimeritium.
Yennefer|At least that's what Rita implied.
Geralt|How's Rita know? Barely got out of prison herself.
Yennefer|She spoke to Fringilla before they imprisoned her. Fringilla said that the emperor had summoned her and she'd explain why after the meeting.
Yennefer|No one's heard from her since.
Geralt|Thought this kinda drama only happened around Radovid.
Yennefer|I don't like it. That was not our deal. When it's all over, I'll need to have a candid discussion with the emperor.
Yennefer|Come, they're all waiting for us.
Geralt|Hmm… Take it the emperor forgot to tell you about this?
Geralt|I hear right? You convince the emperor to pardon them?
Yennefer|Provided they help us defend Ciri.
Geralt|Hmm… Got a hard time believing emperor'd go in for a deal like that.
Yennefer|If you can't believe it, don't. I don't need you to.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Can you teleport me onto Emhyr's ship?
Yennefer|Not a chance. It's better shielded than the emperor's alcove.
Triss|Though we could try to force our way through…
Avallach|We need Fringilla in one piece.
Geralt|I'll get on the emperor's ship myself.
Triss|Plan to swim? With swords on your back? You'll get shot up like a sitting duck before you can say "The White Flame Dancing on the Graves of His Foes."
Yennefer|Don't panic. He'll find a way.
Yennefer|Make your approach by night, you'll stand a better chance then. Once you're on board…
Yennefer|Show His Imperial Majesty this letter. Hand it to him directly. We should remind him what he promised, and what he’ll get in return.
Geralt|I'm off.
Cirilla|Good luck.
Geralt|At the moment we don't even know what the Sunstone is.
Avallach|It was created so the Mountain Elves could summon the vessels of the Aen Elle. Now it merely serves as a symbol of a lost opportunity to unite the two tribes…
Avallach|Truly? Can all of you be unfamiliar with the story of Gealbhan and Dillian of the White Fleet?
Geralt|The Sunstone's in Skellige? How do we know that?
Avallach|From legends. Elven ones. It lies where the White Fleet landed centuries ago.
Yennefer|Meaning anywhere on any one of the Isles. Splendid…
Geralt|Ermion - I'll talk to him.
Yennefer|Know where he is?
Geralt|I'll ask around the port. Crach's longships are moored there.
Geralt|Skellige's preparing for war. Kaer Trolde's the only place he could be.
Geralt|What I wanna know is if we'll be able to use the Sunstone.
Avallach|You? No. Me? Naturally.
Avallach|With a touch of help from the sorceresses.
Yennefer|Of whom some are below deck vomiting, while others remain unreachable.
Geralt|Tell us, please. Absolutely love elven legends.
Avallach|Gealbhan was a Sage of the Alder Elves. He fell in love with an Aen Seidhe elf - Dillian. Yet she spurned him.
Cirilla|Ahem. That was a jest on Geralt's part?
Avallach|Too late. It won't hurt any of you to know this. On the day the White Fleet was to set sail, Gealbhan gave Dillian a gift - the Sunstone.
Avallach|He believed Dillian's heart would soften in time.
Avallach|Once her longing for him burgeoned, she was to use the Sunstone. Though worlds away, he would return for her.
Yennefer|Sounds promising. Let's just hope this Sunstone proves more useful to us than it did to that elf woman.
Geralt|Think they know we're here?
Yennefer|Emhyr's mages? Of course.
Geralt|If the matter of Fringilla Vigo were resolved, they'd probably just send her over here in a skiff.
Yennefer|It's far from resolved. The emperor pledged to ensure the Lodge's safety, but…
Triss|Fringilla is a pricklier matter. She's his subject, one officially sentenced to death for treason.
Yennefer|You'll need to learn what Emhyr has planned for her - once we've found a way to toss you over to the imperial flagship.
Cirilla|We must hurry and find the Sunstone. Seems we've plenty to do in Skellige after that.
Yennefer|Fringilla Vigo - we need her here.
<|endoftext|>
Crach|Went to see Lugos. An an Craite on the throne remains a thorn in his arse, heheh. Now he's seen the Black Ones, it pricks him even harder.
Geralt|Think I'll join Ermion. Need to talk to him.
Crach|Go. And when you see that bloody twit Lugos, be sure to tell him-- Argh, best not. The druid knows what to say. Farewell.
Crach|Went to see Lugos. Since Hjalmar took the throne, it's as if someone stuck a goad up the old prick's arse. Now he's seen the Black Ones, bloody believes he'll save Skellige with their aid.
Geralt|Coronation go well?
Crach|Hah! Why should I tell you, Wolf? You might've come. All others did.
Crach|And when I say all, I mean all.
Geralt|Lugos appear as well?
Crach|Yeees, a frown on his face over all three days as if he'd filled his gut with addled oysters and was too sheepish to ask the way to the privy.
Crach|Might've guessed then he'd not relent.
Crach|Went to see Lugos. Since Cerys took the throne, it's as if someone stuck a goad up the old prick's arse. Now he's seen the Black Ones, bloody believes he'll save Skellige with their aid.
Crach|Wolf, did you see? The black dogs in their rickety tubs! They bay at our gates, seek to strike fear in our hearts!
Geralt|Saw 'em all. Where's Ermion?
Crach|The druid's gone to reason with the dimwitted knob.
<|endoftext|>
Yennefer|I thought you'd wish to see Crach.
Cirilla|It's just that… What if I disappear again tomorrow? For good this time, like my mother did?
Cirilla|I feel like… I shouldn't see anyone who… who is fond of me. At least not until we defeat the Wild Hunt.
Triss|We can always drop you back on the Isle of Mists.
Cirilla|Heh. Thanks a lot.
Yennefer|Perhaps you should talk to him after all.
Cirilla|What would be the point? Surely none now.
Yennefer|And later? Don't count your father out just because he's the world's richest and most powerful--
Cirilla|…authoritarian rotter unworthy of even one inch of trust?
Yennefer|Actually, of all people, I believe you can trust him, perhaps you even should.
Cirilla|What about the dictatorial rotter part?
Yennefer|Something to get used to.
<|endoftext|>
Lugos The Mad|I'll not kneel before an an Craite! Never! That clear to you?!
Ermion|You prefer to aid the Black Ones?
Lugos The Mad|I'd sooner aid the wraiths of bleedin' Mörhogg than let Crach rule all Skellige!
Ermion|And your men, what do they say? Will they follow you when the jarls call you a traitor?
Lugos The Mad|This here's my land, druid! Watch your words!
Geralt|What would you call it, if not treason?
Lugos The Mad|That your bark before you bite?
Lugos The Mad|Did Crach send you here for my head? Well then, go ahead, try to take it!
Lugos The Mad|Get 'em!
Geralt|Would you be king by Nilfgaard's grace?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Listen, Ermion. Know anything about the Sunstone? Legends place it somewhere in Skellige.
Ermion|The Mask of Uroboros first, now the Sunstone. Monsters may rest easy - you've become a treasure hunter.
Ermion|I've never found the Aen Seidhe elves interesting. But there's a skald, Eyvind - he could help you. Once told me of some inaccessible caverns or ruins or somesuch…
Geralt|Where will I find him?
Ermion|Today? In Arinbjorn, doubtless.
Ermion|You might also ask the pearl divers Erling and Matthias Fishlung. Of late they hunt near the tip of the bay, eastern end.
Geralt|Fishlung? Interesting.
Ermion|So they call him. Submerges for hours at a time.
Ermion|None know how he does it. But I've my suspicions.
Geralt|Hm. Not too fond of him?
Ermion|It's nothing personal. I couldn't stand his father or grandfather either.
Geralt|Thanks for your help.
Ermion|One thing, Geralt. These caves or ruins - Matthias' and Erling's ancestors would've looted them bare centuries ago were they not protected by some magic barrier.
Ermion|Take a sorceress with you. You must've brought at least one along.
Geralt|Whole gaggle, this time.
Ermion|Ugh! Gods protect us.
Geralt|How's Cerys handling things?
Ermion|Has the makings of an excellent queen, if she would only flee her father's shadow.
Ermion|Everyone, Lugos excepted, declared their support for her. Yet the minute the imperial fleet appeared on the horizon, the jarl took matters into his own hands.
Geralt|And Hjalmar?
Ermion|The lad's led three raids against the imperial fleet. All against Crach's will, all failed. Yet he'll find volunteers for another.
Geralt|Yeah, sounds like Hjalmar.
Geralt|Hjalmar handling things all right?
Ermion|Lad's developed quite a taste for heroic adventures. Left ruling the Isles to his father.
Ermion|Quite fortunate, in fact, as now, on the eve of war, we need a more experienced leader.
Geralt|And Cerys?
Ermion|I would say she's being more useful than Hjalmar.
Ermion|So, Clan Drummond will attack sooner then we expected, it seems.
Geralt|Thought Crach sent you to negotiate an agreement with Lugos.
Ermion|Hah! An agreement! Only Crach believes such a thing possible at this stage.
Geralt|Mean I didn't actually ruin things for you?
Ermion|Not this time. Lugos' death stands to change a great deal. His cousin, who will now be named jarl, is a weak commander, stupid. This war will start soon, end even sooner.
Ermion|But why have you returned to Skellige?
Ermion|Well, Geralt, I see no row can occur in Skellige without your participation.
Geralt|Mean and inaccurate, Ermion. Seems to me I've missed quite a few.
Ermion|The blood of Crach's blood sits upon the throne, and that is your doing. I'm afraid you've ignited a small civil war.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Something going on in there?
Donar An Hindar|That slag's sellin' us to the Black Ones! Wanna watch? Go on in!
Geralt|And Svanrige? He is king, after all.
Donar An Hindar|As good a king as a fish's arse is a whistle!
Donar An Hindar|Grrr… I refuse to look upon this disgrace!
Geralt|Looking for Ermion.
Donar An Hindar|Oh, he's in there with 'em, pale as a beached carp. If he don't bring the brat in line, who will?
Donar An Hindar|But no, he says, the gods gave us a king, we must support 'im! Support what? Svanrige standin' there like a mute fencin' dummy, gazin' on as that hag sells us to the Black Ones?
Donar An Hindar|Bran would slit that traitorous bitch's throat were he alive!
Donar An Hindar|And we should've drowned that whelp in deep water the day he was born!
Donar An Hindar|Birna Bran arranged everythin' behind our backs! Why, she's not even denyin' it!
<|endoftext|>
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Who is this?
Lady Bran|No one important.
Lady Bran|As I was saying - we shall discuss the details later. His Majesty accepts the document in its current form.
Udalryk|Never thought I'd live to see the day…
Lady Bran|We are prepared to seal the treaty.
Crach|How much would I need to pay you to take off her head here and now?
Geralt|Same price as for an erynia.
Crach|Tempting.
Lady Bran|The king pledges to fulfill all the conditions by the summer solstice.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Before I sign, I wish to hear this from the king's mouth.
Lady Bran|Svanrige.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Aghh...
Lady Bran|Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
Crach|Tuirseach!
Holger Blackhand|Tuirseach!
Geralt|Do it for free, gladly.
Crach|Ehh.
Geralt|Nothing to be done?
Ermion|It's too late.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Listen, Ermion. know anything about the Sunstone? Legends place it somewhere in Skellige.

Ermion|Ugh! Gods protect us.
Geralt|What happened to Cerys and Hjalmar?
Ermion|Soon as the imperial fleet was spotted on the horizon, Hjalmar rallied the longships, set sail to face it.
Ermion|Cerys went with him… Neither has returned.
Svanrige|We move out at once.
Crach|Ye hear what the king said? Move!
Ermion|Svanrige… Who could've known. The jarls have one they can believe in again.
Ermion|And what brought you here? Come to make sure no scandal in Skellige passes you by?
<|endoftext|>
Eyvind|Not now!
Geralt|Watching for Nilfgaard's fleet?
Eyvind|Fleet? Oh, aye, they mentioned something… Nay, I've more important matters on my mind.
Eyvind|By my calculations, today's the day Gevorg, the legendary white whale, will swim the waters of Skellige.
Eyvind|Been waitin' for this my whole life.
Geralt|Let's watch for Gevorg together. And you can tell me what you know about any elven ruins in Skellige.
Geralt|Heard of some cavern no one's been able to enter?
Eyvind|Good thing, too. Elsewise they'd 'ave plundered it long ago, like all the others.
Eyvind|Hah! Can tell by your mug I was right! And to think, didn't take you for a looter at first…
Geralt|I just wanna look around the cavern. Research.
Eyvind|Research?
Geralt|Writing a historical treatise on the Aen Seidhe elves. Under Ermion's tutelage.
Eyvind|Ermion? Man never cared a whit about the Elves of the Mountains.
Eyvind|I've seen through you, you conniver! Cut me to bits if you like, I'll never tell you about the cavern.
Geralt|Ugh…
Geralt|Writing an adventure novel. Gathering material for it.
Eyvind|Mean to write up the comin' of the White Fleet? Prime idea.
Eyvind|Mayhaps you could use my translation of the Song of Gealbhan and Dillian?
Geralt|Gladly, gladly. So, where's this cavern?
Eyvind|Gotta sail east from Kaer Trolde. Cavern's in a cove, only accessible from the sea.
Geralt|So long. And… good luck with the white whale.
Eyvind|It'll show today. I'm sure of it.
Geralt|Eyvind!
Eyvind|What?
Geralt|I… ugh, just wanted to assure you I only wanna look around the cavern. It's research.
Geralt|What's this whale about?
Eyvind|He's to appear when specters descend from the heavens into the waves, the serpent wakes the sea's wroth, and an icy monster devours an isle.
Eyvind|Be the first bard to compose a ballad about him.
Geralt|Legends don't happen to mention a Curse of the Black Sun, do they?
Eyvind|Black sun? What're you on about?
Geralt|Never mind.
Geralt|Forgetting anything?
Eyvind|Eh? Oh, yes! The pyre. All that chattin'…
Eyvind|I'll be… Tinder's soaked. So what'm I to use to--?
Geralt|Lemme help.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Fringilla… Been a while.
Geralt|The other sorceresses, they're on Gynvael, near Ard Skellig. We could take a boat--
Fringilla Vigo|I'm sick to death of boats.
Geralt|And I despise teleports. But have it your way. Let's go.
Emhyr|Witcher. What a pleasant surprise.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|Hold.
Geralt|Warm welcome. Thank you, Your Majesty.
Emhyr|You should have come with my daughter, your welcome would have been different.
Emhyr|Where is she?
Geralt|Close.
Emhyr|Close, White Wolf, is what you are to decapitation.
Emhyr|You're insolent because you believe I cannot afford to hurt you. And you're right.
Emhyr|Yet that will change one day. When you are no longer indispensable but… disposable.
Emhyr|But enough of that. Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Emhyr|What do you want?
Geralt|Fringilla Vigo. Been told you promised Yennefer you 'd free her. I can see… I know you're a busy man…
Geralt|…so here's a letter. Oughta refresh your memory about the Lodge.
Emhyr|Hm… Even Yennefer's humblest requests seem like threats. I've always liked that about her. Very well, so be it.
Geralt|Time I was on my way.
Emhyr|At last, a point we agree on. Guards! Bring me Fringilla Vigo! You may remove her dimeritium shackles.
Emhyr|No introductions are necessary from what I've heard. Farewell.
Geralt|Truly prepared to forgive them? Amnesty in exchange for help?
Emhyr|I'm prepared to abide by the agreement I made with Yennefer.
Geralt|Didn't answer my question.
Emhyr|Nor must I.
Geralt|In Zerrikania. She longed for sunlight.
Emhyr|I am known neither for my sense of humor nor for my patience.
Emhyr|We are at war, if you've not noticed.
Geralt|I've noticed. Can see the smoke from burning huts miles away.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Run outta pearls?
Skellige Fisherman 02|Not your concern. What the sea gives, we take.
Geralt|Seems she's a reluctant giver.
Skellige Fisherman 01|Aye, I could use a better knife. But a few hours and their fingers are swollen.
Geralt|Listen. Heard you know a thing or two about elven ruins in Skellige.
Skellige Fisherman 01|Who says?
Geralt|Ermion.
Skellige Fisherman 01|Hm. You'll not tell 'im what you saw today, will ya?
Geralt|Depends.
Skellige Fisherman 02|Elven ruins, you say. What you want to know?
Geralt|Druid mentioned some cavern you've never been able to enter. Where is it?
Skellige Fisherman 01|East of Kaer Trolde, in a cove you can only reach from the sea.
Skellige Fisherman 01|But what you exactly… What was that? Ye hear it, Erling?
Skellige Fisherman 02|We got nothin' else for you, so if you're done, we'd rather get back up top.
Geralt|I'm done. And good idea.
Geralt|Plan to return the bodies to their families at least? I mean, once you're done?
Skellige Fisherman 01|They speak true - mutants got nothin' resemblin' refined sentiments.
Skellige Fisherman 01|Look at 'em. You think their ever-lovin' mums and wifeys wanna see 'em in this state?
Skellige Fisherman 01|The sea'll bury them.
Skellige Fisherman 02|And that's that.
Geralt|Risking a lot.
Skellige Fisherman 01|Why? That a threat or somethin'?
Geralt|Don't need to worry about me. But I heard calls underwater. Monsters - must've sensed blood.
Skellige Fisherman 01|Huh. I-I don't… hear nothin'.
Geralt|Ordinary folk never hear these things… till it's too late.
Skellige Fisherman 02|We best get outta here, Matthias.
Geralt|Never heard of Skelligers looting fallen warriors. That a tradition? I mean, these are your own people.
Skellige Fisherman 01|You not have eyes? Whaddaya mean, our own? These are Faroe scum!
Skellige Fisherman 02|Went after the Black Ones with two longships. Fishbrains!
Skellige Fisherman 01|Look, Erling. Told you we wasn't done for the day. Didn't even have to fish this one out.
Skellige Fisherman 02|You daft? Can't you see he's a witcher?
Skellige Fisherman 01|What's a witcher doin' here?
<|endoftext|>
Yennefer|It seems someone was literally just here…
Geralt|Avallac'h's on the ship. We know that.
Yennefer|What if he's not…?
Geralt|Stop.
Geralt|Hm. A distillate? Smells like…
Yennefer|Verbena.
Geralt|Herbs. Not very incriminating.
Yennefer|Wait. We've not examined the entire laboratory yet.
Geralt|A-ha.
Yennefer|"A-ha" what?
Geralt|No, nothing.
Yennefer|Sometimes you really get on my nerves, you know?
Geralt|Avallac'h's assistant, maybe?
Yennefer|No, somehow doesn't seem like Avallac'h to have one.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Pretty cozy. Doesn't look much like a lab at all.
Yennefer|That proves nothing. We must look around.
Cirilla|It's a bit low, isn't it? Rummaging through his papers?
Yennefer|You wished to come, my dear.
Geralt|Portrait of Ciri, I think.
Cirilla|No, that's not me. Where's the scar?
Geralt|It's definitely you. Hm, really captured you.
Geralt|Sure Avallac'h's only interested in you for your magic abilities?
Cirilla|Pfff. Very funny.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Genealogical chart of the Aen Hen Ichaer, the Elder Blood. From Lara Dorren…
Cirilla|To me. You never showed me the full version. I had no idea Videmont of Aedirn was an ancestor.
Cirilla|Was he the one who punished his daughters with a hot iron, or the one who had his own father's eyes gouged out?
Yennefer|Him of the daughters. My, even I'd never seen the full version.
Yennefer|Seems Avallac'h has analyzed all the paths of Lara's gene, even those we thought extinct.
Geralt|Forget this. Not like we're gonna learn anything new.
Yennefer|How can you know?
Cirilla|I don't wish to read this either.
Geralt|Let's look at his notes.
Yennefer|Gods… he's spent over two centuries on this. He was the first to study Lara's gene. Falka… Mh, some entries about Ciri…
Yennefer|But it's here, later, that things get interesting. He actually tried to cultivate a genetic mix like Ciri's. But one excluding the human line.
Cirilla|Meaning what exactly? That I ought to be looking about for giant jars holding my siblings?
Yennefer|Don't be foolish! Avallac'h never got that far. Apparently, all his experiments ended in failure.
Yennefer|You are unique.
Cirilla|And that's why we've the Wild Hunt to contend with.
Cirilla|Let's ferret on - see if we can't find something even more interesting.
Geralt|He's only analyzing - really believe that? If he's anything like our mages, I seriously doubt he's standing back and observing how Lara's descendants are doing.
Yennefer|I don't think we'll ever know if or how deeply the elves have meddled in the gene's mutation.
Cirilla|Did you have a hand in… in what Geralt mentioned? The work of those human mages…
Yennefer|Of course not.
Geralt|Yen…!
<|endoftext|>
Cirilla|What's that?
Geralt|A necklace. Lara Dorren's.
Cirilla|It's beautiful, but…
Geralt|Yours, to wear…
Cirilla|Let's go. I'm sick of this place.
Elf Female 01|How did you get in here?
Geralt|Who are you?
Elf Female 01|Not your concern. Get out of here. Now.
Cirilla|You… I remember you. From Tir ná Lia.
Elf Female 01|Remarkable. I thought all elves looked alike to those of your race. If it's Avallac'h you seek, he's not here.
Cirilla|I know.
Elf Female 01|And yet you come here? What for? To spy on him? He tries his damndest to save you every time you do something stupid - is that not enough?
Cirilla|What can you possibly know about that?
Elf Female 01|You'd be surprised. He's told me a great deal about you.
Geralt|Like what?
Elf Female 01|He said you shared Lara's features - I don't see whatever it is he sees. It seems a bit like trying to drink water from a mud puddle.
Elf Female 01|But… I imagine that belief somehow helps him with his task.
Yennefer|What task?
Elf Female 01|Do you think he trails you everywhere for pleasure? Even I grow ill at the sight of you.
Yennefer|It's incredible how those like you still believe you're superior to humans - in any way.
Elf Female 01|She's no human. She's a degenerate half-breed. To have no choice but to use something like that - it's humiliating.
Yennefer|Another word and I'll--
Elf Female 01|What? You'll change nothing. She must do what she must. Then Avallac'h will finally be free of her.
Cirilla|If he hates me so deeply, why didn't he tell me to my face?
Geralt|Avallac'h means that much to you?
Cirilla|What's that got do to with anything?
Cirilla|If they despise me so, they should leave me be!
Yennefer|Ciri…
Cirilla|What?! Do you fear I'll level this place like I did Kaer Morhen?
Cirilla|Shame I can't do that at will, because I'd really like to now!
Geralt|Calm down. The elf was right.
Cirilla|Argh. Aren't you supposed to cheer me up?
Geralt|You carry Lara's gene - nothing you can do about it. Inherited her talent and her power, too.
Geralt|That she-elf would give up a century of her life to be you.
Cirilla|Certainly didn't seem so.
Geralt|You were born with a great gift. And only you can decide how to use it.
Cirilla|Ha-rah!
Geralt|Ugh!
Cirilla|Eeeeeeerrrgh!
Geralt|Aaa-argh!
Cirilla|There. That's better. Let's get out of here.
Geralt|Ciri, you didn't actually believe her, did you? She's, uh… personally involved in the matter, that's clear.
Cirilla|What of it?
Geralt|Ciri, let's get out of here.
Cirilla|No. I want to listen.
Geralt|We mean you no harm.
Elf Female 01|I care not at all why you're here. Get out.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|I'll go with you.
Cirilla|Thank you.
Cirilla|Could you open a portal - to Hindarsfjall?
Yennefer|I can.
Geralt|Let's do this.
Yennefer|Come back soon, all right?
Cirilla|Mhm. See you.
Geralt|You can take that alone, Ciri. Meet you on Hindarsfjall.
Cirilla|As you wish. I'll be at the graveyard.
Yennefer|Please get it done quickly. And Ciri, try not to get into any trouble, all right?
Cirilla|Certainly don't plan to. See you.
Geralt|Ciri, no time for that.
Yennefer|You can go later. We've more important things to do now.
Cirilla|Yes. There are always more important things.
Yennefer|I'll talk to her. You're liable to spill.
Cirilla|Must we return to the boat right away?
Geralt|Something else you wanna see?
Cirilla|Not here. On Hindarsfjall. In Lofoten. I met a young man, Skjall, and I'd like…
Cirilla|What is it?
Yennefer|Ciri, Skjall is dead.
Cirilla|The Wild Hunt… Everyone…? No one survived?
Yennefer|Skjall died later.
Cirilla|You sure it was him? You'd met him?
Yennefer|I was there. I saw his body.
Cirilla|Will you visit his grave with me? I'd like to… to say goodbye.
<|endoftext|>
Cirilla|Glad you made it. I'd started to think you wouldn't find the time.
Geralt|You don't mean that.
Geralt|So… find the grave?
Cirilla|No, I can't stand graveyards. Really dislike wandering them alone.
Geralt|Let's look around together. Come on.
Cirilla|Lasse, son of Njord… Olaf, son of Ove… Ynge, daughter of Trottnir…
Cirilla|Dammit. He's not here. Skjall has no grave!
Cirilla|Geralt, I shan't leave until I bury him.
Cirilla|Think… The body… What could have become of it?
Geralt|They didn't burn it. Save that honor for kings and heroes. Doubt they left him in the garden, too. Hm.
Cirilla|Ugh. Bastards!
Geralt|What?
Cirilla|Beyond the village - there's a pit. They fill it with sheep taken by blackleg. Crabs pick at their bones at night.
Geralt|Graveyards, not my favorite either.
Cirilla|Why not?
Geralt|Remind me of work.
Geralt|Never been to a cemetery to visit someone's grave. Always hunting some ghoul or rotfiend.
Cirilla|Ah, frankly, I'd rather have come here with a contract, to do some witchers' work.
Geralt|Let's look around. Should be a relatively fresh grave mound.
Cirilla|Thank you for coming. I detest graveyards, especially wandering them alone.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Woman 02|What're you doin'?
Cirilla|What you should've done long ago. We're burying Skjall.
Skellige Warrior 01|Buryin' Craven? You defy the writ of the elders.
Skellige Warrior 01|Begone, leave this place. You defile our laws!
Geralt|Lower your voice. Before we need another grave.
Skellige Woman 02|How can you defend him?!
Skellige Warrior 01|Craven's place is in the ditch.
Cirilla|Ugh. Skjall saved your bloody lives!
Cirilla|The Wild Hunt was after me. Had Skjall not led me away then… Why, they would've reduced Lofoten to ash.
Skellige Woman 02|What would the specters be wantin' of some lass who--
Cirilla|I am not some lass. And anyone who so much as touches this grave will learn that the hard way.
Skellige Warrior 01|Aye, none will disturb it. Desecratin' graves - well… it's the only thing elders punish harder than fleein' the battlefield.
Skellige Warrior 01|And what you said… Can't know the truth of it. The gods'll judge Skjall now.
Cirilla|We were right to come.
Cirilla|I was deeply troubled. You've no idea.
Geralt|Well, they shouldn't spit on his name anymore.
Cirilla|Let's go.
Geralt|Back to the boat.
Cirilla|Mhm.
Geralt|Go back alone. Need to tend to something.
Cirilla|Very well. I'll see you.
Geralt|We're not bound by them.
Skellige Woman 02|Aye, and you've clearly no respect for our customs, either.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Going somewhere?
Yennefer|Ciri says there's a site in Skellige we must examine. Avallac'h's clearly hiding something from us.
Cirilla|Earlier, when we were in the Isles together, Avallac'h mentioned a laboratory.
Cirilla|At one point, he wished to teleport there… to retrieve something. And he refused to take me with him. It was all very strange…
Yennefer|Sufficiently suspicious, don't you think?
Geralt|So what? Wanna just sneak in and root around?
Cirilla|Exactly. Coming with?
Geralt|Fine. Where is it?
Cirilla|On a small isle between Undvik and Spikeroog.
Geralt|Not exactly on our way. Just found out the Sunstone's on Ard Skellig. Cavern along the coast, that we can only access from the sea.
Geralt|Gonna need some real magic to get in, too.
Philippa Eilhart|Go find this laboratory. I will explore Ard Skellig. You can join me later.
Yennefer|Philippa, your eyesight - only just recovered and magically simulated. Didn't you say you'd need some time to get accustomed?
Philippa Eilhart|Did I?
Yennefer|I'd forgotten how irritating she can be. Come, Ciri.
Yennefer|We'll await you there.
Geralt|Making too much of it. Avallac'h's as secretive as any elf. What're your suspicions, exactly?
Cirilla|I… don't know, Geralt. I've a feeling it's important. Come with us.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What now?
Philippa Eilhart|It appears I must do everything for you.
Philippa Eilhart|See the sentry who seems to be waiting for payment?
Geralt|I'm fresh out of change.
Philippa Eilhart|Ugh. In blood, not coin. The sentry is Fiallan, of the elven legend. Do you literally read nothing?
Philippa Eilhart|There you are.
Philippa Eilhart|Yennefer must have tremendous pull with the emperor. To get him to guarantee the Lodge's safety? What's your take on it?
Geralt|My take? Obviously a leading question. No "Geralt, I'm tired, let's sit and chat a bit" first?
Philippa Eilhart|Is foreplay that important to you?
Geralt|This deal with Emhyr - it's sorceress business. Pick someone else's brain.
Philippa Eilhart|So she's not told you anything? What about personal plans?
Philippa Eilhart|Has she mentioned anything? A possible advisory position? Beside a young, promising empress?
Geralt|Stay away from Ciri.
Philippa Eilhart|She's an adult, Geralt. You keep forgetting. She can decide for herself.
Philippa Eilhart|So, onward?
Geralt|You oughta talk to Yennefer. Painfully clear there's unfinished business there.
Philippa Eilhart|Yennefer's always walked her own path. I'm actually touched she decided to take an interest in matters of the Lodge this time.
Geralt|You don't trust her. So once the Hunt's defeated, leave, find asylum elsewhere. I hear Redania's offering.
Philippa Eilhart|I'd sooner stick my head in a zeugl's spiky orifice. Thanks, but I've other plans.
Geralt|You'll get to work with the emperor. Not excited?
Philippa Eilhart|No. I-I mean, yes, of course I am. Thus far the Lodge has oft banked on weak rulers. It's been one of our biggest mistakes.
Geralt|Hm… So you're impressed Emhyr keeps his mages on a short leash.
Philippa Eilhart|Yennefer's wise to keep you out of politics. I'm afraid you'd not realize which way the wind was blowing if you pissed straight into it.
<|endoftext|>
Philippa Eilhart|You may go. I know you've things to do. I shall find my own way back.
Philippa Eilhart|At laaaast…
Geralt|Hand it over, and let's get outta here.
Philippa Eilhart|Not so fast. We've a matter to discuss.
Geralt|Lemme guess - you gotta fly. You're about to tell me why you need the Sunstone so much more than we do. Then you'll change into an owl and - whoosh!
Philippa Eilhart|No idea where you got such a ridiculous notion. Ciri's safety is most important to me now.
Philippa Eilhart|But I wish to talk to you about the future. My future.
Geralt|You'll like Nilfgaard - no two ways about it. I recommend the fresh alpine air of Nazair.
Philippa Eilhart|Hahah, and Yennefer claims you have no sense of humor. Now listen carefully.
Philippa Eilhart|Once we've defeated the Hunt and Ciri is safe, Yennefer's meteoric rise at the imperial court will come to an abrupt end.
Philippa Eilhart|Which is wonderful from my perspective. I'm not interested in reviving the Lodge if I'm not to have the deciding vote.
Geralt|You're telling me this because…?
Philippa Eilhart|If I know even one bit, I expect that once we've defeated the Wild Hunt, you aim to slip out the back door, with Ciri… to disappear into the wilds, correct?
Philippa Eilhart|All very romantic, but perhaps instead of destroying the girl's life, you could take Yennefer with you. And go.
Geralt|Any other words of wisdom? Or can we go?
Geralt|You wanna take Yen's place at Emhyr's side.
Philippa Eilhart|And at Ciri's.
Philippa Eilhart|I think you understand it's inevitable. And I would truly prefer Yennefer to be far away when it happens.
Philippa Eilhart|Holding her in the imperial dungeon would be costly. And it would give the wrong impression.
Geralt|Triss might object.
Philippa Eilhart|Ah, yes. So give Yennefer some friendly advice, would you? She'll listen to you.
Geralt|Wouldn't worry. Emperor's got plans for you, I'm sure.
Philippa Eilhart|Stop playing the jester and listen to me carefully.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|So maybe you're hoping to gain control of Lara herself? After all these years?
Avallach|Lara is dead. My only hope is that Ciri will fulfill her calling and survive.
Geralt|Ran into someone at your lab.
Avallach|Did you, now?
Geralt|Mhm. A she-elf. Claimed you hate Ciri. So how's that fit you trying to protect her, whatever the cost?
Avallach|Not at all.
Avallach|You don't really expect me to confess my feelings to you, do you?
Geralt|I believe you.
Avallach|I know. You'd never let me within five hundred yards of Ciri otherwise.
Geralt|Went by your laboratory.
Avallach|I trust you did not make a mess.
Geralt|Didn't mention you were the Aen Elle elves' chief source of knowledge about Ciri's abilities.
Avallach|I didn't mention many things. Fortunately, they're no longer important.
Geralt|Your experiments with the gene, Elder Blood - that's not important?
Avallach|I pursued those studies to protect Ciri. To protect Lara Dorren's blood, in whomever's veins it courses.

Menge|Our Novigrad - shining and brilliant! Pearl amongst cities! Cradle of the Eternal Fire!
Menge|Yet it is here that darkness raises its hideous head!
Menge|A deceitful doppler doubling as commander of the Guard!
Menge|A band of charlatans, diviners and witches poised to pinch your purity and prosperity!
Menge|The time has come for this to end! For us to cast off evil! Do you renounce evil?!
Chorus Novigrad|We renounce evil!
Menge|Do you renounce evil?!
Chorus Novigrad|We renounce it!
Menge|May the Holy Flame of the Eternal Fire complete this cleansing, this purging of pestilence into purity!
Menge|How are we to fight a pestilence that changes form?!
Menge|None can be certain of his father, brother or bride!
Menge|Look upon your neighbor, for he too could be a doppler!
Menge|Will we submit to uncertainty?! Will we allow monsters and charlatans to overrun our city?!
Chorus Novigrad|No!
Menge|May the Holy Flame of the Eternal Fire complete this act of cleansing!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Want you gone by the time I count to three. One…
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|Hear that?
Geralt|Two…
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Ooh, lookie. Thinks he can scare us off.
Geralt|Three…
Geralt|Not here for the loot. Interested in the sorceress who lived here.
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|We're supposed to believe that?
Geralt|Yeah.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Most likely hidin' in some rattrap with the rest of 'em.
Geralt|Someone's gotta know more.
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|I'd look for 'er in the Putrid Grove.
Geralt|Putrid Grove - where is it?
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|I wouldn't know. Rumor has it it's a place for freaks and oddities.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|You'd fit in well there.
Geralt|Maybe. Thing is, gotta know how to get there.
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|They say you gotta get there through the sewers, but you gotta enter them outside of town. Few know where exactly, though.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Ask a beggar. Or spot yourself a thief, follow him… Beggars and thieves gotta pay tribute to the King of Beggars. Word is they do it in the Grove.
Geralt|Mean to say the local beggars have a king? Crown, scepter and all that?
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Wouldn't scoff, mate. King of Beggars, it's a moniker, yeah, for a man who everyone in Novigrad respects deeply.
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|And watch yourself. Menge himself don't even go to the Grove.
Menge|Someone call for me? Wonder why.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|It's Menge…
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|Temple Guard…
Menge|Thieving vermin to the confession chamber.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|But, sir… What's the offense? This is some sorceress bitch's shop!
Menge|Think that gives you the right to steal her property?
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|Well… Sorcerers, mages of all types are outlaws…
Menge|But by law, the Temple Guard takes possession of their belongings. And the rule of law still holds in Novigrad.
Menge|You know a bat can sniff out a moth a mile away?
Geralt|Small animals - can't say I'm really interested.
Menge|I know your trade. Spotted those yellow eyes amidst the rabble in the square right away.
Menge|Did you notice how much common folk love flames? The Eternal Fire will consume them all one day, one way or another.
Menge|And as bats sense moths, so I sense freaks. And start by warning them - Novigrad's no place for your kind.
Geralt|I haven't done anything wrong.
Menge|But you will. Sooner or later your sort always causes trouble. And this city's mine to protect.
Menge|Mine, and the Eternal Fire's.
Menge|Nothing I can do to you now, but just know that I know you're here. One misstep, one error… You'll make a mistake, it's inevitable…
Menge|I'll be the first to learn of it. And when I do, it'll be standard procedure. Like for every magic oddity who dares taint this city's air.
Menge|Be seeing you.
Geralt|Heard Novigrad was no place for mages. Now you're telling me it's no place for witchers. So who's it a place for?
Menge|Righteous folk professing the one true faith in the Eternal Fire.
Geralt|Got nothing to do with their sense of smell. It's about their hearing.
Menge|Well, well… Man knows his bats. Here I thought you only cared about monsters.
Geralt|What's your point?
Menge|I ask the questions… witcher.
Geralt|Putrid Grove… Interesting as names go.
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|A hive of scum and freakery, if there ever was one. No decent folk show their hides there.
Geralt|That why you think I should look for my friend there?
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|I meant no offense.
Geralt|Who's she hiding from?
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|Temple Guard's crackin' down. All mages're fair game.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|They round 'em up like rats.
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|Calm, now… W-we'll split it. Plenty for everyone.
Geralt|I'm not a thief. Looking for the sorceress who lived here.
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|Ah! Nah… don't! No more, please!
Geralt|Where's the sorceress who lived here?
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Hey! Sod off! We're lootin' here.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Here.
Novigrad Beggar 02|Thank you, you gold-hearted man! Care to hear me tale o' woe?
Geralt|Some other time. I'm in a hurry.
Geralt|All right, I'll give you some coin, but you gotta tell me where the Putrid Grove is.
Novigrad Beggar 02|I don't know that. Keep your coin, I don't know a thing. Move on. Begone.
Geralt|Get out of my way.
Novigrad Beggar 02|What's a crown to a gentleman like you? Easy as spitting!
Geralt|Piss off while I'm still willing to let you go.
Novigrad Beggar 02|Sir, sir! Be merciful. Give us a crown, eh? Me mum's sick and if I don't feed her, well, she's like to die o' hunger!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|There. Now tell me where the Putrid Grove is. It's the least you could do.
Novigrad Beggar 01|I don't know and believe you me - I don't wanna know. Gods protect.
Geralt|You didn't tell me anything.
Novigrad Beggar 01|I don't know nothin'. On your way - I've no use for you.
Novigrad Beggar 01|Look kindly on a wretched soul, aid one who last saw nourishment three days past?
Geralt|All right. Give you a crown.
Novigrad Beggar 01|Crown's enough, m'lord, when your gut's so empty it's stuck flat to your spine.
Geralt|Could give you more, on one condition - you tell me where you drop your takings for the day.
Novigrad Beggar 01|I drop 'em with m'lady. Serious trouble if I didn't.
Geralt|I think you take them to the Putrid Grove.
Novigrad Beggar 01|Far as I'm concerned, the King of Beggars can stick his crown up his arse then shove it even deeper with his scepter. Bugger won't get a broken copper from me!
Geralt|You're either pretty damn brave… Or just plain stupid.
Novigrad Beggar 01|What's he gonna do? Break me legs? Let him! Me takings double as a cripple.
Geralt|From what I hear, they'd break your legs just to start…
Novigrad Beggar 01|Some coin for me future widow, then?
Geralt|Go on lying like that and you won't get a thing.
Novigrad Beggar 01|I swear it! Honest as a child, I am, m'lord.
Geralt|I know you pay tribute to the King of Beggars. Don't have a choice.
Geralt|So long.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Beggar 02|Take pity on me misery, good folk, and aid a man crippled by misfortune.
Geralt|Word is nothing's free in Novigrad.
Novigrad Beggar 02|Hnn, another one come burstin' with questions. Now where'd you folk gain the idea we beggars know everythin'?
Novigrad Beggar 02|"I need to see this'un, I need to find that one." "Who robbed me brother?"... Fuck if I know…
Geralt|There's this place in Novigrad they call the Putrid Grove.
Novigrad Beggar 02|Aye, s'bout right. Well, Novigrad's full of nooks and crannies with odd names. Lookin' to sightsee, buy a bloody map.
Geralt|Heard men like you frequent this alley.
Novigrad Beggar 02|And I've heard they fed you horse shit and you smiled and ate it.
Novigrad Beggar 02|Now - don't mean no offense. Go in peace.
Geralt|Changed my mind, actually. Don't need a thing.
Novigrad Beggar 02|Tourists.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Beggar 02|Don't know naught about no grove, putrid or other. Don't generally care much for orchardry.
Geralt|This is urgent.
Novigrad Beggar 02|Leave me be. I don't know.
Geralt|Here.
Geralt|Now you help me. Gotta find the back alley locals call the Putrid Grove. It's important.
Geralt|I'm looking for the Putrid Grove. Need you to help me find it.
Geralt|Farewell.
Novigrad Beggar 02|Aid a veteran of the struggle against the Black Ones?
Geralt|Where'd you fight?
Novigrad Beggar 02|Angren early on. In Cidaris last, along the banks of the Pontar. So, help me out?
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Beggar 03|Alms for the poor?
Geralt|You lame?
Novigrad Beggar 03|No chance! Both legs in perfect order. And me arms - look, like a windmill's wings.
Novigrad Beggar 03|There - see me wavin' 'em? Lookie here. Just look!
Novigrad Beggar 03|And my mind - thorough addled.
Geralt|Been like this long - addled?
Novigrad Beggar 03|Since me mother birthed me.
Novigrad Beggar 03|Here's where it's addled. There. Showin' you with me finger. See that? Me indicatin'!
Geralt|Healthy as a horse as far as I can tell.
Novigrad Beggar 03|Priests have looked, medics, herbalists. All claimed I'm bewildered.
Geralt|Well they're wrong.
Novigrad Beggar 03|Matters little either way. Folk are generous to me. They enjoy watching me point, like this: there, there.
Geralt|You're happy. That's what counts.
Novigrad Beggar 03|I am. When folk ask me the way, I like that most. 'Cause I can point - like this, there, ah! 'Cause I know my way around the city. Oh, do I ever.
Geralt|So you gotta know where the Putrid Grove is, right?
Novigrad Beggar 03|Most certainly do! It's where I live! Over the, uh, there, there, thataway.
Geralt|Thataway, meaning where?
Novigrad Beggar 03|In Lacehalls. There's this alley, past a gate. Not at all putrid and not a grove. Fools call it that, but I know better.
Geralt|And anyone can go there?
Novigrad Beggar 03|O' course. Unless he forgets to say "The old sow's farrowed piglets." Might not let you in, then. But that's easy enough to say. Listen: The old sow's farrowed piglets. See?
Geralt|Thanks for your help.
Geralt|I gotta find the place they call the Putrid Grove.
Novigrad Beggar 03|I know it but won't say. I know it but won't say.
Geralt|Why not?
Novigrad Beggar 03|Not allowed to say. I would tell you, though. If you didn't push, weren't so insistent. If you like, come again. Might tell you then.
Geralt|Guess your mind is truly addled.
Novigrad Beggar 03|Didn't I say so?!
Geralt|So, like I said… I'm looking for the Putrid Grove.
Novigrad Beggar 03|Second time round, your wish is my command! It's thataway, there!
Geralt|Farewell.
Novigrad Beggar 03|Ah… it's you again! Another chat, same as the first? My mind's thorough addled, but the rest of me's fit as a fiddle.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Well, you're not as clever as you think. And I'm not blind. You're on your way to see the King of Beggars.
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|Gonna rob me? Got any ploughing idea what a courier is?
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|This gold is from the nonhumans. Take it and you'll be fucked.
Geralt|I don't want anything from you.
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|Pucker up and kiss my arse.
Geralt|C'mon. We can figure something out.
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|Argh, sod off, poofter.
Geralt|Like you'll be when I let a few people know you pocket some? Not all the nonhuman gold makes it to the King, does it?
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|What the fuck're you on about? I don't pocket a thing.
Geralt|I'm not the one you need to explain this to.
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|All this shite goes to the King. Along with whatever I make.
Geralt|Uh-huh.
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|Actually think Bedlam'll believe you? You're in for a fuckin' surprise. Come on, genius. Can't wait to see what he does to you.
Geralt|Never said I knew where you were going. Just think we're going in the same direction.
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|Then you'd best change yours.
Geralt|Misunderstanding. Sorry.
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|I should bloody well say so.
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|Why the hell're you followin' me?
Geralt|Just happen to be going where you're going.
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|And how the bloody hell d'you know where I'm goin'?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Need you to lead me to the alley they call the Putrid Grove.
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|What the hell d'you think this is? A fuckin' guided outin'? You want to find it, sniff it out yerself, you lazy prick licker.
Geralt|Ugh, listen.
Geralt|I'm a witcher. Don't much like cities. And I downright detest crafty little imps like you and having to chase them.
Geralt|As fate would have it, I gotta go to some shady dive known as the Putrid Grove. Thought I'd just walk around, ask some people, and find it.
Geralt|Turns out that's not how it works.
Geralt|I'm tired, and I'm angry.
Geralt|So if you don't take me there, I'm gonna have to kill you.
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Gulp…!
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Come with me.
Geralt|All right. Wasting my time here.
Geralt|Thought you were someone else.
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Right.
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Walkin', walkin', always behind me walkin'. What the fuck.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|No one.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Grab him!
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Smash the bugger!
Geralt|Me. You have my word.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|A freak's bilgey gas, naught more. How stupid d'you think I am?!
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Grab the whoreson!
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Nosy bugger... Mhm…
Geralt|Yeah, terrible trait.
Geralt|Pokin' around where I probably shouldn't be, I know. But I gotta find the Putrid Grove.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|That's a secret place for secret folk doin' secret business. And who's to say you're any good at keepin' a secret?
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Who are you and what d'you want?
Geralt|Take a look. Whaddaya see?
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Yellow eyes… Pair o' swords… Mutated killer, methinks…
Geralt|Heard this place was a meeting spot for oddities.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Heard right. Know the password - get in free. Don't know it - gotta contribute to the grove's upkeep.
Geralt|Don't know the password.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Pay up, then.
Geralt|Catch.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|You may enter.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Oop. Right after you leave me your weapons. They'll be safe in me locker, here.
Geralt|Fine. Make sure you don't lose them.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|No worries. Be waitin' for you once you're done with the king.
Geralt|Not in the habit of parting with my swords.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|In that case, we must part. Sod off, now.
Geralt|I won't pay. Let me in.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Yes, sir.
Geralt|Might be a problem there.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Then come back once you've solved it.
Geralt|Old sow's farrowed piglets.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Oh… Welcome to the grove, brother.
Geralt|Damned if you do, damned if you don't.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Nope. Not the password.
Geralt|I like to tiptoe through the tulips.
Geralt|Doing some sightseeing. Kinda curious about what's beyond this gate.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Me brother-in-law was curious. Worms been eatin' him for five years now.
Geralt|Farewell…
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|I fare just fine without your wishes. Don't come again!
Geralt|Open up!
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Ah, my old friend, the uh…
<|endoftext|>
King Beggar|I'm actually glad someone like you's found his way to our city. 'Cause it will be our city one day, Geralt. Mark my words.
Geralt|Yours plural?
King Beggar|Yeah, mine… and me friends'.
King Beggar|But that's a tale for another time.
King Beggar|For now, I'll leave you two alone, 'cause I can see… well, you clearly need it.
Triss|Geralt, I have a lot of things to take care of in town.
Geralt|I'll be glad to tag along.
Geralt|Your spies tell you I was looking for the Putrid Grove?
King Beggar|My skull'd be a home for bottom-feedin' river fish if I didn't keep an ear to the ground. And please, "Putrid Grove"? Ugly name for our cozy little hideout, wouldn't you say?
Geralt|Temple Guard tolerate your little operation?
King Beggar|Let's say they appreciate the value of a Novigrad crown.
Geralt|Hm, Menge doesn't seem like the type that can be bought.
King Beggar|Anyone can be bought… but like as true - Menge'd cost me a fortune. Luckily he's got officers, and they're mere mortals.
King Beggar|Illnesses catch 'em at times - other times they wanna catch a bit o' diversion.
King Beggar|See, witcher - I've got plans. Big plans. Far-reaching plans to reshape this city head to toe.
Geralt|Ever thought of seeking a seat on the City Council?
King Beggar|City Council is a puppet troupe with the hierarchy of the Church of the Eternal Fire as its puppeteer. Until recently, that is, when Radovid and his witch hunters took the reins.
King Beggar|The semblance of power don't interest me.
Geralt|A man with a vision.
King Beggar|One day the so-called free city of Novigrad will be truly free. But before that can happen, we gotta rid it of superstition.
King Beggar|Farting around about the hallowed essence of the Eternal Fire - nonsense for kiddies.
Geralt|Apparently not. Cheering crowd at the execution - mostly adults.
King Beggar|Any crowd of rabble'll cheer to the stench of burning flesh. But one day folk'll understand the Eternal Fire's naught but a leash around their necks.
King Beggar|They call this place the Putrid Grove. But it's the rest of Novigrad that's putrefied. This here's the last bastion of normality, sanity, reason.
Geralt|You face the Temple Guard and witch hunters, armed to the teeth. And all you've got's a gang of tramps and a handful of mages. I wouldn't bet a single crown on you.
King Beggar|Nor would I. Not at the moment. But war shuffles the deck. In wartime, folk start to understand things.
King Beggar|Start to wonder why magic's outlawed even though it's so damn useful.
King Beggar|Folk come to me, knowin' full well it's forbidden. You know why? 'Cause they fear death by disease more than torture.
Geralt|So what would you call this dive?
King Beggar|Dunno… The Garden of Liberty, maybe?
Geralt|For a man who shakes down beggars and thieves for tribute, you're quite the romantic.
King Beggar|You say "tribute," I say "taxes." You say "thieves," I say "hard-workin' street clerks."
Geralt|Am I mistaken, or you got something to take up with me?
King Beggar|Who knows… Man with two swords and the skill to use 'em could be very useful these days.
Geralt|Could've sent some underling to fetch me.
King Beggar|Could've. But I admit I wanted to see how you'd manage. See if you're as crafty as you are… well-crafted.
King Beggar|Bout time we made something clear, sorceress.
Triss|Yes. High time.
King Beggar|Me and my men'll manage just fine without the help of you or any other mages, but you - well, without our help you're sitting ducks for the Temple Guard.
King Beggar|Who do I spy...?
Triss|Geralt…?
Geralt|Hey, Triss.
King Beggar|See you two know each other.
King Beggar|See you two know each other well. I was curious whether you'd manage to find me, witcher.
<|endoftext|>
Triss|Nice to hear a few kind words, but my friend needs his weapons.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Course, I got 'em. Said I'd have 'em, give 'em back, so I'm givin' 'em back.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Here's your junk.
Geralt|Thanks.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|You watch out for yourself, miss… Novigrad's not what it used to be, not a city for you.
Triss|I take it you're in Novigrad on important business?
Geralt|Important doesn't do it justice. I'm looking for someone.
Triss|More precisely?
Geralt|Young woman who's like a daughter to me.
Triss|Her?! Here?! No. Impossible.
Geralt|She was here - there're witnesses, evidence. Was hoping you'd heard something.
Geralt|You've been here a while - I need you to help me find something, anything, a trace.
Triss|I'll do everything I can, of course. Who might know more?
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Madame sorceress, beautiful as ever. Damn shame to part.
Triss|Don't fret, bound to be back soon.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Trader 04|Stop… Hear that…? They've come for us.
Eternal Fire Guard 01|The fool didn't break until I began to prick his heels.
Eternal Fire Guard 02|Every man's got his sensitive spots. Interrogated a mage once, pain couldn't touch him. Tore off his fingernails, crushed his bollocks… Nothing.
Eternal Fire Guard 02|Turned out he was devilishly ticklish. I placed a beetle on his belly and set a mug atop it. Damn near went mad.
Triss|Take care of yourself, Kluhg.
Geralt|I can do that. Where'd you toss the package?
Novigrad Trader 04|Near the crane. Second bridge in from the harbor.
Triss|I didn't expect such devotion.
Geralt|Wanted to freshen up anyway. Let's go.
Geralt|Well… some causes require a sacrifice.
Triss|Causes… what about people?
Geralt|For people… same holds true.
Triss|So maybe you'd care to dive in after that sack for me?
Geralt|You win.
Triss|Hello, Kluhg. Manage to get those magic incense ingredients?
Novigrad Trader 04|Yes… somewhat with, uh, difficulties, you might say. I was walking along the canal with a sack full of goodies for you. Looked up and spied a trio of Temple Guards coming the other way.
Triss|Get to the point, Kluhg. No time today for one of your long stories.
Novigrad Trader 04|Wait! A sack full of magicalities and they were coming straight towards me! I don't easily frighten, but, uh, I felt a cold sweat on my arse, I did.
Novigrad Trader 04|I'm afraid I had no choice. I dropped the sack in the water - I had to! When asked why, I claimed it contained a dead cat. You shan't believe this, but they believed me!
Triss|I need that package, Kluhg. I've got a contract.
Novigrad Trader 04|It must be on the canal bed. Luckily it was heavy enough to sink. I'm sure it will turn up if you search.
Triss|You expect me to pay you, then dive for my goods into that ice-cold filth?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Seem to be in your element.
Triss|Still remember my elements, how I use them?
Geralt|Come on, six months isn't that long. And it's not like I'm senile.
Triss|But you do have a history of amnesia.
Geralt|I've recovered my memory, completely.
Triss|Good. That should stop people from taking advantage of you.
Geralt|Someone's been taken advantage of me?
Triss|I have, for one.
Geralt|I've never even intimated--
Triss|We need to hurry.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Greetings, sorceress.
Triss|Greetings, Brandon.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|I didn't expect you to bring company.
Geralt|Is that a problem?
Novigrad Rich Man 01|By the Eternal Fire, no! I'm surprised, that's all.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Together I expect you'll resolve things twice as fast. You've the look of true experts.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|But I'd prefer you not to tarry and begin.
Geralt|Triss, you and Brandon here - you've agreed a price?
Triss|We settled on a full coin purse.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Brandon and Co. is a serious outfit. We've the largest granary in all Novigrad.
Geralt|All right, then… Let's get to work.
Triss|We need to place these crystals around the granary. Near anything that looks rat-related.
Geralt|Don't much like merchants who flatter with cheap praise before the job's done.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|That was not cheap praise! I was merely stating a fact.
Geralt|So am I.
Geralt|I want you to pay in full in advance.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|I'm afraid that's impossible.
Geralt|Then trap your own rats.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Well, now I know why she brought you along. Fine. A full purse of Novigrad crowns. As proof of my good will.
Geralt|You're a merchant, familiar with how commerce works.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Of course. Honest pay for honest work.
Geralt|Half up front, half once the job's done.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|You're asking a great deal.
Geralt|I'm a witcher. Gotta admit I've met my share of people who say one thing beforehand, another after the fact.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Hm, very well. Your first installment.
Geralt|Triss, you told this man you're a sorceress?
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Of course. She was looking for work - that's her chief asset.
Geralt|Are you Triss?
Triss|I know it was reckless, but competition's stiff here. No one would hire me if I claimed to be a common rat catcher.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|More importantly no one would believe such a beauty could be an exterminator of rodents.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Knew a man once who reacted to everything, especially adversity, by mocking it.
Triss|Healthy attitude. Must've lived long.
Geralt|Came a day he lost both his legs in battle. He shrugged, said it was better that way - he'd never feel pain in them again.
Triss|I understand him perfectly.
Geralt|I know. Thing is, he was lying to himself.
Triss|I think he just didn't have much of a choice…
Geralt|We all lie sometimes. But lying to yourself is running away, whereas there's really nowhere to run.
Triss|Sometimes you have to escape just to forget. Your friend might've dwelled on his lost legs. But it's not like by grieving he could've grown another pair.
Triss|So, tell me how Yen's doing?
Geralt|How do you know I found her?
Triss|You didn't answer my question. How's Yen?
Geralt|She's fine.
Triss|That's good.
Geralt|Asking about anything specific?
Triss|Never mind. I got my answer.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Well, well… Our lovebirds having themselves a little chat instead of working?
Triss|The job's done.
Triss|Geralt, those are--
Geralt|I know who they are, Triss.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|My friends… begged me to notify them if I encountered a mage, sorceress, what have you. Didn't have the heart to refuse…
Triss|It's a trap, Geralt.
Geralt|This stank from the start.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Such a sharp sense of smell, you should've legged it while you had the chance.
Geralt|I don't generally leg it. Here's what I think you should do. Pay up and march your boys outta here. While there's still time.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Don't be ridiculous. I didn't hire a sorceress in order to pay her.
Witch Hunter 01|Take my advice, mutant. If it's not your business, stay out of it.
Geralt|Thanks for the advice, but… I can't take it.
Geralt|All right. We've talked. Do what you gotta. Just remember… I can't help but get in your way.
Witch Hunter 01|Heard enough from this whoreson.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|As have I. Neither is to leave here alive.
Geralt|Let's agree your friends were never here. Now pay the rest and let's part in peace.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|You don't set the terms, mutant.
Witch Hunter 01|Stay out of it. We're here for the witch.
Geralt|We're inseparable, see? Afraid you'll have to take us both.
Triss|Geralt!
Witch Hunter 01|If you say so…
Geralt|If these boys are here to help us kill rats, they're late. You paid up front and got what you paid for. Not half a rodent left in the granary.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|I paid in advance because I knew I'd recover my coin.
Triss|Such is life for sorceresses in Novigrad these days.
Geralt|I can see that and I don't like it. So here's what I think: the hunters have come, and now can they go.
Witch Hunter 01|They'll do no such thing.
Geralt|Not bad…
Geralt|Don't know yet.
Geralt|You could be right. But only he knows the truth…
Triss|We're only ever the ones to know the truth about ourselves.
Geralt|Which we share at times with those we hold dear.
Triss|Even if it's hard to swallow?
Geralt|Even then.
Triss|Who knows… maybe one day…
Geralt|I was worried about seeing you again. Doubted it could be pleasant…
Triss|We said everything there was to say six months ago. I don't want to go back to that.
Geralt|I'm not going back to it. It's just… It's one thing to say something, it's another to actually do it.
Triss|We promised to remain friends. I hope nothing'll change that.
Triss|Now we wait for them to scurry away.
Geralt|Interesting method. Never had much luck with rats.
Geralt|Once, I hit one with a fork in complete darkness. Trying to show off my witcher senses…
Geralt|Masterful throw, really. Problem was no one else saw it - how could they in the dark?
Triss|Hahah. So, what do you think? Rat catcher? It's a long way to fall from being advisor to Temeria's king.
Geralt|I'm just glad to see you safe and sound, and…
Triss|Reconciled…?
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Don't kill me! Good sir, no… They forced me… Had I not told them, they'd have set fire to my home, my warehouse… The mage hunters know no mercy…
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Spare me, good man… Be not like those murderers.
Geralt|Shut up. I should kill you. Thing is, you'd be no good to anyone but the gulls as a corpse. So you'll live and pay us double. Now.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Ff…. Fine… Your coin…
Geralt|Now get!
Triss|Thanks, Geralt.
Geralt|You should try to keep better company.
Triss|He was still better than some mages.
Triss|You know, I've been thinking… who might know something about Ciri. And I just got an idea.
Triss|There's an oneiromancer in town - Corinne Tilly. Very capable, supposedly.
Geralt|Never trusted in dreamers' abilities myself.
Triss|Corinne's been very effective - you should at least try.
Triss|She's taken a job close by. Follow the canal, away from the fish market. The house is near the first bridge. Its owner, de Jonkheer, is a rich banker.
Geralt|Not coming with me?
Triss|I've got some things to care of.
Geralt|Another rat-infested warehouse?
Triss|Not exactly. Nothing even remotely satisfying. Such are the times.
Geralt|It was nice to see you again.
Triss|You too, Geralt.
Triss|You should go now, before Corinne goes back into hiding somewhere.
Geralt|What if I want to find you?
Triss|I live in the Bits, near the fish market. Stop by. It'd be nice.
Geralt|All right - see you later.
Geralt|Thanks for everything. See you, Triss.
Triss|Mhm. See you.
Geralt|How do I find you if I need you…?
Triss|I live in the Bits. Head up the hill past the fish market. Stop by.
Geralt|Be seeing you.
Geralt|No need. Glad I could help.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Just passing by, wanderer, or do you seek something specific?
Geralt|Who's asking?
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Rudolf de Jonkheer.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Of those de Jonkheers, yes. My ancestors laid the foundations of this city. I now own its largest bank.
Geralt|Didn't need a recommendation. Name would've been enough.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Father always said: "All ought to know your merits, son. Don't hide them under a bushel."
Geralt|I'm looking for Corinne Tilly.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|You've come to the right place, then. Corinne is inside… Been there for a few days, dreaming the home's history.
Geralt|I'd like to go inside, look around.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|I don't usually let strangers rummage around my home. Twin swords, though… you're a witcher. You may enter - call that my whim.
Geralt|Why do you need to know the house's history? You a historian, or on a whim?
Novigrad Rich Man 03|I bought this property a short while ago - paid a pretty penny, I might add. Soon after, I witnessed… disturbances. Led me to fear the home might be haunted.
Geralt|What're the symptoms?
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Oh, they vary. Giggling… in the night. And furniture moving about in the attic, and last week… well, you shan't believe it - I found human feces in the parlor.
Geralt|Not interested in what's going on inside? Seeing it for yourself?
Novigrad Rich Man 03|I'm a banker. Cursed homes scare me - do you know how a haunting can affect property value? Point of fact, Corinne requested she not be disturbed.
Geralt|So long.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|You seem drawn to this place, wanderer.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Well, witcher? What have you learned? More importantly, what have you resolved?
Geralt|Something or someone's playing hide and seek with me in there. Left signs showing where to go, what to do. I'll try to figure out what's going on. And who it is.
Geralt|The house isn't cursed, just has a tenant - a godling.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|What the devil is a godling?
Geralt|Post-Conjunction creature. Likes making mischief.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|"Mischief," you call it, yet it's likely to prevent me from selling.
Geralt|I can try to smoke it out. I'll need burdock.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|How did you fare? Learn anything?
Novigrad Rich Man 03|I saw Miss Corinne leave, but she refused to speak to me. Is the matter resolved? Or quite the opposite?
Geralt|Burned some burdock in the stove. Godling couldn't stand the smell and fled. And Corinne simply… awoke. Anyway, house is clean.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Excellent! I must admit the experience has put me off the building - I shan't keep it. I'm mindful of the reward I owe you and you'll receive a sizeable commission. As soon as I'm… I'm able to sell the house.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Come by from time to time and ask. The de Jonkheers never break their word once given.
Geralt|Thanks.
Geralt|A bit of both. A demon had captured Corinne. I managed to free her, but the house is still haunted.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Did Corinne dream of the building's past?
Geralt|Yeah… Pretty horrid, apparently, though she refused to talk about it. Nobody should inhabit the place.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|So many crowns, I paid… Ah, well… It shan't put me in the poorhouse.
Geralt|Got a godling in your house. Name's Sarah and she's an ornery little thing. Left her alone but thought I should tell you about her.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|I thank you for being candid. Could you rid me of this beast?
Geralt|You can do it yourself. Just burn some burdock in the oven. She's sure to run, godlings detest the smoke.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|I will not wage war on a beast, large or small. Piss on the godling, piss on the house. I must merely find a fool willing to buy it.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Your burdock. Will that do?
Geralt|That's plenty, thanks.
<|endoftext|>
Godling Sara|Boo!
Godling Sara|Did I scare you?
Godling Sara|Scared you, didn't I? Can tell you was scared. A big brave man scared of wee little Sarah. Ain't that funny!
Geralt|I wouldn't do that anymore if I were you, Sarah. You might scare someone so bad they'll hurt you.
Godling Sara|Why would someone hurt me? Havin' a spot of fun's not allowed anymore?
Geralt|What're you playing?
Godling Sara|That lady fell asleep, and I've sent her some horrible dreams. I'll not her wake, neither. I can do that, you know. Funny, isn't it?
Geralt|Very funny. Thing is, I gotta talk to the dreamer, so I'd like you to let her wake up.
Godling Sara|Little Sarah doesn't want her to wake. Little Sarah wants to play.
Geralt|You're lucky. I know you're a harmless godling. But others might not know, and then…
Godling Sara|And how d'you know I'm a godling, eh? How's that, eh? Eh?
Geralt|If it looks like one and acts like one… Trust me, you're a godling.
Geralt|You give the dreamer nightmares, and won't let her wake up. Why are you tormenting her?
Godling Sara|I'm not tormenting anyone. Scary dreams are great. What I love is when this big 'en chases me. Hen's got these red…
Geralt|Why do you live in a haunted house?
Godling Sara|Tell you a secret. The house ain't haunted, not one bit! I just pretend it is, make everyone think that. It was sittin' there all empty, so I moved in.
Godling Sara|Bigwig from the bank then came and bought it. I don't like bankers, 'specially not to live with, so I decided to give 'im a scare.
Geralt|Gave the banker a really big scare. See, he paid a lot for this house and won't give it up easily. Which is why you need to find another home.
Godling Sara|I don't want to! I don't! I won't!
Geralt|Sarah, Novigrad's no place for a godling, but if you want to live here, that's your business. So let's make a deal.
Godling Sara|A deal? What kind?
Geralt|Leave the dreamer alone. In exchange, I'll tell the banker the house is haunted - for good, no way to lift the curse.
Godling Sara|You'd tell him that? What if he doesn't believe you?
Geralt|I'm a witcher. He'll believe me.
Godling Sara|Yes, yes, yes! Do that and I promise not to bother your friend. Not even a little. You're awfully nice, you know?
Geralt|I don't hear that often. Thanks.
Godling Sara|Now go wake that sleepyhead. I won't stop her, she'll get up.
Geralt|See now, wanna do this the nice way, but you just won't let me…
Godling Sara|What'll you do to me, eh? Eh? Eh?
Geralt|Burdock - godlings hate the scent. How would you like a whiff?
Godling Sara|You're stupid and a pig!
Geralt|The way you play, well, it's only ever fun for you.
Godling Sara|That's 'cause you're a dullard. All you humans are dullards!

Dreamer Corine Tilly|Who are you?
Geralt|Triss Merigold sent me to see you...
Dreamer Corine Tilly|Gods… Horrible nightmares. I was supposed to dream the history of this house… Instead, I saw furniture, hungry furniture that wished to devour me…
Dreamer Corine Tilly|I know it must sound foolish, but in the dream - well, it was all too real… and not at all amusing.
Geralt|The work of a godling. She made people believe the house was haunted. Also injected your dreams with her little jokes.
Dreamer Corine Tilly|And you managed to wake me? I feel fortunate.
Geralt|We witchers have our ways.
Dreamer Corine Tilly|I thank you. Very much. The dreams, they were awful. Any way I can pay you back?
Geralt|There is, actually. I'm looking for a young woman who was seen in Novigrad.
Dreamer Corine Tilly|I can certainly try to help. But I'll need to clear my head first. After those deranged dreams, I feel it's full of cobwebs. Find me at the Golden Sturgeon. I rent a room there.
Geralt|All right. See you there.
Geralt|I told Sarah… I mean, the godling… Told her Novigrad's no place for godlings and creatures like them.
<|endoftext|>
Dreamer Corine Tilly|I dream in here.
Geralt|Never witnessed a séance like this before. Let alone participated.
Dreamer Corine Tilly|I will guide you. We must first achieve a kind of mental accord: I must ask some questions, you must answer them. It's important you're truthful, answer from your heart.
Geralt|Let's begin.
Dreamer Corine Tilly|To start with, tell me a memory you have of this woman.
Geralt|What for?
Dreamer Corine Tilly|Do as I ask, please. I need the strongest, most complete memory you have of…
Geralt|Ciri. The woman's name is Ciri.
Geralt|Let's continue, please?
Dreamer Corine Tilly|You claim the woman has… abilities. Tell me about them.
Dreamer Corine Tilly|Make yourself comfortable and try to relax.
Dreamer Corine Tilly|You must take my hand and talk of Ciri. Tell me where you think she might be, who could be at her side.
Geralt|Mhm… If Ciri couldn't find me, I'm sure she would've looked for another friend.
Dreamer Corine Tilly|Who do you mean?
Geralt|Maybe Dandelion? They liked each other a lot…
Geralt|Ugh. Dreamt of a swallow at first… After that, just nightmares.
Dreamer Corine Tilly|At times the dreams can multiply. Show the past as well as the future.
Geralt|The swallow - it symbolizes Ciri. She contacted Dandelion. I didn't know he was in town…
Dreamer Corine Tilly|The poet? Heard about him. Someone left him the Rosemary and Thyme in their will.
Geralt|Thanks for your help.
Dreamer Corine Tilly|Good luck, witcher. I hope you find your Ciri.
Geralt|The Rosemary and Thyme? Where's that?
Dreamer Corine Tilly|As you enter the city through the red light district, you come upon a bridge. The Rosemary is just past it.
Geralt|Dandelion inherited a brothel?
Dreamer Corine Tilly|So I've heard.
Geralt|Yennefer wasn't in Novigrad…
Geralt|Triss was, but Ciri never found her…
Geralt|She's a child of the Elder Blood.
Dreamer Corine Tilly|A descendent of Bloody Falka? The rebel burned at the stake?
Dreamer Corine Tilly|The prophecies claim the world's destroyer will be born of the firebrand's cursed blood.
Geralt|Pure legend.
Dreamer Corine Tilly|Know when a legend transforms into prophecy? When it gains believers. I think you're right to be reticent in talking about the woman.
Dreamer Corine Tilly|I see. Do you wish to say more?
Geralt|Yeah, there's something else.
Geralt|No. Can we start?
Dreamer Corine Tilly|Naturally.
Dreamer Corine Tilly|I knew you cared about her. But your tone, the emotions you so carefully conceal…
Geralt|They call Ciri the Lady of Space and Time. Once I asked Yennefer why.
Geralt|She… travels between worlds… Hm, turns out I don't know how to talk about it.
Geralt|Didn't really understand much of what Yen told me.
Geralt|I just know there's more to it than traveling to different places.
Geralt|And that Ciri carries immense power in her blood.
Geralt|I remember Ciri having trouble controlling her abilities.
Geralt|Yennefer tried to teach her to cast simple spells, and Ciri destroyed a shed near the temple where they were. Really upset her, but it was just an old shed.
Geralt|I know it took her a while to gain control. And frankly, I doubt she controls her abilities fully to this day.
Geralt|I accepted a job once, did it. Asked to choose my reward, I invoked the Law of Surprise.
Geralt|Never thought I'd actually meet the child promised to me at that time.
Geralt|Years later I was in the Brokilon Forest. Happened on a girl there. Didn't know who she was.
Geralt|The dryads wanted to keep her, turn her into one of their own. But the Waters of Oblivion - they failed in her case.
Geralt|Ciri came out of Brokilon with me. I sent her back to her grandmother then… But already I felt bound to her…
Dreamer Corine Tilly|By Destiny?
Geralt|By something more.
Dreamer Corine Tilly|Thank you.
Dreamer Corine Tilly|Would you be willing to share another memory?
Geralt|No. Let's continue.
Geralt|Yes.
Dreamer Corine Tilly|No need to rush. We have time.
Geralt|Ciri was orphaned. During the second war with Nilfgaard.
Geralt|Had no idea what to do with a young girl, so I did what I would've done with a boy and took her to Kaer Morhen. Figured some physical training, sword work, development of her stamina - couldn't hurt.
Geralt|I remember her standing on a crumbling wall. A stone came loose, she lost her footing… Caught her at the last possible instant.
Geralt|Strongest memory, though, is of her coming out of her room one day, wearing a dress and claiming she was indisposed.
Geralt|Knew then that Ciri was maturing, it was unavoidable. I was lost in the face of that.
Dreamer Corine Tilly|I see… Do you wish to tell me anything more?
Geralt|Yes… I think so.
Dreamer Corine Tilly|In that case, I'm listening.
Geralt|It was after her time training at Kaer Morhen. After the moment when Yennefer first called Ciri her daughter.
Geralt|We'd been separated. I knew she was in danger - I'd dreamt of her, multiple times.
Geralt|I found her at Stygga Castle. She'd gone there to free Yen and gotten herself captured in the process.
Geralt|They wanted to hurt her.
Geralt|I remember fighting side by side with Ciri on stairs slippery from blood.
Geralt|It was the first time she ever deflected a crossbow bolt with her sword. Told her never to try it again.
Dreamer Corine Tilly|These memories, they're intense. Do you wish to continue?
Geralt|I have more to say.
Dreamer Corine Tilly|Then please do.
Geralt|It was in Rivia. The second war with Nilfgaard had just ended.
Geralt|There was still tension in the air. For gods know what reason, race riots erupted in the town.
Geralt|I tried to do something, but… Couldn't stop a riled crowd.
Geralt|A boy with a pitchfork. He ran it right through my gut. Yennefer lay dying as well…
Geralt|Ciri had us carried onto a boat… We sailed to a place where apple trees bloom eternal. She left us there.
Geralt|It was the last time I saw her.
Dreamer Corine Tilly|Is there anything you'd like to add? Another memory, perhaps?
Geralt|Yes… There's something else…
Dreamer Corine Tilly|All right. Tell me no more than you wish to.
Geralt|Your gift - tell me how it works?
Dreamer Corine Tilly|It's hard to describe… To start with, I must gain an understanding of the bond between the person and the object I'm to dream about.
Dreamer Corine Tilly|I ask questions, try to flesh out feelings, emotions… Truth is essential in this, and though most who come to me acknowledge that, many refuse to speak openly of certain matters. Apart from which they remain unaware of others, further obscuring things.
Geralt|What do you see in your dreams?
Dreamer Corine Tilly|I don't. It's my client who sees. My gift lies in summoning the right dreams.
Dreamer Corine Tilly|At times, nightmares or strong desires impose themselves on true events. It takes skill to separate seed from chaff.
Dreamer Corine Tilly|Speak, please…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Lookin' for Roche.
Temerian Bandit 03|No one here by that name.
Temerian Bandit 03|Anythin' else?
Geralt|I see. And behind you - that's a berry pickers' camp?
Temerian Bandit 03|We're, uh… birdwatchers.
Geralt|Lemme guess: that sword's in case you run into a hornbill?
Temerian Bandit 03|No. Hornbills aren't endemic to this area. Don't migrate here, either.
Roche|You blind, Hortensio? That's Geralt, old friend of mine.
Roche|Come in, Geralt.
Geralt|Gonna walk in the camp now.
Temerian Bandit 03|Aye, naturally.
Geralt|And you're gonna go look for hornbills.
Temerian Bandit 03|Aye, I'm goin', indeed.
Geralt|I get it. You're the local funny man.
Temerian Bandit 03|What was that?
Temerian Bandit 03|Funny? How you mean that?
Geralt|Move.
Temerian Bandit 03|No, sorry. We talked, it was amusin', now about face and forward march.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Bloody mess.
Dwarf Man 01|Just… sorta happened.
Dwarf Man 01|Came here, polite and all, to invite Whoreson Junior to a get-together with his mates. Became obvious right quick that none here acknowledged the ancient rite of hospitality.
Geralt|You in charge here?
Dwarf Man 01|What's it to you?
Geralt|Looking for Junior.
Dwarf Man 01|Argh. Welcome to the Whoreson Hunters' Club. Alas, we're fresh out of membership cards. And you're outta luck far as Junior goes - bugger's not here.
Geralt|Know where I can find him?
Dwarf Man 01|No.
Geralt|I'm gonna take a look around.
Dwarf Man 01|Got my eye on you.
Dwarf Man 01|Workin' here. Stop proddin' me arse like you're lookin' to poke it.
Dwarf Man 01|Lingerin', lingerin' like a fart in me dad-in-law's pants!
Geralt|Greetings.
Dwarf Man 01|Ach, you're Reuven's mate, aren't you. Heard of you.
<|endoftext|>
Eunuch Happen|If I might be allowed a comment, sir - it's not commonly accepted in this city to stroll about nude.
Eunuch Happen|I 'd advise you to don some clothing.
Geralt|Anybody there?! Open up!
Eunuch Happen|What's the fuss? The bathhouse is closed.
Geralt|Need to talk to the owner. I know he's here.
Eunuch Happen|I'm not sure that matters, as he's terribly busy.
Geralt|Tell him Geralt of Rivia wants to talk to him.
Eunuch Happen|I cannot promise Mr. Reuven will have time to see you.
Geralt|Wanna bet?
Eunuch Happen|Teeheehee. Very well, I shall try. Please wait.
Eunuch Happen|Sigi Reuven cordially invites you to join him. I'm Happen.
Eunuch Happen|The meeting is in the baths. We will pass through the dressing room, so you can leave your clothes.
Geralt|Let's go.
Geralt|Busy? With what?
Eunuch Happen|Entertaining important guests.
Geralt|In that case, tell him there's another one at the door. Geralt of Rivia. And I'm not leaving till I see him.
Eunuch Happen|You may disrobe here. Your equipment will be safe.
Eunuch Happen|Splendid. Sigi Reuven awaits in the next room.

Dijkstra|Easy, Cleaver…
Karl Varese|Whoreson Junior's a dead man. I'll have my scribe send you a notice.
King Beggar|You don't have a scribe. And we'll eliminate Junior when, and only when, all of us say "aye."
King Beggar|Reuven - your guest.
Karl Varese|Why the fuck you let him in here?
Dijkstra|Because I want to talk to him. This is Geralt of Rivia.
King Beggar|Good to see you again.
Karl Varese|As always I'm out of the swivin' loop. Who the fuck are you?
Geralt|Think I'll let your host introduce me.
Dijkstra|He's a witcher. The very one who first foiled an attempt on Foltest's life and then killed that monarch.
Geralt|Allegedly. But I didn't kill Foltest. And hello to you, too, Dijkstra… Reuven - whatever they call you these days.
Dijkstra|Last we met, Geralt thrashed me silly and crushed my ankle. I really wonder what he's got in store this time.
Geralt|Got intruders. Someone just snuck inside the bathhouse. Several men…
Karl Varese|What the fuck's he on about? Ploughin' fortuneteller.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|Assassins!
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|Please, no!
Novigrad Prostitute 01|Aaaaaa-!
Karl Varese|Bloody hell, I fucking knew it!
King Beggar|Any weapons tucked away?
Dijkstra|Just a few.
Karl Varese|First ever barney with my prick hangin' out. Harrr!
Geralt|I'm a witcher.
Karl Varese|Problems with your plumbing?
Dijkstra|Nah. It's under control. Geralt's a friend from the old days. Although…
Geralt|Got something to discuss with Dijkstra… I mean, Sigi Reuven.
Karl Varese|I think it can wait.
Geralt|Yeah, probably can.
Geralt|None of your business.
Karl Varese|Your friend got a death wish?
Dijkstra|Heheheh, nah, just short on manners. Witchers aren't exactly the sophisticated urban types.
Karl Varese|Fuckin' talked enough. We're wastin' time, and this is a simple matter.
Karl Varese|Whoreson got an invite, chose not to come. I'll show you what he thinks of us.
<|endoftext|>
Karl Varese|Good work, gents.
Dijkstra|Terribly sorry for that incident. My security failed. I'll get to the bottom of who, why and how.
Karl Varese|They were Whoreson's scum. That's the bottom of who and how right there.
King Beggar|Don't start that again. Especially not in front of our guest.
Karl Varese|Who pranced in right before they attacked. Coincidence? Why do I doubt it?
Dijkstra|Let's give him a chance to explain.
Geralt|I'm looking for Whoreson Junior.
King Beggar|Interesting.
Karl Varese|What do you want with him?
Geralt|It's personal.
Dijkstra|Hahaha, Geralt takes his privacy very seriously. Spyin' on him, havin' him followed, was a bloody nightmare.
King Beggar|Still, uh, he was lots more trusting when he was looking for Merigold.
Karl Varese|Gentleman, you out of your fucking minds? A chat session? Whoreson's out to get us, and he'll succeed, eventually. We've got to kill him first.
Karl Varese|So by all means, you sit here, soak, fart and watch the bubbles rise, while I send my boys to Whoreson's hidey-holes. They'll make some noise, flush the bugger out.
Karl Varese|And you, Geriatric, or whatever your ploughin' name is - wanna find Whoreson? Find me first.
Geralt|Any clue on Junior's whereabouts? Be grateful for any lead.
King Beggar|Sigi?
Dijkstra|It's worth a try. Geralt's got a knack for finding people. And he's discreet - a value in itself.
King Beggar|Leave you to it, then.
Dijkstra|I'll, uh, look in on you tomorrow, Francis. Finish our talk.
Geralt|So, how about we get dressed?
Dijkstra|Sure, sure - then we'll talk. In private.
Geralt|I need to find Whoreson. Now looks like I gotta get to him before Cleaver does.
Dijkstra|Cleaver won't find him easy. Junior's good at hiding. He's got… peasant smarts.
King Beggar|Look at the time. Good luck in your search, witcher.
Dijkstra|I'll call on you tomorrow, Francis. We'll finish our chat.
Geralt|Junior's gonna help me find someone.
King Beggar|Whoreson's not helped a soul in all his miserable life.
Geralt|I'll ask him nicely.
Dijkstra|See, Cleaver? Perhaps if you'd not called Junior an uncle-fucker and "asked him nicely," he'd 'ave showed up today.
Geralt|Not gonna introduce me to your friends?
Dijkstra|Good thing Happen's not here. He'd tan the hide on my arse for being so rude.
Dijkstra|Francis Bedlam you know, but then, who's not heard of this patron of the fine arts and supporter of entrepreneurs of limited initial means.
Dijkstra|And the dwarf's Carlo Varese, known also as Cleaver. Carlo's in entertainment, mostly.
Geralt|How are you… Reuven? Disappeared for a few years there, only to reappear here in Novigrad…?
Dijkstra|Oh, I've been here, there. Spent some time in Zerrikania, matter of fact.
Geralt|Hm. What'd you do in the desert?
Dijkstra|Sought oneness with nature. Magical place, really.
Dijkstra|But, I missed civilization, so I'm back. Aim to plant roots in Novigrad, become a respected citizen. And who knows, someday maybe even a town councilor.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Help me find Junior?
Karl Varese|I'm about to send my lads around Whoreson's hideouts. Won't say no to a witcher's blade.
Karl Varese|Lead my men, take the war to Junior, and drag him out of his hidey-hole. Win-win situation, as I see it.
Geralt|All right.
Karl Varese|Now, I suspect Junior's hidin' at his casino in Gildorf. Either that or near the arena beneath the Bits. My lads'll be there.
Karl Varese|Find him.
Geralt|Not interested in your squabbles.
Karl Varese|You figure out what you want, come and see me.
Geralt|Whoreson can't die until I've talked to him.
Karl Varese|My lads're hot-headed and I like 'em like that. Want to rein them in? Do so on your own.
Karl Varese|Change of heart?
Karl Varese|With or without you, I will hang Whoreson's stones out to dry. Joinin' forces just seems reasonable.
Novigrad Peasant 01|Don't know nothin' about no heist! I was off, then - at the brothel all the night!
Karl Varese|A wee minute, witcher.
Karl Varese|Now I'm curious somethin' mighty… How is it you were off the same bloody night Whoreson tried to kill me?
Novigrad Peasant 01|Twas chance, honest! I was at the brothel! I've witnesses!
Karl Varese|I don't doubt you've found some witnesses, but I do doubt the bit about… chance.
Karl Varese|Know what? Shite conversation, this. So much bletherin'. We've got nowhere.
Karl Varese|Lads, you have a chat with him. It's simple - I wanna know where Whoreson is.
Novigrad Peasant 01|I've not betrayed you! Not ever!
Novigrad Peasant 01|No! No! I know nothin'!
Geralt|Greetings.
Karl Varese|What brings you here?
Geralt|Already looking for Junior on my own.
Karl Varese|Shame you didn't come see me first. I'd 'ave helped you.
Geralt|Your search for Junior - any luck?
Karl Varese|Tomorrow at the latest, the bugger'll be pushin' up daisies.
Karl Varese|Care to join the hunt?
<|endoftext|>
Dwarf Man 01|We're set to go. Anytime.
Dwarf Man 01|On your mark, we rush in.
Dwarf Man 01|High time we taught Whoreson who's boss.
Geralt|Let's go, then.
Dwarf Man 01|Pfft.
Geralt|Wait for it.
Dwarf Man 01|Not too long, eh?
Geralt|Ready?
Dwarf Man 01|Righto. We go on your mark.
Geralt|Waiting for me?
Dwarf Man 01|Och aye, guv. Cleaver sent us over to help. On your mark, we go in and gut the buggers.
Geralt|No buggers left to gut. Took care of 'em on my own.
Dwarf Man 01|Bugger me! All on your own?
Dwarf Man 01|Hear that?! Nowt for us here! Off we go!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Greetings.
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|Don't know you. Not lettin' you in. And don't you fucking stand there.
Geralt|Recognize this piece of paper?
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|A fight contract.
Geralt|Good, you can read. So who's this contract made out to?
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|Says, uh, Zdenek. Made out to Zdenek.
Geralt|Mhm. I'm Zdenek. Any more questions?
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|In you go.
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|Don't you go wanderin'. Straight to Igor, now.
Geralt|Fair enough.
Geralt|Sure we can't work this out?
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|How's that?
Geralt|I pay you, you let me in.
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|Give it here.
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|Get in. And remember, we've an eye on you.
Geralt|Who runs the fights?
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Igor.
Geralt|I want my chance in the arena.
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|Come in.
Geralt|Who's in charge?
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|Igor. They call him Hook.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|What the bloody hell was that?
Geralt|A bout of sudden sincerity.
Geralt|Love to chat it up with doormen. In fact, often come to an agreement with them.
Geralt|Thing is, I'm short on patience today. So either let me in, or I'll let myself in, over your dead bodies.
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|Oooh, hear the cockerel? Kickin' and standin' his comb on edge…
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Cock a doodle do, what am I to do? Shit myself?
Geralt|All right…
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|Go left!
Geralt|Fair enough.
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|Oi! Beat it!
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|Oy! I'm talkin' to you! Y'understand human?! Get. The. Fuck. Out!
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|No passage. Don't linger, neither.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Gettin' on me nerves, you gray-haired knob. Piss off.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|You heard? They raided Cleaver's house.
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|They kill him?
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Don't be daft. Cleaver weren't born yesterday. War's on. Bugger kips down somewhere new every night.
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|Hmph. Whoreson's in for it now. Cleaver's spiteful - won't let it slide.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Whoreson gets ploughed up the arse, we'll be next, you know.
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|We had peace, peace was good. Who found it a fuckin' bother?

Geralt|I need work.
Novigrad Old Man 01|What can you do?
Geralt|Good with a sword. Wouldn't scoff at working as protection.
Novigrad Old Man 01|And who here would you protect?
Geralt|Whoreson Junior's made a load of enemies, I know that much. Maybe I can be of use.
Novigrad Old Man 01|Junior can take care of himself, you needn't fret about him.
Novigrad Old Man 01|But I can't help wonder how you know this place belongs to him.
Geralt|Heard it does, that's all.
Novigrad Old Man 01|Forget you heard of Junior, keep healthy. That's my advice.
Geralt|Not your hireling. Won't take your orders, don't need your advice.
Novigrad Old Man 01|You're not my hireling, that's true. But soooo uppity, afraid you need to die. Kill him!
Geralt|Fine. All in all, don't really care who I'm gonna protect. Just looking for work.
Geralt|Crowds can spin out of control. Somebody's gotta keep the peace.
Novigrad Old Man 01|Hm…
Novigrad Old Man 01|Claim any kind of experience?
Geralt|I'm a witcher. I kill monsters for coin. Been doing it all my life. Humans won't be a problem.
Novigrad Old Man 01|A guard must fight sometimes. But that's not most important.
Novigrad Old Man 01|The essential question is, can you control yourself? And can you control a crowd?
Geralt|Been taught how to slow down or speed up my heart rate, how to dilate my pupils and alter my metabolism.
Geralt|My medallion vibrates when danger's near, and I know a few simple spells.
Novigrad Old Man 01|Hmm… I'll have to test you. I want to see how you manage in a fight, if you can fight at all.
Novigrad Old Man 01|You shall fight in the arena. Survive three bouts, and I'll put you to work.
Geralt|Set me up.
Novigrad Old Man 01|Already have.
Novigrad Old Man 01|Shall we start right away, or do you need time to prepare?
Geralt|Always prepared.
Novigrad Old Man 01|Excellent! Let's see what you're worth.
Novigrad Old Man 01|Remember, you fight to the death. The crowd doesn’t take kindly to those who spare their foes.
Geralt|Let's do this.
Geralt|Need a moment to get ready.
Novigrad Old Man 01|Don't keep me waiting.
Geralt|Not about to slaughter people I don't even know.
Novigrad Old Man 01|No work in protection until I've made sure you are who you say you are. You know where to find me should you change your mind.
Geralt|Done my share of fighting. Wouldn't carry a sword if I didn't know how to use it.
Novigrad Old Man 01|Have you killed humans?
Geralt|Sometimes.
Novigrad Old Man 01|Why not come out and say you're a witcher? It's plain to see.
Geralt|Not looking for any monster contracts. Need a regular job. For a while.
Novigrad Old Man 01|So, decided yet? Willing to test your mettle in the arena?
Novigrad Old Man 01|Ready? Wish to enter the arena?
<|endoftext|>
Cyprian Willey|Bravo! Ploughin' scragged 'em up thorough.
Cyprian Willey|They told me a true bruiser'd come to the arena. Would you believe it? They were right!
Geralt|Thanks. I'd like to know who's congratulating me.
Cyprian Willey|Heheh, slow, ain't ya?
Cyprian Willey|Came here to end me, and you've no notion what I look like?
Cyprian Willey|Well, we've nattered enough. Now--
Novigrad Old Man 01|Cleaver's dwarves are in the sewers! They've slaughtered the guards!
Cyprian Willey|Don't stand there like a soddin' prick at a wedding! Muster the men and get at those midgets!
Cyprian Willey|And would someone please kill the blasted witcher?
Novigrad Old Man 01|You heard the man. Kill him!
Geralt|Thanks.
Cyprian Willey|Cyprian Wily, known to most as Whoreson Junior, appreciates good handiwork.

Novigrad Thug Weak 01|Why you even here?
Geralt|Same reason anyone comes here. Play a bit, have a good time.
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|Invite only, mate. Shit out of luck.
Geralt|Think we can make a deal?
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|Hear that? Another one.
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|No, we don't make deals.
Geralt|How much?
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|Oy. Remember what I told you. We're to be polite-like.
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Just my patience - runnin' a bit thin. We don't want your coin, we don't want anything else.
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|On your way, afore we get ploughin' angry, stop bein' all nice.
Geralt|Gonna get in there. Better for you to let me in.
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|And if we don't, then what?
Geralt|I'll kill you.
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|D'you get that?
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|Got it, all right. He threatened us and reached for his weapon.
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Die, you ploughin' bastard!
Geralt|Here's my invite. All yours if you want it.
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|Yeah, gladly take it.
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Incidentally, bloody useless, these crowns. In Temeria, you could say "You met my friend Foltest?" Down in Nilfgaard, it'd be "Emperor'd like to vouch for me." With this shite? Nothin'.
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|That's true! What we got here - some fuckin' ship? Ship couldn't vouch for you. What're you gonna say - "Meet my friend, this ship?" Bloody barmy.
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Downright stupid.
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|All right, you can go in.
Geralt|I think you're about to let me in.
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|By all means, please.
Geralt|And you… wish me luck.
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Luck be with you at the tables.
Geralt|Tough luck. Fair enough.
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|Can't go in there.
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|This is no place for the likes of you.
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Hangin' about like shite 'round a bunghole.
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|You deaf? Bugger off!
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Trader 01|If you've the coin, play as much as you will. If not - there's the door.
Geralt|May I?
Novigrad Trader 01|Why not?
Geralt|Hankering to play. But I'm only interested in high stakes.
Novigrad Trader 01|I don't know you. Perhaps you have coin, perhaps not. Perhaps you can behave, perhaps you cannot.
Novigrad Trader 01|Stay out of trouble and you'll eventually play for high stakes.
Novigrad Trader 01|For now - plenty of tables for commoners upstairs. Don't lose it all too quickly.
Geralt|Owner in? Something I gotta talk to him about.
Novigrad Trader 01|I'm all ears.
Geralt|Wanna talk to Whoreson Junior, not you.
Novigrad Trader 01|Bernie! Dusty!
Novigrad Trader 01|This one's looking for the boss! You have your orders!
Geralt|It's all right. I'll look for a free table.
Novigrad Trader 01|Splendid idea.
Novigrad Trader 01|The gaming tables are upstairs.
Geralt|I'll come back later.
Novigrad Trader 01|As you wish.
Novigrad Trader 01|Strange bird. Who's that?
Novigrad Trader 01|I'm here each day and I've not seen him.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|May I join you?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|I've never seen you here before.
Geralt|Heard Junior comes here sometimes.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Did you, now…? What else have you heard?
Geralt|Whoreson around or not?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Junior was right! Someone's after him!
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Disarm this man!
Geralt|Is that important?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|All who come here do so either by invitation or recommendation.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Who recommended this establishment to you?
Geralt|Men at the door let me in. Not good enough?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|No. Preferable if someone vouched for you… soon.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Until then - I'll have my eye on you.
Geralt|The owner - tell me where he is. Gotta talk to him.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Oh my, you see… Junior's a dear friend.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|I spoke to him today. Know what he said?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|"You find anyone sniffing around for me, they're to stop sniffing, for good."
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Take him! Alive!
Geralt|We done talking? I'd like to play.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|All right, take a seat.
Geralt|Changed my mind. Rather not sit down to a game right now.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|No one's compelling you. Return once you get the urge.
Geralt|Never seen you here, either.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|You've clearly no notion who I am. Don't be clever with me. We don't like clever men around here.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|How did you even learn of this place?
Geralt|Course you haven't. It's my first time here.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|This seat is taken.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|And anyway, high-stakes at this table.
Geralt|Got the coin for it.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|I couldn't care less if you've coin or not.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|What concerns me is how you got in.
Geralt|May I?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|You again? Oh, all right. We're about to deal.
Geralt|Deal me in, then.
Geralt|I win.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Don't you think I know that?
Geralt|Want a rematch?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|What with? You've left me high and dry. I'll not bet half a crown more.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|The luck! Hah! Jolly good hands!
Geralt|I noticed.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|I've a mind to let you win some back if you bring more coin.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|I have no more money. Not a single crown…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Cards lining up today?
Novigrad Nobleman 02|A mutant? What the hell's a witcher doing here?
Novigrad Nobleman 02|See any drowned dead, or other shitzards around here?
Geralt|Nope, no monsters. Great opportunity to play some cards.
Novigrad Nobleman 02|Clever man, eh? All right, we'll play, provided you've coin.
Geralt|I do.
Novigrad Nobleman 02|Fisstech? They've got the best powder in the city right here.
Geralt|Just wanna play.
Geralt|If you insist…
Novigrad Nobleman 02|I believe I will plough your arse like a cheap whore's…
Geralt|Sober up. Then we'll play.
Novigrad Nobleman 02|Hahah - that never happens.
Geralt|Not hunting shitzards tonight. Looking for the owner of this establishment.
Novigrad Nobleman 02|Awww…. Someone asked after him yesterday.
Geralt|Who?
Novigrad Nobleman 02|You know, I don't know. They crushed his head before I could get a good look. Man's swimming with the fishes now.
Novigrad Nobleman 02|Whoreson's always been touchy. But this, this is going too far.
Geralt|Really gotta talk to the owner. Know where I can find him?
Novigrad Nobleman 02|I don't know squat.
Novigrad Nobleman 02|But wait a moment…
Novigrad Nobleman 02|Gentlemen! This here rogue wishes to speak to the owner! Any of you know where Junior is?
Geralt|Thanks for the warning.
Novigrad Nobleman 02|Someone's nice to me, I try to be nice to them.
Novigrad Nobleman 02|At any rate, let's play, shall we?
Geralt|Hello again.
Novigrad Nobleman 02|Got the urge to play, have you?
Novigrad Nobleman 02|I'll not play you anymore. You're bad luck. Go ruin someone else.
Geralt|Look on the bright side. Unlucky at cards, lucky in love.
Novigrad Nobleman 02|Hee hee hee! Took a beating, lad. But come back with coin, and you'll get a chance to win it back.
Novigrad Nobleman 02|Bloody stripped me to the bones. How am I to buy fisstech now?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Cards being kind today?
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Matters little. I don't play plebs.
Geralt|Actually, I was knighted.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Ahem. Indeed? Not to pry, good sir, but who bestowed the accolade?
Geralt|Meve, Queen of Lyria and Rivia. During the Second War.
Geralt|Skirmish broke out on a bridge. Happened to be there with friends. We drove the Nilfgaardians back, then Queen Meve told me to kneel, recite an oath.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|The Battle for the Bridge? Oh yes, heard of that. Ahem. Consider my objections withdrawn, sir.
Geralt|Wanna play?
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Naturally. Good luck to you!
Geralt|Not in the mood for cards. Maybe later.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|I shan't force you, but should you change your mind, I shall be waiting. Ahem.
Geralt|Nice place, isn't it?
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Indeed. More the pity so much rabble comes here. Ahem. Sign of the times, perhaps - coin makes the world go 'round.
Geralt|Owner must've invested a lot.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|He's no miser, although… he might've banned fisstech. It attracts the lowest sort. Ahem. I asked him once if it was absolutely necessary, he just laughed.
Geralt|Maybe I could have a word with him?
Novigrad Nobleman 03|A word of advice, my friend. Never, ever ask after Junior.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Even let you in on a secret: I've been asked to inform whomsoever it concerns the moment anyone started asking after the owner. Be too insistent, and that's exactly what I'll do.
Geralt|Forget I said anything.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Ah, a reasonable man. And reason is man's most important virtue. Where would be today were it not for reason?
Geralt|Nowhere.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Ahem, verily! Nice chat, dear chap. Now what about a game?
Geralt|Don't have a choice. I gotta meet Whoreson Junior.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Ah well.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Gentlemen! This man is asking after the owner. Adamantly so.
Geralt|Leave you to it, then.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Ehem, yes, see you.
Geralt|Mind if I join you?
Novigrad Nobleman 03|No, ahem, take a seat.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Ahem. Congratulations on your victory.
Geralt|Thanks.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Beautiful game, ahem.
Geralt|Congratulations.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|I thank you. Naturally, you're entitled to a rematch.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Well… I've the distinct impression my fortune's shrunk a bit.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Trader 01|Getting good hands.
Geralt|Luck of the draw, today.
Novigrad Trader 01|You might make better use of that luck, then.
Novigrad Trader 01|We've a room for specially selected upstairs. Really big stakes there.
Geralt|If that's the case, I accept the invitation.
Novigrad Trader 01|Come with me.
Geralt|Maybe another time.
Novigrad Trader 01|You ought to try. Few get the honor to play with the owner and his closest associates.
Novigrad Trader 01|Refuse and someone could feel shunned, insulted even.
Geralt|I'm not greedy. I've won enough, thanks.
Novigrad Trader 01|You misunderstand. This is not a request.
Novigrad Trader 01|Take him upstairs!
Novigrad Trader 01|This is the place. Good luck.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Trader 01|Private room for the chosen few. No one'll disturb you here.
Geralt|Doesn't look too cozy. Not a comfortable place to play cards.
Geralt|Someone less trusting might take it for an interrogation room.
Novigrad Trader 01|Junior doesn't believe in miracles.
Novigrad Trader 01|This is where cheats learn just how much he dislikes being robbed.
Novigrad Trader 01|Work him over. Once you're done, wrap a nice thick chain around his legs and drop him in the Pontar.
Geralt|All right. Tired of this charade. Where's Whoreson Junior?
Novigrad Trader 01|So you've come to kill him after all…?
Geralt|Takes a real genius to notice. Where is he?
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|At him! And he needn't survive!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Beat you half to death… Hey, can you hear me?
Geralt|You alive?
Rico|Don't… finish me…
Geralt|Don't intend to.
Rico|Shit, those cocksuckers got me good…
Geralt|Bones are intact.
Rico|Will you free me?
Geralt|You're not hurt all that bad. Let's talk first.
Geralt|Why are you here?
Rico|Eh, what's it look like? Came here to sit and think.
Rico|All right, clever and tough's not working for me. They took me for one of Bedlam's moles.
Geralt|Are you?
Rico|Well… kinda. Yeah.
Geralt|So, what have you… kinda… learned?
Rico|Whoreson's working hand in glove with the Redanians. I don't know the details, but he's on their side. And that's all I know.
Geralt|Take care of yourself.
Rico|Thanks. I'll lay low until things settle down.
Rico|Bedlam'll learn you helped me. See him - he's sure to reward you.
Geralt|Don't trust you an inch.
Rico|Told you all I know, I swear!
Geralt|You'll have to stay a bit longer.
Rico|No, please… Think about it. It's not too late, hear me?!
Geralt|What's your name?
Rico|Rico. Rico Meiersdorf.
Rico|Who the hell are you? Heard screaming downstairs…
Geralt|It's all right now.
Rico|Will you help me?
Rico|Change your mind?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Wily, Whoreson Junior - he's working with Radovid.
Dijkstra|Huh. If this is reliable information, Whoreson's neck-deep in shit.
Geralt|Source seems reliable.
Dijkstra|Hm. It would certainly explain how he had the nerve to break with the Big Four.
Geralt|Need someone who can get me in to see Junior. You must still have some contacts among the Redanians.
Dijkstra|I don't… But you do.
Geralt|Enlighten me.
Dijkstra|Temerian… Former commander of the Blue Stripes… Ring a bell?
Geralt|Vernon Roche.
Dijkstra|He's holed up with his men in a camp near Oxenfurt. Pay him a visit. You're sure to cheer him up, at least.
Geralt|You fallen out with Redania?
Dijkstra|My sympathies have nowt to do with this. Whoreson wiped his arse with our agreement. That's betrayal regardless of his current allegiance.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Went to Junior's joint.
Karl Varese|I heard, I heard. My lads near came to blows wantin' to be the first to tell me. Made quite an impression on them.
Karl Varese|I know Whoreson. Wherever he is, he's positively furious. Won't be able to control himself. He'll leave whatever hidey-hole he found to lay low in.
Geralt|Can't wait.
Karl Varese|Patience, witcher. And cheer up! Cleaver pays well for a job well done. Promised a reward and here it is. More where that came from.
Geralt|Decided to tend to Whoreson Junior myself.
Karl Varese|Aye, I heard. Fuckin' martyr, facin' the world all by his lonesome.
Karl Varese|Your bloody choice. It's not what we agreed, though. So you'll not see a copper out of me.
Geralt|Wasn't expecting anything.
Geralt|Ran into your dwarves at the arena.
Karl Varese|Aye, missed each other at the casino, though.
Karl Varese|Not what we agreed. But Cleaver's a dwarf both loyal and fair. Anyone would tell you that.
Karl Varese|Give half the help, get half the reward.
Geralt|Helped your dwarves at the casino.
Karl Varese|Aye, not at the arena, though. Had to invite themselves in.
<|endoftext|>
Roche|The man we're due to meet is probably waiting already.
Roche|My contact should be there.
Geralt|Ready?
Roche|Contact awaits at the chess club. Let's get this over with.
Geralt|Come on.
Geralt|Your contact - who is it?
Roche|Slippery little bugger. I'd have nothing to do with him were the circumstances any different.
Geralt|Mean you don't trust him?
Roche|I trust no one. Including you.
Roche|Something's not right.
Geralt|Let's see what.
<|endoftext|>
Radovid|Checkmate.
Radovid|They say it's the game of kings. That chess teaches one to think strategically.
Radovid|What a load of rubbish!
Radovid|Both sides have identical pieces, the rules stay invariably the same. How does this mirror real life?
Radovid|Witcher, do you know why I play chess?
Geralt|For... practice? To hone your thinking?
Radovid|No.
Radovid|I play chess to reveal the game's secret.
Radovid|Blood thumps inside these chessmen. You need only listen - and you will hear.
Radovid|Lub-dub, lub-dub, lub-dub… A heart pumping with life.
Radovid|I take a pawn - and hear flesh being rent. I win a piece - and hear screams from the depths of its bowels.
Radovid|I want to break the chessmen open, squeeze the truth from them.
Radovid|Do you see what I mean?
Geralt|Yes, Sire, believe I do.
Radovid|You know shit. You're merely humoring me.
Radovid|I was not speaking literally.
Radovid|First hidden truth: a monarch is always surrounded by fools. Understand?
Geralt|I think I do now.
Radovid|Unimportant… Let us speak.
Radovid|Why have you brought the witcher here?
Roche|I think he'd best explain.
Geralt|I'm looking for Cyprian Wily, Whoreson Junior. I know Redania supports him.
Radovid|Why do you seek him?
Geralt|It's personal.
Radovid|Fair enough, I'll not pry.
Radovid|I have placed Junior in a mansion in Oxenfurt. Very few know this.
Radovid|They'll not let you in unannounced. Thus, you must tell them you've come about the new whores.
Radovid|Junior constantly requests fresh women. I hear he doesn't treat them well.
Geralt|You'd just give me a man? After investing coin and time in him? Can't help but wonder why.
Radovid|Consider it a gesture of goodwill… almost. I'll expect you to return the favor.
Radovid|And also, Junior has lost his purpose. The Big Four is no more.
Radovid|I shall contact you to collect in due course. Now go.
Radovid|And you, Roche - we must speak another time.
Roche|Radovid's sinking ever deeper into madness, as I see it.
Geralt|I know where to find Junior. Don't really care beyond that.
Roche|Geralt. Come to think of it, I too wanted to ask a favor.
Roche|I've a terrible problem with Ves. Need someone to talk some sense into her. Come see me at the camp - I'll tell you more.
Geralt|Let me think about it. See you, Roche.
Geralt|I appreciate the gesture, Your Majesty.
Radovid|A king should be severe towards his foes, generous to his friends. Apart from which I'll expect you to return the favor.
Geralt|Expected a Redanian spy. Had no idea we'd be meeting a king.
Radovid|When you've an opportunity to omit intermediaries, I'd suggest you avail yourself of it.
Geralt|No, still don't get it.
Geralt|No, I don't.
Radovid|You do not because you are not a king. Pawns see only their comrades at their sides and their foes across the field.
Radovid|A king has a different view of the chessboard. His greatest foes surround him. His own chessmen might trap him. And that is check - and death.
Radovid|You see, witcher, chess is the art of sacrificing your own pieces.
Radovid|Now do you see?
Geralt|To kill time?
Radovid|I have no time to squander, let alone kill.
Geralt|To spend time in good company?
Radovid|A king cherishes no one's company.
Geralt|I have no idea.
Redanian Officer 01|Why've you come?
Roche|Not here to play chess, that's a safe bet.
Redanian Officer 01|You can go in, Vernon. Alone.
Roche|This is my friend, Geralt of Rivia. I vouch for him with my life.
Redanian Officer 01|Geralt of Rivia? Very well. His Majesty will see you both.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|What do you want?
Geralt|Where's Whoreson Junior?
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Ooh, this one's got bollocks, don't he.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Junior ought to know someone's sniffin' around.
Geralt|Here to talk about the new girls for Whoreson.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Never seen you here before.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|You know him?
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Can't say I do.
Geralt|I'm new here.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Yeah? What happened to Norbert?
Geralt|Cleaver happened to him.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Poor sod.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Better than to die of consumption… Remember? He looked a bit on the down slope…
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|All right. But next time remember to bring the tarts for Junior through the back, by way of the old canal. Go through there.
Geralt|Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
Geralt|Faulty memory. I've been here before.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Right cheeky whoreson if I seen one.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|You're not the first to try the old walk on through…
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Now, let me show you how we dealt with them.
Geralt|Wanna see Junior.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Tut-tut - you people, honestly. Got nerve comin' to the front door. You're brazen, it ain't right.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|And we aren't stupid, honest. Tell 'im!
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|No. We are not.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Let's gut the bastard!
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|I know you, you motherfucker. Saw you kill Olgard and Vick.
Geralt|Uh, must be a misunderstanding.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Flank the bastard!
Geralt|Believe I did have the pleasure to meet those two gentlemen.
Geralt|What were the names again? Olgard and Vick?
Geralt|Give them my regards.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Whores come through the back. How many times I got tell you?
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Go around back. An' stop ploughin' botherin' me!

Cyprian Willey|What the sandwich fuck is this?
Cyprian Willey|Oh fuck me…
Cyprian Willey|Help me, for fuck's sake!
Geralt|No one's coming.
Cyprian Willey|Ooomph…
Cyprian Willey|Stop…
Cyprian Willey|What… What do you want?
Geralt|Hello, Junior. Been looking for you a while now.
Geralt|I've come to kill you.
Cyprian Willey|I'll give you all I got…
Geralt|Got a few questions to start with.
Cyprian Willey|I'll tell you everything…
Geralt|I'm looking for a young woman and a minstrel. I know you've met them.
Cyprian Willey|A bird? What fucking b--?
Geralt|Ashen-haired with a sword on her back. Just like me.
Cyprian Willey|Yes, yes… Her, that was… I remember…
Geralt|I'd like to know how the ashen-haired woman ended up meeting you, and what happened to her.
Cyprian Willey|What happened to her? She attacked me!
Geralt|Lie one more time, and I'll cut your balls off.
Cyprian Willey|Heheheh…
Cyprian Willey|We'd made a deal. I was to repair their magic phyla-whatsit. The… girl and the songster were to bring me Sigi Reuven's treasure. They didn't, so I might've flown off the handle a bit, I admit…
Geralt|What did you do?
Cyprian Willey|I nabbed their flunky, Dodo, and waited for them to come for him.
Cyprian Willey|Look… this. Here's what they wanted fixed.
Geralt|A phylactery? You can fix something like this?
Cyprian Willey|Not me. I know a guy…
Geralt|Wasting my time, Junior. I need details.
Cyprian Willey|I'll tell you, tell you all! Just the way it happened…
Geralt|Pay attention now. You'll tell the truth. Wanna know why?
Cyprian Willey|I won't lie, honest!
Geralt|Took me a long time to find you. Wasn't an easy road to travel. I'm angry and tired.
Geralt|Had to talk to people I didn't wanna talk to, wouldn't normally talk to.
Geralt|Some of them tried to cheat me, some tried to lie. I didn't like it one bit.
Geralt|I feel like one more lie'd be the last bitter drop in a chalice full of sorrow. And then… then I'd do something I would later regret.
Geralt|Now you know why you can't lie to me?
Cyprian Willey|Yes…
Geralt|Good.
Geralt|Had to kill a lot of people along the way.
Geralt|Hello, Junior. I've come to talk.
Cyprian Willey|I'll do whatever you want…
<|endoftext|>
Dandelion|Got a bad feeling about this…
Cirilla|Calm down, Dandelion. We can't leave Dudu in Whoreson Junior's hands, you know that.
Dandelion|I know, I know. But my gut can't be reasoned with, and no amount of sympathy I feel can silence it, blot it out.
Cirilla choice|I'll go in alone, you know.
Cirilla|I'll go in alone, you know. You'll stay outside.
Dandelion|I can't let you go alone. Anything happens to you, Geralt'll rip my head off!
Cirilla|Someone must secure our retreat. There's bound to be a struggle, things could get intense. We'll need to flee fast, disappear in the crowd.
Cirilla|Have you learned where Whoreson is keeping Dudu?
Dandelion|Room on the top floor. One with the balcony.
Cirilla|I'll need to cross onto the roof. Wait for me in front of Junior's house. And I know it's difficult, but do try to look inconspicuous.
Dandelion|If they… If they hurt you… Whoreson will pay.
Cirilla choice|We'll manage this. I'm sure.
Cirilla|Cheer up. We can manage this, I'm certain.
Dandelion|Famous last words, right there.
Cirilla choice|Pull yourself together.
Cirilla|Get a grip, Dandelion. We must focus on the task at hand.
Dandelion|I'm just saying…
Cirilla|Well then be silent.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Lemme tell you where things stand.
Geralt|I'm looking for this woman, 'cause she's like a daughter to me.
Geralt|And that's why I just can't let this go.
Cyprian Willey|Nooooo!
Geralt|I'm no executioner.
Cyprian Willey|Thank you… I'll make it up to you, I will… This is my city, and--
Geralt|Shut up.
Geralt|Know what? Gotta wonder what your friends from the Big Four'll say when they find out you're working for Radovid…
Cyprian Willey|Hey! Wait! What're you saying?
Cyprian Willey|Waaait!
Geralt|Got anything else to say?
Cyprian Willey|I've told you all I know! Everything…
Geralt|You hurt the woman I'm looking for… You tortured her friend.
Cyprian Willey|She attacked me! I've a right to defend myself!
Cyprian Willey|I beg you… Got what I deserved… Have mercy… Please…
Geralt|What happened to the woman?
Cyprian Willey|Fuck if I know…
Cyprian Willey|One of the boys - got her in the back… But she's alive, I swear it!
Geralt|Dudu - what happened to him?
Cyprian Willey|I don't fucking know… Prick vanished!
Cyprian Willey|There one moment, gone the next…
Cyprian Willey|That's what happened. Told you true.
<|endoftext|>
Radovid|You've never been one to mince words. Very well. Find Philippa Eilhart - that's my wish.
Radovid|I ordered her eyes gouged out once. But apparently, her blindness troubles her not.
Radovid|My hunters have detected Lady Eilhart hiding east of Oxenfurt. They have further established that she has magically sealed the entrance to her shelter. Entering it will be difficult.
Radovid|I believe you might succeed in doing so. Bring her to me - alive.
Geralt|Need to think about it.
Radovid|Don't take too long. We wouldn't want Philippa to escape… again.
Radovid|You may go.
Geralt|Philippa's using magic? You'd be better off sending mages after her.
Radovid|I cannot count on their aid. We parted ways after the events at Loc Muinne.
Geralt|Parted ways…? You gathered them in one place, then gave the order to murder them.
Radovid|You ignore the context. They'd assembled to revive the Conclave, the very same they had once dismantled.
Radovid|I was open to the prospect. The other rulers likewise… Until a certain witcher revealed that the Lodge was behind the regicides.
Radovid|The mages proved to be traitors, while the witcher proved himself skilled at tracking traitors down.
Radovid|Now go to the mountains and bring me Philippa Eilhart.
Radovid|I agreed to the Conclave's revival - but what has this brought me? The mages at my side are mediocrities, cowards. They can't hold a candle to the likes of Eilhart, Laux-Antille or Merigold.
Geralt|There's always your witch hunters.
Radovid|You are the best witch hunter. You've proven it clearly.
Radovid|Síle de Tansarville's and Philippa Eilhart's plan - you were the one to foil it. I want you to finish what you started.
Geralt|Philippa Eilhart. What's she looking for here?
Radovid|I suspect she wants to find her old friends, reconvene the Lodge. Perhaps she seeks revenge, on me.
Radovid|Lady Eilhart is known for her persistence. At times I recall the lessons she gave me when I was a child - her teachings as memorable as the punishments she meted out.
Radovid|She was subtle and patient in her cruelty.
Radovid|I took her sight, but she remains dangerous. I'd advise you to be cautious.
Radovid|There you are.
Geralt|Need something from me, Your Majesty?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Maybe I can help… What do you need?
Dijkstra|I'd rather show than tell. Picture's worth a thousand words and all that tripe. Ah, and you do realize if you say anything about what you see here to anyone, it'll mean a razor between your ribs?
Geralt|Figured as much.
Dijkstra|Excellent. One last request… Oh, let's call it what it is - a command. Don't draw your sword unless I ask you to.
Geralt|I'll get paid on top of that, right?
Dijkstra|Nothing for free, eh? Did you bargain this hard when Emhyr wanted to hire you?
Geralt|No idea what you're talking about.
Dijkstra|You are the worst liar I've ever known… Glad I don't need you to win a poker game for me.
Dijkstra|But we've chatted enough. Yeah, I'll pay you - count on it. So, can I count on you?
Geralt|Who told you?
Dijkstra|What do you mean "who"? Emhyr did.
Geralt|Hahah.
Dijkstra|I could never reveal my sources, to you or anyone else. It would be fucking unprofessional.
Geralt|Don't have time right now.
Dijkstra|Then come back when you do.
Geralt|So what am I supposed to help you with?
Geralt|You were gonna show me something.
Dijkstra|Mhm. And you were going to follow. Come on - no mucking around this time, understood?
Geralt|Listen - Dandelion's missing. Any idea what might've happened to him?
Dijkstra|Same thing that happens to anyone who steps on Junior's toes…
Geralt|Meaning?
Dijkstra|He's surrounded by splendid virgins who ply him with sparkling wine and pastries stuffed with nightingales' tongues.
Dijkstra|Come, Geralt, what do you think's happened to him? I reckon he's at the bottom of the Pontar, trussed up with the strings of his own mandolin.
Geralt|Lute.
Dijkstra|Far as I'm concerned he might as well be rotting down there with a goddamn trombone.
Geralt|Seem a bit prickly… Something bothering you?
Dijkstra|Sorry, I know I've been unbearable lately. But at my age, the menopause, what with hot flashes and violent mood swings…
Geralt|Dijkstra, men don't get menopause. You know that, don't you?
Dijkstra|Yes, you moron. I also know you don't actually give a shite about my problems. What do you want?
Geralt|You got me… Need work, thought you might throw some my way. Monster trouble, that sort of thing.
Dijkstra|Yeah… Might be able to help me, in fact.
Dijkstra|And if you did, why then I might be inclined to ask after Dandelion, establish what happened to him.
Geralt|You wouldn't happen to have a bone to pick with Dandelion, would you?
Dijkstra|Course I do.
Geralt|You serious?
Dijkstra|Dead serious… Dandelion published a sonnet recently. Second stanza - the shit uses paired couplets instead of an inserted rhyme! Surely you understand how deeply offended the poetry lover in me was. The bastard shan't get away with it!
Geralt|I was being serious.
Dijkstra|As am I when I say I have exactly no time to worry about your gigolo boyfriend. Got my own problems…
Dijkstra|Problems you might be able to help me with.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Try to track down the thief yourself?
Dijkstra|Of course. Hired this lummox, Fonce - thick enough not to ask questions. We knocked back some pops antidote and entered the sewers. Soon after, I returned alone.
Geralt|What happened?
Dijkstra|Lad started belchin' something horrendous - I mean, burps with so much mass the walls shook. Told him - Fonce, stop, you're in the presence of a count… well, former count, but still. And then he puked up. Up came most of the antidote, lost his protection.
Dijkstra|Tried to pull him out, then I heard a bubbling… Something crawled out of the water.
Dijkstra|I value the lives of my men, I do… But I value my own even more. Dropped Fonce and ran like hell.
Geralt|Should look around the sewers. Got any more of that pops antidote?
Dijkstra|I've a few vials left. Got the formula, too. Disgusting swill, to be honest. But it'll save your life. Here.
Geralt|Thanks.
Dijkstra|You've naught to thank me for - literally. You're no good to me if you suffocate.
Dijkstra|Listen, I'll be upstairs if you need me. Sight of this empty vault's giving me an ulcer. Good luck to you!
Geralt|Mind describing this "something" that crawled out of the water?
Dijkstra|No. Doesn't mean I can, though. Air in the sewer's thick with spores, can hardly see a thing down there.
Geralt|Musta noticed something. Was it…?
Dijkstra|No, didn't notice a fucking thing. Didn't do a taxonomic field analysis either. I know it's an inconvenience to you, but I felt I should get the hell out of there as fast as I could.
Geralt|Take it the thieves got in through the hole behind you?
Dijkstra|You're a regular fucking master sleuth. Any other brilliant deductions you want confirmed? The year, maybe? Bloody name of Redania's king?
Geralt|No. But I am wondering, for instance, how that hole got there…
Cyclops|Hole no. Boom! Hole. Bart look want go… Bart look no, only sleep. Bad 'shrooms - head foozz.
Geralt|Boom? Can you elaborate?
Cyclops|Boom… Big… Er… this like.
Dijkstra|I'll elaborate. Explosion - big enough to blow that fucking hole in the wall separating the vault from the sewers.
Geralt|Gotten pretty good at communicating with this troll…
Dijkstra|Lots of prior experience - worked with idiots my whole life.
Geralt|Bad mushrooms - what's that about?
Dijkstra|Pops mold. The spores are highly toxic - one whiff and you're dead. Unless you're a troll, that is.
Cyclops|Yes… Bart. Bart troll…
Dijkstra|Not talking to you, dimwit. Where was I? Ah, mold spores. They cover the walls of the sewers other side of the vault. Actually thought it was a good thing, you know, a bit of extra protection. Thieves found a way through it.
Geralt|Bart, you see them?
Cyclops|Bart through hole, want see boom got what. Breathe 'shroom. Sleep go. Chorfun gone. Bad troll…
Dijkstra|Now, now. Stiff upper lip…
Geralt|Anyone see what happened?
Dijkstra|Other than Bart? No. And the vault's location is known only to the treasure's co-owners. Well, and the thieves.
Geralt|What about upstairs? Anything unusual happen in the bathhouse the day of the break-in?
Dijkstra|No. Happen swears it was calm as ever. The usual customers, no incidents. Bloody bucolic.
Geralt|How much was it all worth? Got an approximate idea?
Dijkstra|Why the fuck do you care? Figuring your finder's fee? Don't get your hopes up.
Geralt|Know you too well for that… Just prefer to know what I'm looking for.
Dijkstra|Three crates of Nilfgaardian florens, a chest of emeralds, rubies, and topazes, silver candlesticks and platters… I could go on…
Cyclops|Shiny chorfun… All gone.
Dijkstra|Bart! Stop that! Now!
Cyclops|Bart bad… Bart make Sigi lose chorfun.
Dijkstra|Beating your head against the wall won't change that.
Cyclops|Bart hurt, Bart less thinky. Bart less thinky, Bart sadless.
Geralt|Don't seem to have trouble communicating with the troll… Why'd you bring me down here?
Dijkstra|Take note of that hole. We'll come back to it later.
Dijkstra|And see that door? Vault behind it - until recently filled with Novigrad crowns and countless other valuables.
Cyclops|Bart guard! Then boom! Chorfun go.
Dijkstra|Translating into Common, someone fuckin' made off with nearly twenty tons of my gold, and all the lighter stuff. And you… will help me get it back.
Geralt|Fine. I'll help you.
Dijkstra|You're not exactly bursting with enthusiasm.
Geralt|Witcher mutations. They strip us of emotion. I'd be jumping for joy otherwise.
Geralt|All right. Oughta look around. But first - some questions.
Dijkstra|I'm all ears.
Geralt|Why don't you handle this? Gotta have connections in the underworld. Whaddaya need a witcher for?
Dijkstra|Agh. The gold wasn't mine alone. See, I run a members-only savings club, a bank for the initiated.
Dijkstra|For reasons that should be obvious, I'd prefer it if my temporary liquidity problems remained private… So I need an outsider.
Geralt|How do you know you can trust me?
Dijkstra|I don't… Counting on your survival instinct. Slip up, and I'll kill you, feed you to Bart.
Cyclops|Bart sorry. Bart job that got.
Geralt|It's a tall order, Dijkstra. Need to think it over.
Dijkstra|Fine. Just remember… what you saw here - mum's the word. That's very important. I might even say it's a matter of life and death. Understood?
Geralt|Understood.
Dijkstra|Excellent.
Geralt|Where'd you get the troll?
Dijkstra|From Zerrikania. Won him. Card game with a camel merchant.
Geralt|Your jokes are getting better by the minute.
Dijkstra|See me smiling? I'm dead serious.
Cyclops|Bart eye bumpy horses. Hot there. Sigi Bart take. Good Sigi.
Geralt|About your treasure…
Dijkstra|Yes? Talk to me.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Drain pipe's our only promising lead. We just need to known which pool it's connected to.
Dijkstra|Yes… Happen keeps a record of guests, should be able to tell us who used that pool the day of the break-in… You've not done badly.
Geralt|Feel honored to be acknowledged.
Dijkstra|Oh, that famous sarcasm… I'd missed it.
Geralt|Really?
Dijkstra|Mhm. About as much as I'd miss a knife in my knickers.
Dijkstra|All right. You inspect the pools on the right, I'll take the ones on the left. Holler if you find anything!
Geralt|Bomb went off inside a drainage pipe embedded in the vault wall. But the grate at the end of the pipe was in place when the blast happened, meaning…
Dijkstra|The bomb must have found its way into the pipe from inside the bathhouse.
Geralt|Exactly. Mighta gone something like this: perpetrator started emptying one of the pools, then dropped the bomb down the drain…
Dijkstra|The bomb flowed down with the run-off, came to rest on the grate and, to quote Bart - big boom.
Geralt|Seems to me a bomb blew the wall open. Look.
Dijkstra|Bottom of a silver cylinder, probably. Covered in runes… Interesting… Any idea what it contained?
Geralt|Recognized some ingredients by their scent - wyvern oil and sugar.
Dijkstra|Sugar?! Geralt, I'm in no mood for jests.
Geralt|Nor am I. Just saying what I found - bomb contained sugar.
Dijkstra|Let's think… Sugar would react violently with sulfuric acid… But not so violently to cause an explosion.
Geralt|Didn't know you were versed in alchemy.
Dijkstra|Dabbled in it a bit while at Oxenfurt Academy… But this is no time to reminisce. You're to find my treasure, not write my biography.
Dijkstra|Know anything else about this bomb? Anything at all?
Geralt|Guess I could be wrong. Smell was weak, barely detectable.
Geralt|Found a second corpse - one of the thieves. Threw up the antidote, just like your man Fonce.
Dijkstra|A beautiful death. Anything on the body?
Geralt|Not much. Empty vial.
Dijkstra|Hmm… Wouldn't have left him behind if he was anybody. Common porter, must be. Knew nothing, means nothing. Dead end. Literally!
Geralt|Bits of the treasure dropped out of the crates. Left a clear trail. You know, like the fairy tale… with the crumbs.
Dijkstra|Mhm. I know the one. Hansel, Gretel, burning witches. Very fitting for Novigrad.
Geralt|Trail leads to the river where the sewer lets out… Breaks off there. My bet - they loaded the treasure onto a boat.
Dijkstra|Yes, a cart drawn by sewer rats does seem unlikely. And since boats don't leave trails… it amounts to fuck all.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Anything suspicious happen before the robbery?
Cyclops|Supsichous…? Bart no understand…
Geralt|Something not normal. Something strange. Maybe you saw, felt, heard something…?
Cyclops|Yah. Yah. Bart hear… er… like… er… hiss. Hisssss.
Geralt|All right… Let's change the subject.
Cyclops|Good. Bart time got. Chorfun go. Bart guard now nothing…
Geralt|What kind of hissing was it? Like a snake?
Cyclops|No… Hiss other. Not animal all at.
Geralt|Right. So like what?
Cyclops|Like… rock?
Geralt|A hissing rock. Mhm.
Geralt|The hissing - where did it come from?
Cyclops|Bart hiss hear in lavtree.
Geralt|What?
Cyclops|Where… Where Bart turdy dump.
Geralt|Why do you like Sigi so much?
Cyclops|Sigi good. Sigi care take Bart.
Geralt|He locked you up, alone, underground. Don't get bored down here? Not much to do.
Cyclops|When Bart not much do, Bart think. Lots.
Geralt|What about, if you don't mind my asking?
Cyclops|Rocks.
Geralt|Rocks?
Cyclops|Rocks interesting.
Geralt|Didn't take you for a thinker.
Cyclops|Bart thinker no… Bart troll.
Geralt|Uh, thanks for your help. So long.
Cyclops|Hm, long, long, long.
Geralt|Hey, Bart - got a minute?
Cyclops|Minute? Bart no minute got. Bart rocks got. Rocks want?
Geralt|I mean - a minute to talk.
Cyclops|You mean? Bart nice.
Geralt|One more time… Can we talk?
Cyclops|Sigi you like. Talk me with.
Geralt|Can we talk a bit more?
Cyclops|Bart talk will.
<|endoftext|>
Dijkstra|Got something?
Geralt|Yeah. Bomb part.
Dijkstra|Happen! Drain pool four! And bring me the guest book! Chop-chop!
Geralt|Let's see what's on the bottom…
Geralt|Grate's been removed from the drain, meaning they flushed the bomb down here.
Dijkstra|Happen! Who used this pool the day of the break-in?
Eunuch Happen|Let me see… Berthold Heintz - town councilman, Josef Schveik - brewer… and Margrave Henckel…
Dijkstra|Henckel? That's impossible!
Geralt|Margrave Henckel? Who's that?
Dijkstra|Who was that, you mean!
Dijkstra|Old coot's been eating dirt since last winter! Couldn't have been here the day of the break-in!
Eunuch Happen|He's dead? I'd not heard…
Dijkstra|Not surprisin'. The honorable margrave croaked in a brothel, decked out in leather lingerie, so the family held a hush-hush funeral. But I have my sources.
Eunuch Happen|Yet… Yet I saw him that fateful day, Mr. Reuven. I'm certain of it.
Dijkstra|Did you speak to him? Get a good look at him?
Eunuch Happen|No… He merely passed by on the way in…
Dijkstra|So you didn't see Henckel - you saw an impersonator. Think for once! They scooped out your balls, not your brain! And you, Geralt, start lookin' into this.
Geralt|Fine. Where should I start?
Dijkstra|Henckel's home - derelict townhouse south of the main square. You might happen on some trace of this scoundrel we're looking for there. Well, off with you!
Geralt|Gotta ask me nicely. I'm not one of your delivery boys.
Dijkstra|Pardon my tone. I've grown accustomed to ordering folk around and barking as I do it.
Geralt|Impossible? Why?
Geralt|By the way… What about Happen? Could've overheard you mention the vault, has access to the bathhouse whenever he wants…
Dijkstra|Happen has numerous flaws. He's pompous, pretentious, can be a real prick sometimes, ironic as that may sound… But his loyalty's beyond question.
Geralt|How can you be so sure?
Dijkstra|Witchers know their monsters, spies know their men.
Geralt|You trusted Philippa Eilhart once, too…
Dijkstra|True. But I didn't pull Philippa Eilhart out of a Koviri prison the night before her execution.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Bullshit. You don't trust me.
Dijkstra|I trust you as much as you trust me - not at all. Believe me, it's a healthy relationship.
Triss|Gentlemen… Really feel privileged to witness your battle of wits…
Triss|...but try to remember - unlike you, I put my life at risk every time I venture out into the streets. Did the same just coming here. So I beg you - can we get to the point?
Geralt|Bothered Triss for nothing. No point examining the bomb.
Dijkstra|Because?
Geralt|Cause I already know who nabbed your treasure. Commander of the Temple Guard. Caleb Menge.
Dijkstra|Well, well, Merigold… Your coin stands to come with a side of revenge.
Dijkstra|Geralt, would you be kind enough to tell me what you've learned? I'm terribly curious.
Geralt|Henckel told me. Old man's alive and well - faked his own death to escape his creditors.
Dijkstra|Strange… I had no idea he was in debt.
Geralt|He was. And Menge promised to take care of things in exchange for help with the heist, so…
Dijkstra|Geralt, how can I put this delicately… Bollocks.
Dijkstra|If you thought I'd fall for that tale you just pulled out of your arse, you don't know me one bit.
Geralt|All right, I lied… But only partly.
Dijkstra|Heard of beasts that are half-lion, half-eagle, maidens who're half-fish… But you'll never convince me there's such a thing as a half-truth.
Geralt|I'll give it a shot anyway. Didn't actually see Henckel - but Menge does have your treasure.
Dijkstra|Take it you learned this by peering into a crystal ball?
Geralt|Maybe. Trade secret.
Dijkstra|You're hiding somethin'. And that's one thing I can't stand. Even more than Nilfgaard.
Dijkstra|But ultimately, this is a business deal, not a marriage. Besides, there must be some truth in all those lies - you're too dense to make it all up on your own.
Dijkstra|Hm, Menge has been spending heaps of coin lately, though to my knowledge he shouldn't have a copper to his name…
Triss|So. What now?
Dijkstra|From what I've heard, Menge spends his nights at the docks, witch hunters' quarters… Maybe pay him a visit, ask where he's holding my gold for me.
Geralt|Doubt Menge'll admit anything willingly…
Dijkstra|As do I. Lucky I hired a witcher and a sorceress who've been through so much together to get this done…
Triss|What's our past got to do with it?
Dijkstra|A great deal. Lovers will jump into the abyss for one another… Suits my needs perfectly.
Dijkstra|Namely, it greatly increases your chances of getting out of the hunters' barracks alive - with my treasure.
Geralt|Information's out of date. We are not…
Dijkstra|Yes, I know. You parted a week after the summit at Loc Muinne, in the woods near where the Lixela flows into the Pontar. But you know what they say… Old love never dies.
Triss|First. First love. Now how the hell…?
Dijkstra|Mha, that's my secret, lovebirds… Really must be going. Good luck.
Triss|Didn't have to disagree so… strongly…
Geralt|Put yourself in my shoes. What would you have said?
Triss|In your shoes, I wouldn't be worrying about what to say to Dijkstra. At all.
Triss|But we've strayed from our topic… Got a treasure to recover.
Geralt|Triss, gotta tell you something… Dijkstra's gold - it's the last thing I care about.
Triss|Thought as much… This is about Ciri, isn't it?
Geralt|Mhm. Menge's got Dandelion locked up somewhere… And Dandelion saw Ciri.
Triss|That changes everything. Listen, meet me at midnight by the chapel of the Eternal Fire east of the harbor. We'll figure out a way to get into the hunters' barracks together.
Geralt|All right. See you then… And thanks.
Geralt|Sorry, didn't mean to hurt your feelings…
Triss|Hope not.
Geralt|In other words, you're using us.
Dijkstra|Using you? Never! Merely makin' the most of your mutual bond. Hahaha. Well, lovebirds… I really must be going. Good luck.
Triss|Thought you'd correct him… Say that we… You know.
Geralt|Dijkstra doesn't need to know about my love life.
Triss|Wise… I'd never choose his shoulder to cry on either.
Geralt|Could've corrected him yourself.
Triss|True… But it's not an easy thing to say, is it?
Geralt|Mhm. So we do your dirty work while you sit around twiddling your thumbs?
Dijkstra|Darling, when I'm able to make use of someone, I always do. It's convenient.
Geralt|And safe… Come on, admit you're scared of Menge.
Dijkstra|Of course I'm scared… Bloody dangerous whoreson. Triss would concur, I think.
Triss|Not in those words… But I do agree with the statement overall.
Geralt|Know you well enough to know what matters: results… So I lied. Still say I can lead you to your treasure.
Dijkstra|Forgive me, Geralt… But after what you just pulled, I'd sooner believe a whore who proclaimed her undying love.
Triss|Would you believe a sorceress who stands to gain if you get your coin back?
Dijkstra|Perhaps… I'd still prefer the whore, though.
Geralt|What I've learned doesn't matter.
Dijkstra|Doesn't matter?! Yet you agreed to help me.
Geralt|I am. Doesn't mean I have to confess everything.
Dijkstra|I'll let your insolence fly this time - but only because his honor the margrave might indeed have something to do with the theft.
Geralt|Hang on. Gotta tell my why you're here first. We agreed - if I learned anything, I'd take it to you.
Dijkstra|So we did… But I was concerned about you. Stopped by to see if everything was all right.
Geralt|Thanks. You can breathe easy now. In the future, though, remember this - I can look after myself.
Dijkstra|Fine. You look after yourself, and I'll look after my interests.
Geralt|Didn't expect to see you here… Certainly not with Triss.
Dijkstra|I decided we could use someone who knows a bit of magic. The runes on the bomb - I'm absolutely dying to know what they mean…
Geralt|You dying to know too, Triss?
Triss|No. Just here for the coin.
Dijkstra|Ah, Merigold playing the cynical materialist. I love it.
Dijkstra|In truth, her ideals brought Triss here. She needs gold to save her colleagues… When I recover my treasure, I'll be in a position to help her. Simple as that.
Dijkstra|Speaking of which, and, pardon my Beauclairoise, have you found out who fucking nicked my gold?
<|endoftext|>
Triss|Glad you're here. Listen…
Triss|Took a look at the building and it does not look good.
Geralt|Mean it could use a bit of paint and spackle?
Triss|I mean it's a damned fortress. High walls, guards at the gate, armed men everywhere. We could never sneak in, and fighting our way in won't work - Menge would have plenty of time to escape.
Geralt|What do you suggest?
Triss|Take these shackles… Put them on me.
Geralt|Mind explaining what this is all about?
Triss|Think… Bring the hunters the vile Triss Merigold, they won't just open the gate for you, they're likely to let you present her to Menge personally.
Geralt|No way. Too risky.
Triss|Dandelion's life's on the line… Ciri's too. No such thing as too risky.
Geralt|Fine, let's say they take the bait… What then? We go in, I put a sword to Menge's throat and ask him where Dandelion is?
Triss|Might not work. Menge's scum, but you have to admit… Death doesn't scare him.
Geralt|Always found that annoying in fanatics. So we gotta trick him into talking. Any ideas?
Triss|Uhh… Maybe tell him you have information about the Lodge - or about Philippa, even better, he hates her most of all. You'll think of something.
Geralt|Still got a bad feeling about this… But tough. Let's go.
Geralt|Wait. I wanna thank you.
Triss|Come on. Anyone would do this…
Geralt|No. Not anyone.
Triss|Stop. It doesn't befit a sorceress to blush.
Geralt|What about the treasure?
Triss|If we learn anything, great. If not…
Geralt|Thought you need coin from Dijkstra to help the other mages.
Triss|True, I do… Lots of ways to get gold, though. It's just not the most important thing now.
Geralt|Triss, think about it… Really want to walk into the lion's den of your own free will - and in chains?
Triss|Yes.
Geralt|No. Can't allow it.
Triss|Nice of you to worry… But I've made my decision, and I won't change it.
Geralt|Uh, Triss… Sure you want to do this? Out here? With everyone watching?
Triss|This might come as a surprise to you, but shackles do have uses outside the bedroom.
Triss|You're back… Put the shackles on me and let's go. Just please… Don't do anything stupid.
<|endoftext|>
Triss|Geralt, remember, I can take care of myself.
Geralt|What're you talking about?
Triss|The hunters… They won't treat me like a lady. But I'll survive. Might hurt a bit, but…
Triss|Ciri - she's what matters… Do what you need to do, no matter what happens.
Geralt|Can't promise that.
Triss|I'm still asking you to. All right?
Geralt|All right.
Triss|I think we're going the wrong way…
Triss|I really shouldn't saunter around town long… Someone might recognize me.
<|endoftext|>
Witch Hunter 01|Well, well… Triss Merigold. Given up drowners for sorceresses?
Geralt|Pay's better.
Witch Hunter 02|It's 'cause they do more harm. What's a drowner do? Pull the odd fisherman from his boat? But the witches, they murder kings. Scheme. Start wars.
Triss|Don't forget turning your cows' milk sour straight out of the udder.
Triss|Aaaah!
Witch Hunter 01|You're done jesting, Merigold. For good.
Witch Hunter 01|Put her in a cell.
Geralt|Not so fast. I hand her over to Menge himself - or not at all.
Witch Hunter 02|You reckon we don't know what to do with this witch?
Triss|Let go, you bastard.
Witch Hunter 02|Vulgar tongue's got no place bein' in such a pretty mouth. I guess we'll have to rip it out.
Geralt|Try to loosen it, if I were you. Might learn something interesting.
Witch Hunter 01|For instance?
Geralt|For instance, where Philippa Eilhart's hiding.
Triss|I'll get you for this, you…
Witch Hunter 03|Shut your gob, ginger whore! And you spit it out - where's Eilhart?!
Geralt|Thought I made myself clear - I'll only talk to Menge.
Witch Hunter 03|Menge don't talk to the likes of you.
Geralt|Well then you be sure and tell him I came by. With my friend Merigold.
Witch Hunter 01|Fine… Grab her and come with me. But be sure to stay right close.
Geralt|Don't talk to her that way.
Witch Hunter 03|Why not? She is a whore, ain't she?
Geralt|Maybe, but for now she's my whore and I say you can't insult her.
Witch Hunter 02|Funny you feel that way, but so be it… Now. Philippa. Talk.
Geralt|Last time I say this. Don't call her that.
Witch Hunter 02|Why not?
Witch Hunter 02|Would you be bothered if I cut off her pinky?
Geralt|Yes.
Geralt|Yeah - you might know how to handle witches, when they're brought to you in chains.
Witch Hunter 01|What's that supposed to mean?
Geralt|That you're crap witch hunters if a witcher's gotta do your hunting for you.
Witch Hunter 02|Listen here, mutant… Since we entered this town, we've made ashes of over a hundred mages, alchemists, dopplers and other vermin. So don't you be tellin' us how to do our jobs, got it?
Geralt|Actually, think I could tell you a thing or two… It's not just Merigold. I've also tracked down Philippa Eilhart.
Geralt|What's it they say? Quality over quantity? 'Cause if it were about numbers, you might as well burn herbalists, village healers, hell, entire villages, black cats included…
Witch Hunter 01|You must think you're funny.
Witch Hunter 02|Maybe he is, fuck if we know. Thing is, we've no sense of humor.
Geralt|You're not gonna rip her tongue out.
Witch Hunter 02|Cause why?
Geralt|Cause this.
Geralt|Hands off.
Witch Hunter 01|What'd you say?
Witch Hunter 02|Argh, sensed it. Knew we couldn't trust him… Witcher, witch… One and the same.
Witch Hunter 03|So they can burn at one and the same stake.
<|endoftext|>
Witch Hunter 01|Here's where we split up. Go see Menge. Merigold'll be next door.
Geralt|You can't have her until I get--
Witch Hunter 01|You don't set the terms here. Dirk! You know what to do.
Triss|You won't get a word out of me. Not you, not him.
Witch Hunter 02|Playin' tough, eh? Just you wait… We'll take a fingernail or three. That oughta get you singin'.
Geralt|Do what you want.
Witch Hunter 02|Come on, witch… Show you the wonders a pair of pliers can work. You'll be surprised.
Geralt|Fine. Take her. I'd rather she didn't interrupt my conversation. But hands off, don't touch her.
Witch Hunter 01|Why? Feel sorry the bitch?
Geralt|No. Couldn't give a shit about her… But if I don't get what I want from Menge, I'll want to sell her to someone else. Don't want you damaging the goods.
Witch Hunter 01|Keen nose for enterprise. You'd make a great madame.
Witch Hunter 01|Don't you worry, Menge'll give you your coin… And Merigold will get what she deserves.
Geralt|No torture till I get there. Got it?
Witch Hunter 01|Got it… No torture…
Witch Hunter 02|Wha…? Whoreson's castin' spells! Get him!
Geralt|All right, had enough of this charade.
Witch Hunter 01|What're you on about?
Geralt|Watch and learn.
<|endoftext|>
Menge|I believe I told you not to let anyone in.
Witch Hunter 01|Unless they had information concernin' Philippa Eilhart… This witcher says he's got just that.
Menge|Anyone can claim that.
Witch Hunter 02|We'll start with your pinky nail. Nah, let's go for your ring finger.
Witch Hunter 02|This little piggy went to market…
Triss|Aaaach!
Witch Hunter 01|But it's not that easy to bring us Triss Merigold.
Menge|Is that who I hear…? Very well. I'll go see her shortly. But first - let us talk. Sit, sit.
Menge|Have a drink, witcher.
Geralt|Cidarian.
Menge|A 1261 vintage. Year of the massacre of Cintra.
Witch Hunter 01|Ah - stop squirming. Heh. This little piggy went home!
Triss|Aaah! Stop!
Menge|Kurt, please see why Miss Merigold squeals so convincingly. Perhaps she needs something? Hot irons, for instance?
Geralt|Speaking of metal… this goblet's silver. Making sure I'm not a doppler?
Menge|Ah, it's immediately apparent - a professional. I find that refreshing.
Menge|But to answer your question - one can never be too careful. You'd be surprised how many who come here turn to rancid jelly as soon as they grip the goblet.
Geralt|Got a silver sword on my back. That not enough?
Menge|It proves nothing. Dopplers can change their bodies at will, into materials that look and feel like silver as well… Materials that have none of silver's useful properties, naturally.
Geralt|See you're an expert on dopplers.
Menge|I'd expect a witcher of all… things… to understand the value of knowing one's enemy.
Menge|Now, let us talk shop.
Menge|I shall pay you twice the usual reward for Merigold.
Geralt|Awfully generous. Why?
Menge|Well... you've turned in your lover. The emotional trauma it must entail… you deserve compensation.
Geralt|Yeah, I've ploughed Triss. But what does it matter if you're paying gold for her head?
Menge|Oh yeah… haha. Nearly forgot - the mutations strip witchers of feelings.
Triss|No… No more… I can't…
Witch Hunter 01|Be brave, dear - just one more fingernail and we'll move to the other hand. This little piggy went wee, wee, wee…
Witch Hunter 01|Ow! Bitch bit me!
Witch Hunter 02|Haha! The bitch bites! Let's put a collar on her. Dimeritium ought to calm her down.
Menge|You surprise me… Geralt. Perhaps we can deal after all.
Menge|So. You know something about Philippa… But I wager you won't share this information for free. What do you want in return?
Geralt|It's simple… Free Dandelion.
Menge|A degenerate bard for information about Philippa… Tempting offer, I admit. But I must say no.
Menge|You see, I've a magnificent execution planned for Dandelion. In Oxenfurt. A breaking wheel, flaying alive and so forth… It should work wonders for the mores of the academic youth and townsfolk.
Geralt|When's this morally instructive spectacle due to take place?
Menge|When I issue the order. In person. Dandelion will remain in the dungeons beneath Temple Isle until then.
Menge|So sorry I cannot be of help… Perhaps we can agree different terms?
Menge|But first let's see how Miss Merigold fares. It's… It's grown suspiciously quiet in there. Come.
Geralt|All right. So free Dandelion.
Menge|First you ask about a criminal's treasure… Now you want me to let loose a blaspheming degenerate. And here I had you for a man-- that is, a being… of some moral principle.
Geralt|No doubt we're cut from different cloth. But we don't have to agree on everything to make a deal.
Menge|We need not agree any terms, either. I could simply force you to tell me what you know about Philippa.
Geralt|Doubt that. I really doubt that.
Menge|Whereas I'm a man of great faith.
Menge|Guaaaards! In here!
Geralt|I'm looking for a treasure. Was Sigi Reuven's until recently…
Menge|Well, well… Furthering the cause of the Eternal Fire on the one hand, working for criminals on the other…
Geralt|I work for whoever pays me.
Menge|Like a whore?
Geralt|More or less. Just offer a different range of services. Where's the treasure?
Menge|Secure in a Koviri bank. Far and safe from you, far and safe from Reuven.
Geralt|Got information about Philippa. Thought you might want to buy it…
Menge|I do. But not at any price.
Geralt|Know what…? Fuck you. Had enough of this masquerade.
Geralt|No idea what you're talking about…
Menge|You underestimate me. You see, I know everything about Merigold - her special talents, what she fears, who she's quarreled with, who she's shagged and who's ploughed her.
Menge|Sensed from that start that this might be a provocation. Your inept lie just confirmed my suspicions.
Geralt|You seem well informed… So you have to know Triss betrayed me first - used me as a pawn in the Lodge's game. As I see it, she's getting what she deserves.
Geralt|Think I just changed my mind. Let her go.
Menge|Didn't take much to get you to break.
Geralt|No way around this?
Menge|Of course there is. Dopplers also assume their true form when subjected to horrific pain… So I could have you flogged. Effective, true - but the goblet method is much quicker.
Menge|Now let us get down to business.
Geralt|Still haven't paid me for the witch… Yet your hunters are already torturing her.
Menge|What of it?
Geralt|You're damaging goods you haven't paid for yet.
Menge|Don't worry. You shan't leave empty-handed.
Geralt|Enough. Let Triss go. Now.
Menge|What? Who are you to give me orders?
Geralt|A man with a sharp sword who doesn't like to repeat himself.
Geralt|Not in the mood.
Menge|You've two choices, witcher… Drink, or die.
Geralt|There's a third option.
Menge|Oh yeah? What might that be?
Geralt|I'm going to kill you.
Geralt|Why the drink?
Menge|Triss Merigold has been captured… An occasion worthy of a toast, don't you think?
Geralt|Tell your boys to leave Triss alone first.
Menge|Not a chance. The bitch must howl.
Geralt|I've tried to be polite. You just won't let me.
Witch Hunter 02|This little piggy had roast beef….
Triss|Aaayye…! You bastard… No…
Witch Hunter 02|This little piggy had none….
Triss|Aaa…. Aaaaa….
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Let's search his corpse.
Triss|Right… Could find something that'll help us…
Triss|Just his office key in his pockets. Here… Nothing under his belt… Wait! Something's sewn in the lining…
Geralt|What is it?
Triss|The key to a vault.
Triss|Here. Give it to Dijkstra with my regards.
Triss|Nothing but dead ends… We'll need to make do…
Geralt|Menge's the only one who could've ordered Dandelion's release.
Triss|Yes… Or someone who looks exactly like him…
Geralt|A doppler?
Triss|Mhm. Your old friend, Dudu Biberveldt - impersonated the halfling merchant? Dandelion claimed he seemed more real than the original. So much so Vivaldi gave him a loan of several thousand crowns without batting an eye.
Geralt|Yeah. Except Dudu's in hiding right now. Priscilla might know something, though.
Triss|Fingers crossed. Listen, there is one other thing I wanted to talk about. But not here, not now. Come by when you have a moment? I'd appreciate it. All right… we need to get out of here.
Geralt|Breaking Dandelion out's starting to look like our last option…
Triss|Geralt, you know me… I'm all for finding solutions. I don't give up easily…
Triss|But in this case, there's no hope, not a shred. No one escapes the dungeons beneath the temple… And no one's ever been broken out.
Geralt|Anyone actually tried?
Triss|They've tried, Geralt-- I've tried, to be exact. Shortly before you arrived. It almost cost me my life.
Geralt|Could you… revive him?
Triss|Maybe… If I actually practiced black magic. Haven't sunken that low just yet.
Geralt|Yennefer did it. It was the only way we--
Triss|I'm not Yennefer, Geralt. I never will be. I'm sorry.
Geralt|You're right… Never mind.
Geralt|Saw Menge burn a sheet of paper - right before we came in here.
Triss|Could've been something on it that would've helped us. Argh, too late now.
Geralt|So, there's no way you can recover the note…?
Triss|Sadly, no. I'm a sorceress, not a miracle worker.
Geralt|I should tend to your wounds…
Triss|No need. I'm fine.
Triss|Well… mostly fine. Should heal in time for my wedding.
Geralt|Sorry. Shoulda gotten you out sooner…
Triss|Don't apologize. I knew what I was signing up for.
Geralt|How do I say this… That was just a bit premature.
Triss|What do you mean?
Geralt|Menge said Dandelion's locked up on Temple Isle. Dungeon right under the temple. He was planning to execute him in Oxenfurt…
Geralt|Also said they'd only let Dandelion out of his cell once Menge gave the order… in person.
Triss|Shit… I'm sorry, Geralt… I… should've thought it through, but… When I saw him, I…
Geralt|What's done is done.
Triss|He… He'd never have agreed to help us… Even if I…
Geralt|I know. Let's not dwell on this. We should think about what to do next…
Triss|Dandelion's safe for now… Though out of reach.
Triss|We don't stand a chance of breaking him out - Temple Isle's impregnable… And Menge's not likely to order his transfer, or anyone's for that matter…
Geralt|After what they subjected you to… No need to explain.
Triss|He say where Dandelion is?
Geralt|Yes… But…
Geralt|Triss…
<|endoftext|>
Triss|Think that's all of them… That was close.
Triss|I must say, trickery and deceit - not your strong suits.
Geralt|True. I prefer straightforward solutions.
Triss|Yeah. Fight first, ask questions later.
Triss|We should search the office. Maybe we can find some documents mentioning Dandelion…
Triss|I'll search his body. You search the room.
Triss|I'd start with the desk.
Triss|What happened? I thought Menge took the bait…
Geralt|He did… I cracked. Couldn't listen to you suffer.
Triss|Nice of you… But I could've handled it. Really.
Geralt|He did… Until I asked about the treasure.
Triss|Geralt… We talked this over, you agreed…
Triss|Ugh, fine. Never mind.
Geralt|No, he didn't. Sensed right off it was all a front.
Triss|Axii in a crowd…? Geralt, there was no way that could work.
Geralt|Sorry… I couldn't let them torture you. You mean too much to me.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Find anything?
Geralt|All right. Nothing left for us here. Let's go.
Triss|Be glad to. Just not by way of the main gate.
Geralt|I found a letter to Menge, from someone important. A spy, I think.
Triss|A spy?
Geralt|Take a look.
Triss|Drop boxes, secret signals… Yeah… Strong stench of spy craft here… This agent could know more about Dandelion.
Geralt|Bet he does. Letters explains how to signal for a meeting - no mention of where it would take place.
Triss|Maybe Dijkstra can help. He knows everything.
Geralt|Everything? Slight exaggeration there.
Triss|I'm not so sure.
Geralt|Key to a vault? No address? Why do I doubt this'll make Dijkstra smile?
Triss|Well, might keep him from setting his thugs on us, breaking our legs for failing to fulfill our part of the bargain.
Geralt|Meaning, glass is half full?
Triss|Of something strong, I hope…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Me and Menge… didn't see eye to eye.
Dijkstra|How badly?
Geralt|Badly.
Dijkstra|I suppose that explains the smoke… My treasure's not in there, is it? Burning with the witch hunters…?
Geralt|Didn't see it anywhere… And twenty tons of gold is hard to miss.
Dijkstra|You mean to say you've come to me empty-handed?
Geralt|First off, you came to me. Second, I do have something in my hand… The key to a vault. Found it on Menge.
Dijkstra|A vault? That I need to find on my own? You've not made things much easier for me. Gimme that.
Geralt|That's all you're going to say? No wry remark? No scintillating joke?
Dijkstra|Hahaha… You want a knee-slapper? Fine, I'll tell you one. Ready?
Dijkstra|You lied to me.
Geralt|What?
Dijkstra|You knew from the start who robbed me. But you didn't deign to share that information with me.
Geralt|No, I didn't. But I did deign to help you find your treasure, so stop moaning.
Dijkstra|I jest you not, Geralt. You abused my trust.
Geralt|I can live with that.
Dijkstra|This time, yes, you'll live.
Dijkstra|And now… Time to settle things.
Geralt|That a threat?
Dijkstra|Quite the contrary. You helped me, witcher, so in spite of everything you've earned your reward.
Dijkstra|I take it you've still no idea what happened to Dandelion?
Geralt|None. Found someone who might know, though. A spy, I guess - signs his name "Yamurlak." Found a letter of his. Just one problem - it only details how to arrange a meeting with him. Makes no mention of where--
Dijkstra|A ruined house in Farcorners. Give the signal, and he’ll show up there the same day, just before midnight.
Geralt|Thanks for your help.
Dijkstra|No need to thank me. Just paying off a debt. I always do, you know. Even to liars.
Dijkstra|And a final humble plea. Don't try to fool me again… ever.
Geralt|Probably shouldn't ask, but… Dijkstra, how the hell do you know all this?
Dijkstra|I draw it all from the flight patterns of birds.
Geralt|Your sarcasm - it gets tiring, you know?
Dijkstra|I've far worse qualities than that. Believe me.
Geralt|Don't bother. I know what happened to Dandelion.
Dijkstra|Then take my coin. I always pay my debts… Even to liars.
Geralt|How'd you find out?
Dijkstra|I ask the questions here.
Geralt|Not true. That was a statement.
Geralt|Come on, Dijkstra. This tough-guy act - doesn't work on me. We're both adults. Act like one.
Dijkstra|Hahahah! Ah, Geralt… I should have you strangled, but I like you, you bastard.
Geralt|I like you too… you count without a county.
Geralt|Now that we've professed our feelings for each other… How'd you figure it out?
Dijkstra|Sensed from the start you were up to something. You didn't haggle about your pay. And then I heard from my sources that Margrave Henckel and Dandelion had rubbed elbows. Wasn't hard to connect the dots.
Geralt|That makes one of us.
Dijkstra|I know, I know… Oh, the sleep I lose because of that…
Dijkstra|Again.
Geralt|Spare me… I want my reward.
Dijkstra|Geralt… Do all you witchers have such nerve?
Geralt|Whaddaya mean?
Geralt|No. Your gold's in a Koviri bank. Here's the key to the vault that holds it.
Dijkstra|Well, well… Would've earned yourself a medal if I was in a position to bestow them.
Dijkstra|Quite the opposite. Your reward… Earned it, all the same. Triss will get her coin as well, have her chance to fritter it away on foolish ideals.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|You there! Mr. Reuven wants a word.
Geralt|Impatient old bastard…
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Wha?
Geralt|Nothing. Be there soon.
Dijkstra|Who do I spy? Why, it's Geralt of Rivia!
Geralt|Ugh… Will you stop following me already?
Dijkstra|I will. Soon as you tell me where my treasure is.
<|endoftext|>
Redanian Noble 01|Menge?
Geralt|Indisposed. Very indisposed.
Redanian Noble 01|I don't know who you are… But you're in deep. Shit right up to your nostrils.
Triss|You're in deeper, I assure you… But answer our questions, and we'll help you get out.
Redanian Noble 01|My answer to each question will be the same: sod off.
Geralt|That's no way to talk to a lady.
Redanian Noble 01|To a lady, I'd never… but to a witch?
Triss|You can. Wouldn't recommend it, though.
Redanian Noble 01|Aaaaaargh!
Triss|Had enough?
Redanian Noble 01|Ffffff… Fffffuck off… I can take this…
Triss|Of course you can. But I'm just getting started.
Redanian Noble 01|Aaargh!
Triss|You must be thinking: this can't possibly hurt any worse… Oh, it can.
Redanian Noble 01|Aaarrgh! Enough…ugh! Enough!
Geralt|So? Gonna talk?
Redanian Noble 01|Depends… on the question.
Geralt|Enough… We've learned everything we wanted to.
Redanian Noble 01|Glad to hear it. Can I assume we can put this unfortunate incident behind us and…
Triss|Not so fast. Geralt…
Geralt|I know. He's seen too much.
Redanian Noble 01|But why… I told you… I'll never…
Triss|Either he dies… Or I wipe his mind.
Geralt|As good as lit the pyres with Menge in the square. He deserves to die.
Redanian Noble 01|But… But I helped you… I help--
Triss|Faeren, angau.
Geralt|How do you feel?
Triss|Base. Cruel. Vile.
Triss|I could go on… but I need to get out of here - now. Go home, bathe… then drink myself to oblivion.
Geralt|Said you had an idea - about freeing Dandelion…
Triss|Yes… We know he's on the island. And he'll stay there until Menge orders him transferred to Oxenfurt, right?
Geralt|Mhm. Problem is Menge's dead, so…
Triss|No one else knows that. He could've escaped the fire… He could reappear… Him, or someone very, very similar.
Geralt|A doppler?
Triss|Mhm. Your old friend, Dudu Biberveldt, impersonated the halfling merchant. Dandelion claimed he seemed more real than the original. So much so Vivaldi gave him a loan of several thousand crowns without batting an eye.
Geralt|Yeah. Except Dudu's in hiding right now. Priscilla might know something, though.
Triss|Fingers crossed.
Geralt|Walk you home…?
Triss|Not today, Geralt. Not today.
Triss|But… There is one other thing I wanted to talk about. So, mind coming by later? Menge's dead, true, but that hardly marks the end of my troubles.
Geralt|Really showed your claws today…
Triss|Is that how you see it? I'd put it differently. I showed how little I differ from these bastards.
Triss|I… Let's finish up and leave. I want to go home, bathe… and get drunk.
Geralt|Strip him of his memory.
Redanian Noble 01|But… But I helped you… I help--
Geralt|It's not so bad. I promise.
Triss|Caesle, angaef.
Geralt|We're looking for Dandelion. We know Menge captured him.
Redanian Noble 01|Th-that? That's what this is all about? A fucking minstrel?
Redanian Noble 01|You might've said so from the start. Before you bloody started mucking my mind with magic?
Redanian Noble 01|I can't believe it… For a miserable sap like that…
Geralt|Get to the point.
Redanian Noble 01|Dandelion is on Temple Isle. In the dungeon beneath the shrine. Menge's planning to execute him in Oxenfurt… Positively spectacular.
Geralt|Afraid you'll have to call off the show.
Triss|How can we free Dandelion?
Redanian Noble 01|Those who leave Temple Isle do so only on Menge's orders… Issued in person.
Geralt|Dammit…
Triss|We'll find a way. I have an idea. Tell you later.
Geralt|You expect an apology?
Redanian Noble 01|No… But I've a right to be surprised, haven't I?
Geralt|Pure curiosity… Who do you work for?
Redanian Noble 01|Won't say. No way.
Triss|Sure about that?
Redanian Noble 01|Yes. No matter what you do, witch… That I will never reveal.
Redanian Noble 01|Hgh ugh hghgh... Radovid. I work for Radovid.
Geralt|Where'd Menge hide Sigi Reuven's treasure?
Redanian Noble 01|I… I haven't a clue.
Triss|You realize - one word and you'll howl with pain again?
Redanian Noble 01|Yeah - and yet I still say I don't know a thing. Does that make you think?
Geralt|Think he's telling the truth?
Triss|Looks like it.
Geralt|Radovid - what'd he hope to gain by helping Menge?
Redanian Noble 01|He seeks to clear the field. Before he arrives.
Geralt|Makes sense. Easier to take a city whose mages are gone.
Triss|Bastard… he'll pay for this.
Redanian Noble 01|Yes, yes! Just tell me what the fuck about!
Geralt|Triss, stop.
Triss|First let him--
Geralt|Please.
Geralt|You'll talk. Just a matter of time. So save us some, yourself some, too, and stop acting tough.
Redanian Noble 01|Or what?
Geralt|Or I'll have to hurt you. Permanently.
Redanian Noble 01|I see you know your way around an interrogation… So do I. You're the bad one, all threats and torture, and the red one's the good one, full of sympathy and sweet promises…
Triss|That's where you're wrong.
Geralt|Triss? How'd you know to-- Ah, Dijkstra, huh?
Triss|None other. I couldn't resist… Really want to see this through to the end.
Geralt|Perfect place for a tryst… with Triss…
Triss|Mhm… Ceiling's collapsed, mold on the walls, mouse droppings in the corner… Lips almost pucker on their own…
Geralt|Shh. He's coming. Hide.
Triss|See you soon, Geralt.
<|endoftext|>
Zoltan Chivay|And never come back, ye stinkin' scadges!
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|All's we wanted was…
Zoltan Chivay|Don't give a flyin' fuck what you wanted! Get!
Zoltan Chivay|Next time I'll rip your fuckin' legs off and shove them up your arse till you've toes for teeth!
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|Lice eat you, you mangy dwarf!
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Let it go, Jaret. Come on, we need another place to hunker down the night.
Novigrad Thug Weak 03|Maybe we oughta try the King of Beggars?
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|What the--? Look at me. I look like a ploughin' beggar to you? I'm a citizen temporarily short of a permanent dwellin', naught else.
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Wanna go on lookin', be my guest. I'm goin' to see the king.
<|endoftext|>
Zoltan Chivay|Geeeralt! In the nick of time, as always!
Geralt|Zoltan, with your boot to someone's ass, as always.
Geralt|Who were those men?
Zoltan Chivay|Local color. I wasn't gone more'n a moment. Long enough for them to turn our home into theirs!
Zoltan Chivay|All right, time for some spring cleanin', I've got to boot 'em all out. Care to join me?
Geralt|With pleasure.
Zoltan Chivay|Hear that? I'll give 'em hell, I will!
Geralt|Let's go upstairs.
Zoltan Chivay|Ah, reminds me of our days of yore, eh?
Geralt|Yeah, almost like we never left Vergen.
<|endoftext|>
Zoltan Chivay|I'm pleased. That went well.
Zoltan Chivay|Now we can greet each other like the gods ordained! Ages, pal!
Geralt|Hey, Zoltan. You look good.
Zoltan Chivay|Trainin' plenty lately. What with the war on, no Mahakaman mead to be found, but Redanian lager's standin' in just fine.
Zoltan Chivay|You, though - you've withered a bit. Somethin' worryin' you?
Geralt|Where's Dandelion?
Zoltan Chivay|Hah! Like to know that meself! Maybe he could explain what the hell's goin' on!
Zoltan Chivay|I just barely returned, as you saw. Expectin' to come home to a hot leg o' boar and some cold ale. What do I find instead? A shitestorm.
Zoltan Chivay|Dandelion gone, the tavern chock full of bums. Haven't a clue what happened.
Geralt|Hmm… Let's look around. Might find something that'll put us on his trail.
Zoltan Chivay|Prime idea. I say we start on the ground floor. It's where he sat and wrote.
Geralt|It's about Ciri.
Geralt|I know she came to Novigrad. Might still be here.
Zoltan Chivay|You mean, she's come back? I'll be damned. I wonder if I'd recognize her… How many years is it now? Six? Seven?
Zoltan Chivay|But what'd she be doin' here?
Geralt|Hiding, probably. She might be in danger.
Zoltan Chivay|See her in your dreams?
Geralt|Couple times. Her, and the Wild Hunt.
Zoltan Chivay|Ooh… not good.
Geralt|Not at all. But I know she came here and contacted Dandelion.
Zoltan Chivay|We've a wee problem, then…
Geralt|I'm looking for Ciri.
Geralt|There's a few things…
Zoltan Chivay|Let me guess: Triss? Yennefer, perchance?
Geralt|Triss and I… talked. Cleared some things up.
Geralt|As for Yennefer, well…
Zoltan Chivay|So you found her! Hah! Need to tell me all about it!
Geralt|I will, some other time. Got something a tinge more important to take care of now.
Zoltan Chivay|Meaning?
Geralt|Ugh. Got some problems. Rather not burden you.
Zoltan Chivay|Fuck off, Geralt. Need to spill your guts to me, now.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Hmm… this the lute he got from the elves of Dol Blathanna?
Zoltan Chivay|Aye. Must've been in a great rush to leave it behind.
Geralt|The faculty of Oxenfurt University is honored to grant Julian Alfred Pankratz, viscount de Lettenhove, the title of Master of the Seven Liberal Arts.
Zoltan Chivay|Keep forgettin' he's got that damn fool name.
Geralt|Annual Balladry Contest, Silver Laurel, awarded to Master Dandelion.
Zoltan Chivay|Prince Hereward himself did the honors.
Zoltan Chivay|And the feast afterwards, to celebrate the laureates! Dandelion taught a swine to yodel, and I… ah, another time.
Geralt|From the finest vineyards, every last one.
Zoltan Chivay|No one knows the fruit of the fruit of the vine like Dandelion.
Zoltan Chivay|Ahah! A note from a grateful muse!
Geralt|Reading someone else's letters? Tsk, tsk.
Zoltan Chivay|…my visage red and hot… I plunged into purest ecstasy, imbibing its nectar…
Zoltan Chivay|… your dexterous digits on my soul's yearning chords.
Geralt|Hm… Nose is too small.
Zoltan Chivay|Aye, and the sword's too big!
Zoltan Chivay|By the bye, is that how it's done? Killin' a wyvern?
Geralt|Hm… Technique's not quite right, but you gotta admit he's doing it with gusto.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Hmm… Ten barrels of Toussaint dry, five cases of Sodden triple mead… Hmm - nothing here.
Zoltan Chivay|No, no, no! That's exactly what we're lookin' for!
Zoltan Chivay|It's his planner.
Geralt|Hah, Dandelion and planning? Good one.
Geralt|Besides, anything he wrote here - probably had a special system, chaos only he could ever decipher. Actually, in the past, sometimes not even that.
Zoltan Chivay|Give 'im a chance, might not be that bad.
Zoltan Chivay|Seems when he inherited this fine establishment, it came with some fine responsibilities. Bookkeeping among 'em.
Zoltan Chivay|He also made a habit of notin' down the times of his meetings - official and private. So, who'd he been seein' of late…?
Zoltan Chivay|Ah! Here it is! Hmm, seems he's only been meetin' women of late, the dog.
Geralt|Zoltan, please. You really wanna track down the women Dandelion's been wooing? Most likely all angry women by now.
Zoltan Chivay|Got any better ideas? 'Sides, Dandelion's a babbler. They're sure to know somethin' of his doin's.
Zoltan Chivay|Hm… We should divide these somehow… Perhaps… Ah, fuck it.
Zoltan Chivay|I'll ask the lasses on my half, you interrogate the ones on yours. Suit you?
Geralt|Zoltan, wait. This is in verse.
Zoltan Chivay|And you figure that's unnatural because…?
Geralt|Wonderful. Meet me back here when you're done. Share our findings…
Zoltan Chivay|Right y'are. Need to do a wee bit o' tidyin' 'fore I go, can't stomach the idea of comin' back to this mess. And you'd be wise to read your bit 'fore you scurry off.
Zoltan Chivay|If ye need anythin', I'll be next door.
Geralt|Hmm… Not a bad idea. Dandelion's pretty loose-lipped, might've blabbed something to a lady friend that'll put us on his trail…
Zoltan Chivay|That's what I'm countin' on.
Geralt|Seems Dandelion's taking the tavern business seriously.
Zoltan Chivay|If ye only knew. Gives it everythin'. Not seen him this obsessed ever.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Though well she knows the touch of silk and lace, she shuns not straw when gripped in lust’s embrace.
Zoltan Chivay|Molly. Keeps things tidy for the Baroness la Valette.
Geralt|A baroness within reach, and he settled for a chambermaid?
Zoltan Chivay|Dandelion's not one to judge folk by their station - you know that. Like he says, "In the alcove, we're all equals."
Geralt|Yeah, guess a true poet observes life in all its aspects, examines it from all perspectives…
Geralt|If I didn't know him better, I'd say he was jealous about this Marabella.
Zoltan Chivay|Argh, doubt it. Former pupil, and, well, the tales he told me 'bout her…
Geralt|Doubt I want to hear them…
Zoltan Chivay|Probably better off not. Things 'tween them took a turn for the strange at some point…
Geralt|Meaning?
Zoltan Chivay|She had him wearin' mummer's costumes, took to callin' him Christian, referrin' to herself as Anastasia…
Geralt|Hm, truly perverse…
Zoltan Chivay|Ye dinnae ken the half of it! Called 'im her stallion, once - 'course the fool took it as a compliment... till she pulled a bit and reins outta her cupboard. Ho ho! Poor bastard fled out the window.
Geralt|Vespula... Name rings a bell... She threw his knickers out the window?
Zoltan Chivay|That's her.
Geralt|Hollered something about him being a scoundrel with a voice like a consumptive pheasant?
Zoltan Chivay|That's her.
Geralt|Threw flower pots at him?
Zoltan Chivay|Guess old flames never die.
Geralt|Like a rose abashed of its crimson hue, fair Rosa would sink into humors blue. She shunned her lessons in civility to swing her Dwarf with agility.
Geralt|Dwarf? Never suspected he'd be so humble.
Zoltan Chivay|Heheh, Dwarf's what Rosa var Attre named her gwyhyr. Well chosen, eh?
Zoltan Chivay|Her da's a Nilfgaardian aristocrat with the imperial legation. Commissioned Dandelion to tutor Rosa and her sister in the art of rhetoric, but wee Rosa preferred swordplay.
Geralt|How dare she reject the great bard in favor of a common swordmaster?
Zoltan Chivay|More than one, it seems. Week on week we get fresh gossip 'bout her thrashin' another instructor. So bad he resigns.
Zoltan Chivay|Word has it her da's now looking to hire her next victim, I mean, instructor.
Geralt|All right. But var Attre? Her dad happen to be the Nilfgaardian ambassador?
Zoltan Chivay|He is. You know 'im?
Geralt|Wouldn't say that. Had a brief conversation with him at the palace in Vizima.
Zoltan Chivay|Well, then you've a good notion of the kind of bloke he is. Commissioned Dandelion to tutor Rosa and her sister in the art of rhetoric, but wee Rosa preferred swordplay.
Geralt|A figure most rare, her nature dual. Look deep in her eyes, or be made a fool.
Geralt|Well, well… Seems fascinated with this one…
Zoltan Chivay|Errr, not without reason… Never been much for elven women meself, but this one's exceptional. Dare say Francesca Findabair'd be jealous.
Geralt|You wanna take this one, then?
Zoltan Chivay|Nah, you can have her.
Geralt|Why?
Zoltan Chivay|You see… elven beauty's like a young Beauclair wine. Whereas I prefer vodka straight up.
Geralt|Well, know about all I wanted to know. Thanks for your help.
Geralt|Still here? Looking for something?
Zoltan Chivay|Ah, just checking to see that everythin's in place. Buggers mighta hauled somethin' off for pawnin'…
Geralt|Actually, glad you're still here. Wanted to ask you about someone.
Zoltan Chivay|Well, don't just stand there. Read - we might learn somethin'.
Geralt|Had another question about the planner.
Zoltan Chivay|Aye, aye, I'm all ears.
<|endoftext|>
Edna Var Attre|Who are you? Why are you here? Answer this instant or I'll summon the guards!
Geralt|Uh, sorry to sneak in, miss. I'm Geralt, a friend of the bard Dandelion…
Edna Var Attre|Geralt of Rivia? The famed witcher of the ballads?
Novigrad Guard 03|What're you doing here, vagrant?! How'd you get in?! I let no one in the front, milady, I swear it on the Great Sun!
Edna Var Attre|Not a word. I'll handle this.
Edna Var Attre|Hold your tongue, sir. This... This is Frederic Francis de Bergerac. My new swordplay instructor, correct? Show him to the training room. I shall join him shortly.
Novigrad Guard 03|But milady, he's a witcher! Said so himself, back by the gates!
Edna Var Attre|Captain, do you truly believe Rosa var Attre would train with random clods calling themselves swordmasters? No, the var Attres demand the very best. Thus, we've hired a witcher.
Edna Var Attre|Take him to the training room. Now.
Novigrad Guard 03|As you say, miss.
Novigrad Guard 03|But miss, he just claimed to be the cook! He's a cheat, he is!
Edna Var Attre|Hahah, see, Frederic? Did I not warn you not to jest with the guards? They haven't any sense of humor whatever.
Edna Var Attre|Now take Master de Bergerac to the training room. Quickly.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Rosa var Attre's expecting me. Supposed to give her lessons in swordplay.
Novigrad Guard 03|Come with me. Miss Rosa awaits.
Novigrad Guard 03|What do you want?
Geralt|Wanna see Rosa var Attre.
Novigrad Guard 03|Oh, mate, if you only knew what I want... Miss Rosa don't see just anybody.
Geralt|I'm Geralt of Rivia, a witcher.
Novigrad Guard 03|Soon as Miss Rosa turns into a striga, I'm sure her papa'll send for you. But she's not showin' any symptoms yet, so I venture you're not needed. On your way, now.
Geralt|I'm the new cook.
Novigrad Guard 03|And them pointy things stickin' out behind you, they your cleavers?
Novigrad Guard 02|Away with you, vagrant.
Geralt|Nothing. Wrong house.
Novigrad Guard 03|What's this? Didn't hear me tell you we ain't lookin' for no cook? Sod off!
Novigrad Guard 03|Thanks, we ain't lookin' for no witcher.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|I'm not actually your swordplay instructor.
Rosa Var Attre|Really. Then who are you? And how on earth did you get in?!
Geralt|Am I imagining things? Didn't we just have this conversation? In the garden?
Rosa Var Attre|The garden…? Yes, yes! In the garden.
Rosa Var Attre|So, what was it you said? Why are you here?
Geralt|Came to ask about your rhetoric tutor, Dandelion.
Rosa Var Attre|Rhetoric tutor? Good one. That is why papa hired him, but not at all what the bard had in mind. He mostly played his lute and sang for us. I believe he thought he was wooing…
Geralt|Mean he wasn't? But you had some sort of... relationship?
Rosa Var Attre|If you call him chasing after me a relationship… Even so, there was nothing between us.
Rosa Var Attre|Seems my sister's had a bit of fun at our expense. But enough chatter! Stand and fight! I demand a rematch!
Geralt|Before I ask… Gotta admit - you do pretty well with a sword. One pointer - don't expose your left flank when you dodge.
Rosa Var Attre|Oh, I know, terrible habit. Can't seem to get rid of it. I'd hoped to find someone in Novigrad who could help me to do so.
Rosa Var Attre|Buuuut - don't you dare try to dazzle me with advice. Already admitted you're not here to give me lessons.
Geralt|I'm a witcher. I'm looking f--
Rosa Var Attre|A witcher! That's splendid! I always wanted to meet a witcher! This is so exciting!
Geralt|Uh, what's so exciting about it?
Rosa Var Attre|Living on the edge, tracking, then facing down beasts, sleeping under the stars! Oh, it must be wonderful!
Geralt|Mm, try fighting a zeugl while up to your neck in sewage… Nothing quite like it.
Rosa Var Attre|Not one of the high points, I suppose… Wait, weren't you about to ask me something?
Geralt|Incredibly. But we oughta discuss that another time.
Geralt|Guards aren't up to muster. Let me right in - just had to tell them I was here to teach you swordplay.
Rosa Var Attre|I told father they're a band of imbeciles! But if you're not the instructor, then who exactly are you? Have you come to rob? Kill? Speak!
Geralt|Neither, so whaddaya say we stay calm.
Rosa Var Attre|Well fought. You're much better than the last one.
Rosa Var Attre|Is there not one competent instructor in this entire city?
<|endoftext|>
Rosa Var Attre|Well, if you're not an instructor, you should certainly be one. Fancy giving me a few private lessons?
Geralt|Can't rightly refuse a request from a lady.
Edna Var Attre|What are you two lovebirds whispering about?
Rosa Var Attre|You asked about my relationship with Dandelion? Well, here's the mix-up's mastermind: Edna var Attre, the greatest mischief-maker north or south of the Yaruga!
Geralt|Sorry, you lost me...
Rosa Var Attre|You're not the first to be confused… I'll explain.
Rosa Var Attre|Edna sent Dandelion some love letters. She signed my name. Conceited as he is, naturally he fell for it.
Rosa Var Attre|I was left to repel the aging bard's advances.
Edna Var Attre|Rosa, I had the best of intentions, you know that! I felt you needed help taking the first step… You blushed every time he sang a ballad.
Rosa Var Attre|He'll next sing at your funeral if you don't stop it right now!
Geralt|Calm down, ladies. No poet's worth two sisters nipping at each other's throats.
Rosa Var Attre|Especially not this one…
Geralt|Listen. I just wanna know one thing - either of you seen Dandelion lately?
Rosa Var Attre|Edna might have. I certainly have not.
Edna Var Attre|My dear sister, I would never spend time alone with a man for whom you burn with a secret passion.
Rosa Var Attre|Burn with passion? For one who incessantly praises another woman's talents? Afraid I've more sense than that!
Geralt|Been a pleasure, but I've got stuff to take care of.
Edna Var Attre|Exceedingly nice to meet you. Please come again.
Rosa Var Attre|Well? Can I expect any more lessons in future?
Geralt|Sorry, Rosa, afraid I can't at the moment.
Rosa Var Attre|Farewell, then. Oh, payment for your time.
Geralt|Awfully convincing, miss. Wonder where you learned it. Name the time and place.
Rosa Var Attre|How's here, tomorrow? Same time as today?
Geralt|See you then.
Rosa Var Attre|See you, master witcher.
Geralt|Who'd Dandelion sing about? Know anything about her?
Rosa Var Attre|I believe she's a poetess or a trobairitz... Very skilled and exceptionally talented, of course.
Rosa Var Attre|But who knows! The "bard" might've invented her just to make us jealous. Pitiful chorister.
Edna Var Attre|I'd say it worked. You've gone all red in the face just talking about it.
Rosa Var Attre|Your face'll be red when I scratch your eyes out!
Geralt|This woman - not a local, right?
Rosa Var Attre|Hmm... I seem to remember him praising her "melodious Koviri accent"…
Edna Var Attre|Makes sense - he referred to her as "Callonetta" a few times. Bizarre names are common in Kovir.
Geralt|Gotta ask Zoltan about this Callonetta.
Geralt|Dandelion act any different lately? Notice anything strange?
Rosa Var Attre|Strange? Not really…
Edna Var Attre|It's no use, Geralt. She's so enamored she'd hardly notice if he turned into a werewolf.
Rosa Var Attre|Edna!
Edna Var Attre|What? You needn't pretend he followed convention! Remember when he took us to the cemetery?
Geralt|Rhetoric lessons in a cemetery? Unusual even for Dandelion.
Edna Var Attre|We set out to visit the graves of celebrated Oxenfurt professors. He ended up quizzing us about Margrave Henckel.
Geralt|Who?
Edna Var Attre|Eccentric old coot. Died recently.
Rosa Var Attre|He'd apparently been an important and generous patron of the arts as a young man.
Geralt|What're two young Nilfgaardian aristocrats doing in Novigrad?
Rosa Var Attre|Dying of boredom.
Edna Var Attre|Papa's a diplomat. He also has many business dealings in Novigrad. He's a member of the Trade Corporation.
Rosa Var Attre|Takes us along everywhere he goes, and must then find us new tutors in each spot.
Edna Var Attre|And so in Novigrad the task fell to the poet Dandelion, Rosa's betrothed.
Rosa Var Attre|Edna!
Geralt|Bet sophisticated young ladies like you know a bunch about politics.
Rosa Var Attre|We've picked up a few things. What would you like to know?
Geralt|Changing subjects...
Geralt|Wonder how the war's going. Any outcome looming?
Edna Var Attre|Papa says much depends on Radovid, and on who captures Novigrad first.
Geralt|What's Novigrad got to do with it? Free city - never taken sides, always stayed out of conflicts…
Rosa Var Attre|Oh, even children know Novigrad's home to the world's largest fleet.
Edna Var Attre|And they say the city treasury's bursting with enough to equip two armies.
Geralt|Emperor continuing to push north. Courtiers must be ecstatic…
Edna Var Attre|His confidants must be. But papa says that's not likely to last much longer.
Geralt|Why not?
Rosa Var Attre|Papa says the war's disrupting trade. And people are tired of financing the emperor's adventures.
Geralt|Quiet!
Edna Var Attre|Ooh, now that's a mentor! Strong and decisive... Perhaps it's time I took take up swordplay?
Geralt|Wait a minute: mean to say Dandelion mixed you two up?
Edna Var Attre|On occasion, yes. But then Rosa would quickly set him straight.
Rosa Var Attre|If you'd shut your catty mouth for a moment, dear little sister, I could explain.
Geralt|Hang on. So it was you in the garden.
Edna Var Attre|Hahah, of course it was me. Why, did Rosa try to play you for a fool?
Rosa Var Attre|Don't be mad. We've done this since we were children. People have always mistaken us for one another.
Geralt|Take it Dandelion did too…?
Geralt|Can someone please explain what this is all about? Which of you met with Dandelion?
Rosa Var Attre|No need to get angry, instructor. I'll explain.
Geralt|Sorry, gotta say no. Schedule's packed just now.
Rosa Var Attre|As you wish.
Rosa Var Attre|My, you really are a lousy swordsman. In fact, believe I could teach you a thing or two…
Geralt|Nice of you to offer, miss. Very. Afraid I have to say no.
Geralt|Not sure I can possibly pass up lessons from such a skilled young lady…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Take this coin and leave.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|That ain't how it works. Vespula's to pay… or be taught a lesson.
Geralt|Already given her a verbal reprimand. Now go, before I teach you a lesson.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Come on… Gold's gold.
Geralt|Vespula's got someone else's protection now.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Really. Whose'd that be?
Geralt|The King of Beggars'. Made a deal with Junior. This is his turf now.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Didn't hear nothin' about that.
Geralt|But you have heard what Bedlam does to people who cross him? Or you need a demonstration?
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|C'mon, Fritz… Boss wants it that way, it's how it's gotta be.
Geralt|Mine. Offered her a better rate.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|All right. So let's see if you're a good bargain, or just cheap shit.
Geralt|Go. Now.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Now listen… You might have two swords, but there's four of us…
Geralt|Yeah… Four men. Collecting tribute from one washerwoman. Don't think I have much to fear.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Best think again.
Vespula|I will get you every last copper - with interest. Gimme a week, please!
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Whoreson's no banker. He's an honest man - you pay on time, you get protection. You don't pay…
Vespula|Help!
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|What you hollerin' for, stupid wench! What you hopin' for, a knight in shinin' armor?
Geralt|Close enough.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Keep outta this, grayhead. Not your concern.
Vespula|Swine!
Vespula|The witcher'll burn you!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Don't know if you remember - we've met.
Vespula|I don't-- Wait, wait! I know you! You're that witcher I near clobbered with a vase when… Well…
Geralt|When you kicked Dandelion out… through the balcony. Actually, he's the reason I'm here. Know where he is?
Vespula|Probably out whorin', that hoarse pheasant, that lyin' scoundrel!
Geralt|Ouch… What'd he do to get your goat?
Vespula|Same thing as ever! Prize bullshitter came back, sayin' it was till death do we part this time. And? No more'n a week passed before I spotted him in Harborside, strollin' with some trollop on his arm!
Vespula|Twas the last straw. All those questions 'bout the washerwomen at the bathhouse, then this. I beat 'im black and blue and threw 'im out on his ear!
Geralt|This woman he was with in the harbor… Who was she?
Vespula|Claimed she was his niece from Kovir - hah! Whore-vir, more likely!
Vespula|Corset so tight her eyes were poppin' out her head. His too, come to think of it! An artist or a whore - doesn't much matter as they're one and the same…
Geralt|An artist?
Vespula|Or a whore.
Geralt|Apparently Dandelion was seeing a trobairitz, a blonde, most likely.
Vespula|That's the one! Wait, what was her name… Callonetta! Sounds like an artist, a foreigner and a whore - three in one.
Geralt|Dandelion ask you about other washerwomen? Not terribly subtle, even for him.
Vespula|Maybe he likes 'em sudsy?
Geralt|Uh, maybe… But what'd he ask about - exactly?
Vespula|Oh, this and that, really… What it's like at the bathhouse, have I got any friends there, what're their workin' hours…
Vespula|I dunno, maybe he's lookin' to hire one for his tavern. Maybe I got all in a huff for no reason.
Geralt|Thanks for your help.
Geralt|Listen - when I find Dandelion… anything I should tell him?
Vespula|No! I mean… Tell him he's a two-faced snake, but… it would be nice if he dropped by.
Geralt|Relax… It'll come out in the wash.
Vespula|Course it will. Just gotta soak it in white vinegar - but that's not my point.
Vespula|Junior shan't forgive me. Either I close up shop meself, or he'll burn me down.
Geralt|Sorry… Didn't think about that.
Vespula|A woman's lot… Men have their fun, and we're stuck with the mess.
Vespula|Oh well… I suppose I must move to Oxenfurt. Professors need clean undergarments, too.
Geralt|Whaddaya think… Where could Dandelion be?
Geralt|Explain something, if you don't mind… You say I took Dandelion out whoring?
Vespula|So he said. Claimed I was his one and only, but he fell in with the wrong folk - you and that dwarf who always looks like a cow licked him. Said you two were a bad example - wine, women…
Geralt|… song. He pick that habit up from us, too? Gotta have a word with him…
Vespula|Thank you, oh thank you! To think there're men who'll help a stranger outta the kindness of their hearts…
Geralt|Not entirely outta kindness, and you're not entirely a stranger.
Vespula|What're you…? Oh, I know you! You're that witcher took Dandelion out whorin'… Jerald, right?
Geralt|Not Jerald… Geralt.
Vespula|Oh… Dreadful sorry.
Vespula|Covered in blood - all of it! So much work, for naught.
Geralt|No need to thank me. It was nothing.
Vespula|Sorry… Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful, but… Everything I had… I just lost.
Vespula|You're back… Honestly don't know why! Claimed you'd defend me, then ran for your life?! Pfff, some hero you are!
Vespula|Id' 'ave done better if you'd never butted in! Might've parleyed with those rogues, agreed somethin'… This way? All I had's been smashed to pieces!
Geralt|Come on. Far as I remember, I didn't make you any promises.
Vespula|Oh, typical! You men always say that! Leave us women to deal with the consequences.
Vespula|Argh, damn it all. I'll move meself to Oxenfurt. Professors' pantaloons need washin', too.
Geralt|Got nothing in my defense. Apologize - it's all I can do.
Vespula|Apologize? Apologize? What's that get me when me whole enterprise is gone, finished?

Voorhis|Greetings, witcher. Must admit it's curious to see you here. I don't quite believe in coincidences.
Luiza La Valette|Geralt of Rivia. Slayer of monsters… and my son.
Geralt|You're right, General. My visit's no accident. I'm looking for someone.
Luiza La Valette|There's no one here who wishes to see you. Captain, this man is not to enter. Forgive me, Morvran, but I've lost my appetite for the races.
Voorhis|Kill a woman's son, then appear at her doorstep? My, my, I thought witchers had better survival skills than that.
Voorhis|I fear your information's out of date. Molly no longer works here.
Geralt|Baroness fired her?
Voorhis|Quite the contrary. Molly decided she no longer wished to serve.
Voorhis|After Aryan's demise, Louisa's nephew came to pay his respects. Got one glance of Molly, and - well, they wed soon after.
Voorhis|They now await his inheritance. With the baroness' son dead, the estate will go to the nephew… and Lady l'Attard, known until recently simply as Molly.
Geralt|All right, so where'll I find the newly-minted Lady l'Attard?
Voorhis|Our dear little Molly has a new passion - horse racing. To my knowledge she should be at Countess Vegelbud's villa right now.
Voorhis|That's exactly where I'm going. Since you stripped me of Louisa's company, perhaps you'd agree to come along?
Geralt|Think I can find my own way to the Vegelbud home.
Voorhis|Very well… Perhaps I can convince you to join me later at the races. I shall keep an eye out for you.
Geralt|Well, if Molly'll be there…
Voorhis|On our way, then.
Geralt|Gotta wonder if Molly fell for the nephew or his inheritance.
Voorhis|We cannot know that just yet. But I'd wager she has strong feelings for both.
Geralt|Seem to know who Molly is. You also know she doesn't work here anymore… Know where I can find her, maybe?
Voorhis|This time of day? Probably sipping punch and considering which horse to bet on.
Geralt|Not in the mood for jokes.
Voorhis|I jest you not.
Luiza La Valette|Geralt of Rivia at my doorstep? Surely, this is no chance encounter?
Geralt|Greetings, Baroness. Greetings, General. You're right. I'm here for a reason.
Luiza La Valette|There's no mistaking you. But, for etiquette's sake, Mary Louisa la Valette.
Luiza La Valette|An imperial general and a witcher meet… and know each other. Surprising.
Geralt|We've met before…
Voorhis|And how! Imagine this, Louisa - the emperor desired a chat with the witcher. I, too, was fortunate enough to meet him then.
Luiza La Valette|Hm... So Geralt of Rivia now works for Emperor Emhyr... Interesting... Has var Emreis sent you to rid Novigrad of monsters?
Luiza La Valette|My maid-servant. I'm afraid she's currently at the home of my dear friend Patricia Vegelbud.
Voorhis|Perhaps Geralt could accompany us. He could speak with Molly at the races.
Luiza La Valette|Is that something you'd consider, witcher? Care to partake of some sophisticated diversion?
Geralt|Yeah, we had an opportunity to, uh… talk when the emperor summoned me to Vizima.
Luiza La Valette|Had you run afoul of var Emreis? No, you'd be long dead if that were so. It seems then that you share some interests…
Luiza La Valette|But I shan't question you out of doors. Will you accept my invitation, tell me what brings you here?
Geralt|This Baroness la Valette's villa?
Temerian Guard 01|Shouldn't interest you. The baroness don't mingle with just anyone.
Geralt|Don't worry. I'm here to see her chambermaid, Molly.
Temerian Guard 01|Out of the way. Baroness is ridin' out. Begone.
Geralt|Looking for a girl named Molly, heard she works here.
<|endoftext|>
Luiza La Valette|My father owned a similar estate in Brugge. As a young girl, I'd travel there often to ride.
Voorhis|Shall we look at the horses? Do you like horses, Geralt?
Geralt|I guess so. Called every horse I've had Roach.
Voorhis|The gray mare is Cantarella. Sired by Cahir, the champion from Vole.
Geralt|Gray's a nice color. For horses, too.
Voorhis|My coin's on the black stallion - Nemrod. Purest Nilfgaardian stock.
Geralt|Surprised he didn't salute you, general.
Geralt|Seem to know your horses.
Luiza La Valette|"Know" is not the word. Morvran's a true expert.
Voorhis|I find them to be far more honest than men.
Voorhis|Must say I'm curious how you manage in the saddle, witcher.
Geralt|Mostly just try to stay in it.
Voorhis|What would you say to a little race?
Geralt|Not what I came here for.
Voorhis|Don't make me beg, witcher. Tell you what - win, and I shall give you my finest saddle. Made in Nilfgaard proper of beautifully tanned leather.
Geralt|Why not. Wouldn't mind seeing if your knowledge of horses translates into riding skills.
Luiza La Valette|Well said. So, which steed do you choose, witcher?
Geralt|The gray mare looks nimble. Besides, knew a man named Cahir once. I'll go with her.
Luiza La Valette|I'll not race, however I will wager on a winner. The gray mare's my choice.
Voorhis|Cantarella for me, then.
Voorhis|I see no point in delaying this. Let's begin.
Voorhis|In that case, I shall try my luck on the Zerrikanian bay.
Voorhis|Nemrod - I fear I can choose no other.
Luiza La Valette|I'll not ride with you, but I shall bet on a steed. Nemrod will win, no matter the rider.
Geralt|The black's your favorite? Let's see what a Nilfgaardian stallion's made of.
Geralt|Radovid's encamped nearby. Redanian chestnut might want to impress its king.
Geralt|Heard tales of Zerrikanian horses. I'll ride the bay.
Geralt|I'd rather resolve what I have to with Molly.
Voorhis|Very well, I shan't insist. The attractive one - that's Molly. Speak to her. The baroness and I will place our wagers. You can then ride back to Novigrad with us if you wish.
Geralt|Know anything about the chestnut or the bay?
Voorhis|The chestnut is Thunderbolt, a pureblood Redanian. Gallant steed, but too headstrong for my taste, difficult to control.
Voorhis|And the bay hails from Zerrikania. Lord de Volte acquired him recently. I know little about him, though Zerrikanians are reputed to have incredible stamina.
Geralt|Is Molly a horse?
Voorhis|Pardon?
Geralt|I did come here to see Molly, after all.
Luiza La Valette|Patience, witcher. She ought to arrive soon. I asked Molly to join us as soon as she was done with her chores. She shouldn't be long now.
Geralt|All depends what you asked her to do, m'lady. But I don't really have a choice - I'll wait.
Luiza La Valette|What a thrill! A beautiful victory!
Geralt|Thanks.
Voorhis|For one for whom every horse is a Roach, you carry yourself exquisitely in the saddle. My congratulations.
Voorhis|That… is yours.
Geralt|Now, could I talk to your chambermaid, m'lady?
Luiza La Valette|Ah! Yes, Molly. That is why you came here, after all.
Luiza La Valette|The portly young woman. That's her.
Voorhis|Speak to her. And you must find us when you're ready to return to Novigrad. We'd be delighted to join you for the journey.
Luiza La Valette|Victory!
Geralt|Great race. Quite the intuition, baroness.
Luiza La Valette|It rarely disappoints me.
Luiza La Valette|Oof, so close!
Geralt|The general's not only knowledgeable, but skilled. Congratulations.
Voorhis|Thank you. It was a good race against a worthy opponent.
Luiza La Valette|Soothing, the scent of the freshly cut lawn.
Voorhis|Not all appreciate it. The races are a privilege of the wealthy.
Luiza La Valette|Some of the wealthy are too occupied minding their wealth to appreciate any form of diversion.
Voorhis|Fortunately, you do not number among them, m'Lady.
Luiza La Valette|Perhaps because the imperial army seized most of my wealth?
Voorhis|We've arrived.
Voorhis|We meet again, witcher.
Geralt|Yeah, managed to get here. Truth be told, hard to miss an estate this grand.
Voorhis|I had hoped to have a contest between gentlemen.
Geralt|Forgive me.
Luiza La Valette|Oh, Morvran, stop harping. Geralt, should you need to speak to Molly, she is over there, by the mounts.
Voorhis|We will return to Novigrad shortly. Would you join us for the journey? We would be delighted.
Geralt|I might. Thank you.
<|endoftext|>
Voorhis|I must say of all the creatures in this region, I find steeds most intriguing. Horses interest you at all, witcher?
Geralt|All the same to me. Call each one I ride Roach.
Voorhis|Strange…
Voorhis|The gray is Cantarella. Sired by Cahir, the champion from Vole.
Geralt|Yeah... Gray's a good color. Even looks good on horses.
Voorhis|My coin's on the black stallion - Nemrod. Purest Nilfgaardian stock.
Geralt|Surprised he didn't salute you, general.
Geralt|Not what I came here for.
Voorhis|Don't make me beg, witcher. Tell you what - win, and I shall give you my finest saddle. Made in Nilfgaard proper of beautifully tanned leather.
Geralt|Hm, why not. Wouldn't mind seeing if your knowledge of horses translates into riding skills.
Voorhis|Hah! Splendid. In that case, you must choose a mount.
Geralt|Think I'll take the gray mare.
Voorhis|The horses are saddled. Let's begin.
Geralt|I'll ride Nemrod. Pit a Nilfgaardian stallion against a Nilfgaardian general.
Geralt|Hmm... Redanian chestnut looks promising.
Geralt|Think I'll give you a run on the Zerrikanian bay.
Geralt|I'd rather resolve things with Molly.
Voorhis|Well, there she is. See the slim young woman? Resolve what you must. I shall play the horses for a time. If you wish, we can ride back to the city together.
Voorhis|I shall be here for a time. Find me if you'd like to ride back to the city together.
Voorhis|Ah, look! Lady l'Attard has just arrived.
Geralt|Who?
Voorhis|The woman formerly known as Molly. There she stands.
Geralt|Right... Thanks.
Voorhis|I see you managed to find the place.
Geralt|Not that hard. It's not exactly a small, concealed hovel.
Voorhis|We've arrived.
Geralt|Nice place.
Voorhis|Acknowledge it, witcher. I'm the superior rider.
Geralt|I'll acknowledge your Roach proved faster. Congratulations.
Geralt|The Roach I chose put in a nice run.
Voorhis|Exceptional. I've not lost a race in a while. I congratulate you.
Voorhis|That… is yours.
Voorhis|I had hoped to have a contest between gentlemen.
Geralt|Forgive me.
Voorhis|Ah well, perhaps another time.
Voorhis|Ah, at last, Molly appears. She's over there, by the horses.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|These packages... Any chance they were trunks, travel cases? And this girl - possibly a trobairitz?
Molly|Yes, yes! Now I remember: she's a traveling performer, sailed in from Kovir… Talented family, innit?
Geralt|Exceptionally. And very loving as well, I'm sure.
Molly|If you only knew! Dandelion even wrote a poem for her… "To My Dearest Callonetta," or somesuch. Oh, to have a brother like that!
Geralt|You do realize Dandelion doesn't have a sister.
Molly|Sure he does! Saw her meself! Funny, she don't look like him at all… blonde, for starters. Maybe they've different fathers?
Geralt|Mhm. Different mothers, too.
Molly|Maybe… But you could see he cares for her, looks after her, the way he carried her packages and…
Geralt|Know where I can find her - Dandelion's sister?
Molly|Oh no. Whenever I asked Dandelion when we'd visit her, he'd grow all quiet, then change the subject.
Geralt|Any chance you remember your last conversation with Dandelion?
Molly|Course! He came to borrow some coin for a barge…
Geralt|What? Why'd he need a barge?
Molly|To take me on a romantic cruise, of the canals, by the light of the moon!
Molly|Said there'd be strawberries and that wine with the bubbles, and he'd sing me arias… But… I've not seen him since.
Geralt|I'm under the impression Dandelion thinks you still serve the la Valettes…
Molly|Oh, that's 'cause I never told him I stopped. Didn't want him to treat me any different…
Geralt|And your husband has nothing against it... your old friendship?
Molly|Course not! Sweetiekins couldn't be happier that Dandelion's raisin' me sophistication.
Geralt|Thanks, Molly.
Molly|Wait… before you go… I've got a request.
Molly|Dandelion told me once he'd show me his etchings, but he never did. And I'd so like to see 'em…
Geralt|Won't be too hard to convince him. He loves showing off those etchings - to anyone he can.
Molly|Oh, that's wonderful! Thanks, and good luck to you on your search!
Molly|I'm Molly, m'lord. Wished to see me?
Geralt|Call me Geralt.
Molly|Geralt? That Geralt? The one Dandelion's rescued time and time again?
Geralt|Mhm. Wouldn't be here if not for Dandelion.
Molly|Told me all about your adventures. How he'd ready you for battle with his songs, how he tamed the kayran by playin' his lute…
Geralt|I meant that literally. Dandelion's why I'm here - came to ask you about him. Know where he might be?
Molly|No… sadly, I haven't got a clue. We've not seen each other in ages.
Molly|The baroness don't approve of our acquaintance. Says Dandelion's a good-for-nothin' layabout - can you imagine?!
Molly|But… maybe his sister could help you? Such a nice girl…
Molly|Ever since I became Lady la Attard, it's been nothin' but balls, banquets and other such… what's it… congregations. Awful tiring, all this…
Geralt|That's right… except it's the other way around. I'm always saving him.
Molly|Mean to say it weren't Dandelion saved you in Flotsam by severin' your noose with an arrow from a hundred paces?
Geralt|What? Dandelion couldn't… Er, never mind. Any idea where our master archer might be at the moment?
Geralt|Who do you favor, m'lady?
Molly|Can't decide between the black stallion and the gray mare. Keep goin' back and forth, back and forth.
Molly|Sorry. Don't believe we've been introduced.
Geralt|I'm Geralt.
Voorhis|Ah, Geralt, there you are. Shall we return together?
Geralt|Gladly. It's a long way to Novigrad. Road oughta seem shorter with some company.
Voorhis|I'd say the same. Well then, let's go.
Geralt|No. Actually came to say goodbye. I'll get back on my own somehow.
Voorhis|As you will. In any case, I thank you for a pleasant afternoon.
Geralt|No, thank you. Till next time.
Voorhis|And here we are. Thank you for your company.
Geralt|Likewise. See you.

Marabella|Now children, as you know, a ratcatcher was to visit us today to talk about his trade.
Novigrad Boy 01|Yeah!
Novigrad Girl 01|When's he gonna be here?
Marabella|It turns out he'll not come after all.
Novigrad Boy 01|Why not?
Marabella|A rat bit him, and he's caught a fever.
Novigrad Girl 01|Where'd he get bit?
Novigrad Boy 01|It hurt 'im much?
Novigrad Girl 01|Will he die?
Novigrad Boy 01|You don't die from rats, stupid.
Novigrad Girl 01|Yes you do. Just the other day I saw a witch hunter tell a man, "You rat"! And then he killed 'im!
Novigrad Boy 01|Liar!
Marabella|That's enough! We're done for the day. Gather your things and go home.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|See Dandelion after the… fungus incident?
Marabella|No. I even considered granting him another chance… His heart of hearts is pure gold, he simply needs a bit more discipline in his life.
Marabella|But he never came back to see me, so I thought if it's done, it's done.
Geralt|Found a poem Dandelion wrote about you. Portrayed you as an unusually talented individual.
Marabella|Really...? Did he mention my poetry?
Marabella|Horses have always fascinated me. I've always longed to extoll their noble beauty… Did you see any of my work at Dandelion's? Mere exercises, true, but I'd be curious to know what you thought of them.
Geralt|Uhh… No, no, didn't see any.
Marabella|"Gee-up! Her snakely whip rose skyward. Gee-haw! Crack! She reined the beast in!"
Marabella|"The stallion danced betwixt her thighs! Lather bathed its chinny-chin-chin."
Geralt|Sorry, don't know much about poetry…
Geralt|Thanks for your help. Farewell.
Geralt|Excuse me. I'm looking for Marabella.
Marabella|I am she. Wait outside, class is in session.
Geralt|Sorry, can't wait. Here about Dandelion. I'm Geralt, and I'm--
Marabella|Geralt? I know you.
Marabella|Fine, if you're eager to join in the lesson, you're welcome to.
Marabella|Children, sadly the ratcatcher has a fever today, but in his stead we're honored to welcome a witcher, who will now tell us about his trade.
Geralt|Uhh… But…
Novigrad Boy 01|Yeah!
Novigrad Boy 03|This is grand!
Marabella|You shan't disappoint them, will you?
Marabella|So, who would like to ask the first question?
Novigrad Boy 01|Me! What's it mean that witchers are lech'rous?
Geralt|You shouldn't listen to everything people say about--
Novigrad Girl 01|Means they go to sleep early.
Novigrad Boy 01|Oh, so that's why mum went to tuck that witcher in!
Marabella|Children! What's the meaning of this?! Next question.
Novigrad Girl 01|Is it true witchers kill kings?
Geralt|A man cursed, who's turned into a monster, a witcher might have to kill.
Geralt|Even if he's a king.
Novigrad Boy 01|So King Foltest was a monster?
Novigrad Girl 01|What's it like to cut off someone's head?
Novigrad Boy 02|Can you show us how to cut off a head?!
Novigrad Girl 01|Can we try your potions?
Marabella|Enough! That is all for today. Gather your things and I shall see you in the morning.
Novigrad Boy 01|Yeah!
Marabella|Bid farewell to Master Geralt.
Novigrad Boy 03|It's great you came.
Novigrad Girl 01|Hmph. I'da rather had the ratcatcher…
Marabella|So please do tell me - why are you here?
Geralt|I know you saw Dandelion recently.
Marabella|Oh yes. Longest afternoon of my life.
Geralt|He read you his poems?
Marabella|No. We perused the Illustrated Guide to Fungi.
Geralt|Hmm… Maybe… Nope. Won't even try to guess why he wanted to do that.
Marabella|Mold - that was his interest.
Marabella|When his hand abandoned my knee to point at a figure of penicillium, I knew the fire between us had died, permanently.
Geralt|Thanks. That was an ordeal. Think I'd rather face a swarm of nekkers than a class of 10-year-olds.
Marabella|The ratcatcher had no objections.
Geralt|Oh, yeah - how's he feeling?
Marabella|He's dead. Bubonic plague, it seems - I didn't want to upset the children… But you wished to speak of Dandelion.
Geralt|Don't believe everything they say about witchers…
Novigrad Boy 01|What 'bout animals? They don't like you. My mum says animals don't like bad folk.
Novigrad Girl 02|Tomcat ever hiss at you?
Novigrad Boy 02|You stoled many kids?
Geralt|No. It's not true.
Novigrad Boy 01|He's a liar.
Novigrad Girl 02|He ain't a liar, witchers don't lie.
Novigrad Boy 01|They can lie because they're not knights. When you gotta kill a dragon, you summon a knight. But if there's a zeugling in the trashheap, the knight won't wanna go, so you gotta call a witcher…
Geralt|It means that due to our mutations, we have an over developed libido.
Novigrad Boy 01|Libby dough?
Novigrad Girl 02|When a girl likes a witcher, the witcher says "What'll you give me for killin' a monster?" And she says: "Anything you want," so the witcher says: "Heheh - then you'll gimme somethin' you weren't expectin' at all."
Novigrad Girl 02|And that's where little witchers come from.
Geralt|Hmm… how old are you again?
Novigrad Girl 02|Nine!
Novigrad Boy 01|Uuhh…
Novigrad Boy 03|Eight!
Geralt|In that case, wait a few years and I'll tell you.
Geralt|I'll wait.
Marabella|It won't take long.
Geralt|Now can we talk?
Marabella|Yes. What do you want?
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Boy 01|Wonder if the ratcatcher'll get well.
Novigrad Girl 01|Like as not.
Novigrad Boy 01|How do you know?
Novigrad Girl 01|Mum says that if he but catches a cough, he's as good as in the grave. And this one's got a fever.
Novigrad Girl 01|When I grow up, I want to be a witcheress!
Novigrad Boy 01|You're stupid! Lasses can't be witchers or witcheresses.
Novigrad Girl 01|Who says so?
Novigrad Boy 01|Everybody knows it.
Novigrad Girl 01|Mum says "everybody" means as much as "nobody." I'm gonna be a witcheress and that's that.
<|endoftext|>
Elihal|Any better?
Geralt|So you're…
Elihal|Elihal.
Geralt|Did you and Dandelion… I mean - how'd you two meet?
Elihal|I met him one night in a tavern. He was blind drunk…
Geralt|What happened?
Elihal|What do you think? We spoke.
Geralt|That's it?
Elihal|I'm not sure what you're getting at, but I should make one thing clear - men don't interest me. Told him that as well.
Elihal|Luckily Dandelion's an open-minded fellow. We had a lovely evening. He became a loyal customer afterwards.
Geralt|Dandelion visit your shop often?
Elihal|I tried many times to talk him into a decent doublet. Sadly he'd only come in to get a button re-affixed or a hole patched…
Geralt|When'd you last see him?
Elihal|Some time ago… He brought in one of Zoltan's jerkins, insisted I sew on an extra pocket.
Elihal|Odd as requests go. I had the distinct feeling he'd actually come to talk.
Geralt|What did you and Dandelion talk about? He ask about anything in particular?
Elihal|Hmm… Let me think… Had an ordinary chat, really. Although… indeed, he did keep asking about Kalkstein.
Elihal|If Dandelion and I hadn't laid our cards on the table at the start, I might have suspected he had a history with the alchemist. He spoke like a lovesick beau.
Elihal|In fact, he desperately wished to meet with him.
Geralt|Kalkstein's in Novigrad? Wouldn't mind seeing him myself.
Elihal|You're too late, I fear. The witch hunters nabbed him recently, burned him at the stake in Hierarch Square…
Elihal|But as he perished - ooo, the goings on! Impressive. Fiery beasts circled his pyre, then rose into the sky and exploded to form letters.
Geralt|Really. What'd they spell?
Elihal|"Radovid sucks flaccid cock."
Geralt|I know this is none of my business, but why do you…
Elihal|Why do I dress up? As a child, I dreamt of becoming a doppler when I grew up.
Elihal|I became a tailor instead… Discovered clothing, costumes can express all the complexities of one's personality.
Elihal|I'm a Redanian countess one day, a dockside thug the next. That is true freedom!
Geralt|Mhm...
Elihal|Have you never thought to become someone else - even for a moment? Must be horribly boring being a witcher all the time.
Geralt|I manage to stay interested.
Geralt|Thanks for your help. And... nice to meet you.
Elihal|I can help with much more. If you need new trousers or a vest, you know where to find me.
Geralt|Don't think I wanna know what happened next…
Elihal|Oh, stop. He wasn't so drunk as not to figure it out.
Elihal|Besides, men don't interest me. I told him that from the start.
Geralt|I'm a friend of Dandelion's. Looking for Elihal.
Elihal|You've come to the right spot. How might I be of service? Need something shortened? Patch your trousers, darn your socks?
Geralt|You Elihal?
Elihal|Yes. Now pick your jaw up off the floor.
Geralt|Sorry, I thought… thought Elihal was one of Dandelion's girlfriends.
Elihal|Ahhh, so it's that. Wait here.
<|endoftext|>
Zoltan Chivay|Ah, you're back! You met Poppy? She ought to start talkin' any day now.
Geralt|That Field Marshal Duda's replacement? The marshal was a parrot - you do remember, right? Where'd you get her?
Zoltan Chivay|At auction. Some mage's estate went under the hammer. Witch hunters and the Eternal Fire joined forces, staked out his place and rounded the sorry sap up.
Zoltan Chivay|Put his things up for sale. Happened to be passin' by and saw this owl… Came with her own cage…
Geralt|How could you resist?
Zoltan Chivay|Couldn't. 'Tweren't possible. Ach, but Dandelion's what matters now.
Zoltan Chivay|So. How'd you do? Learn much?
Geralt|Women on my list hadn't seen Dandelion in a while. All claimed he'd been acting strange. Also mentioned he'd been seeing someone else.
Geralt|Thing is, mystery woman wasn't on my list.
Zoltan Chivay|What's she supposedly like, this lass?
Geralt|Blonde, from Kovir. A trobairitz, apparently. Named Callonetta or something like that.
Zoltan Chivay|Ach, that makes it clear as crystal!
Zoltan Chivay|It's Priscilla, aye - must be her.
Geralt|Who's this Priscilla?
Zoltan Chivay|A trobairitz, like you said. Quite popular of late. Picture Dandelion with a pair o' tits and you've got the general idea.
Geralt|Interesting image. So how'd Dandelion handle meeting his female double?
Zoltan Chivay|I think he fell in love.
Geralt|What can I say - could be he finally met his match.
Zoltan Chivay|She's his match, all right - maybe more.
Zoltan Chivay|The laddie's head's on fire. Lassy's got him whirlin'.
Geralt|All right. Guess we gotta talk to her.
Zoltan Chivay|Priscilla works with a mummers' troupe - "Renarde and the Foxen." Whenever they're in town, she performs nightly at the Kingfisher.
Geralt|Mean we've been sentenced to an evening of poetry?
Zoltan Chivay|Must ye always? This'll be true poetry, Geralt. You'll see.
Geralt|Hm. Dandelion in love? Actually, truly in love?
Zoltan Chivay|Ooh, yes.
Geralt|Why wasn't she on the list?
Zoltan Chivay|Hm, this Priscilla was'ne like the others… Think Dandelion more'n fancied her, think it was fervor…
Geralt|He lusts after every other woman he meets.
Zoltan Chivay|How can I explain…? Who does Dandelion love most?
Geralt|Himself.
Zoltan Chivay|Exactly. And she's his mirror image.
Geralt|Tell me what you've got first.
Zoltan Chivay|A few bruises and a torn doublet…
Zoltan Chivay|Otherwise, no' much of note. He wasn't stayin' with any of 'em, they'd not seen hide nor hair of 'im in ages… All I learned was a few of Dandelion's pick-up lines - of dubious worth.
Geralt|Hmm… Think I might have something better.
Zoltan Chivay|What're you waitin' for? Let's have at it!
Geralt|Let's hear 'em. I'm all ears.
Zoltan Chivay|Ahh, know how he wooed a lass studyin' natural history? Asked her about the habits of trolls. Hmph.
Zoltan Chivay|And know where he went with the cook from the Passiflora? The Oxenfurt - Novigrad road, which is just now bein' repaired.
Zoltan Chivay|Made her stare for hours as laborers crushed boulders into cobblestones, and tried to pass it off as a romantic outing!
Zoltan Chivay|Don't know about human women, but that would bore a dwarven lass to tears. He's growin' old, that poet of ours…
Geralt|Maybe… or maybe he did all that for a reason.
Zoltan Chivay|Sounds like you've found somethin' out…
Geralt|Zoltan, venture to say a mage would have trouble turning that owl into a parrot…
Zoltan Chivay|Sure you know me that well? Mark my words, she'll be playin' gwent with us in no time.
Zoltan Chivay|But we were to talk about Dandelion.
Geralt|Nice bird. But to the matter at hand.
Zoltan Chivay|How're you keepin', Poppy? Miss your Zoltan, you old bird?
Zoltan Chivay|What's this? Haven't even drunk our water? Naughty bird!
Zoltan Chivay|Now repeat: Savorrrry crrrrrackerrrrs.
<|endoftext|>
Inkeeper Elza|I know him!
Inkeeper Elza|Twas him murdered some Temerian boys back in White Orchard!
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Silence, woman. We've come to hear music.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|A murderer?
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|There's a war on. Some die.
Novigrad Nobleman 02|Oh, please argue this out elsewhere.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Squabbles and rows again! And I was told this was a decent establishment!
Zoltan Chivay|If I know Geralt, he risked his noggin to save someone else's arse!
Inkeeper Elza|Save, you say?! He murdered folk!
Geralt|Don't let 'em provoke you.
Novigrad Nobleman 02|There's the door! Settle this outside!
Priscilla|Come.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|I wish to listen to music! Music!
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Cultural capital of the world - the fuck it is.
Zoltan Chivay|Permit me… to introduce… err… This here's Priscilla, known also as Callonetta. As lovely as she is talented. And this…
Priscilla|… is Geralt of Rivia, I know. Dandelion's told me a great deal about you, and I've listened with bated breath.
Priscilla|Don't be surprised. After all, doubt I could think of a more fitting subject for a ballad than a witcher's love for a sorceress…
Priscilla|Or should I say - sorceresses?
Geralt|There's a good reason I don't pour my heart out to bards - they always babble, as you just demonstrated.
Geralt|But listen, besides giving you the details of my affairs, did Dandelion mention his own plans, where he might be going?
Priscilla|Hahahahah! Splendid! Very funny, truly! So, see you later!
Priscilla|Not here. Come with me.
Geralt|Seems Dandelion was meticulous in telling my story, down to personal and insignificant details. Did he offer anything about himself - like where he was going?
Zoltan Chivay|Saved you a seat. Set yourself down. Priscilla's on next.
Priscilla|{This line is for technical purpose only.}
Priscilla|These scars long have yearned for your tender caress. To bind our fortunes, damn what the stars own
Priscilla|Rend my heart open, then your love profess. A winding, weaving fate to which we both atone
Priscilla|You flee my dream come the morning. Your scent - berries tart, lilac sweet
Priscilla|To dream of raven locks entwisted, stormy. Of violet eyes, glistening as you weep
Priscilla|The wolf I will follow into the storm. To find your heart, its passion displaced
Priscilla|By ire ever growing, hardening into stone. Amidst the cold to hold you in a heated embrace
Priscilla|You flee my dream come the morning. Your scent - berries tart, lilac sweet
Priscilla|To dream of raven locks entwisted, stormy
Priscilla|Of violet eyes, glistening as you weep
Priscilla|I know not if fate would have us live as one. Or if by love's blind chance we've been bound
Priscilla|The wish I whispered, when it all began. Did it forge a love you might never have found?
Priscilla|You flee my dream come the morning. Your scent - berries tart, lilac sweet
Priscilla|To dream of raven locks entwisted, stormy
Priscilla|Of violet eyes, glistening as you weep
Priscilla|{This line is for technical purpose only.}
Priscilla|{This line is for technical purpose only.}
Zoltan Chivay|Ah, here already! Come on, let's find some arse-rests. Should start soon.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|There a reason for all this sneaking around?
Priscilla|An excellent one… When last I saw Dandelion, he told me he was planning a heist - Sigi Reuven's vault…
Zoltan Chivay|… Sheep dip…
Priscilla|… And I've not seen him since.
Geralt|Lemme guess - attempted heist was a failure?
Priscilla|Well he's not driven up in a gilded carriage laden with jewels, so I should think so.
Priscilla|I've asked after him everywhere, but it seems an army of tongue-stealing cats has overrun the city. I learned only that he raised a ruckus at Whoreson Junior's lair. Then Whoreson's men chased him all over town.
Geralt|Whoreson Junior… Doesn't ring a bell.
Zoltan Chivay|Biggest prick in Novigrad. Not literally, but…
Geralt|Got it. You're not a fan. But what'd he do to you?
Priscilla|Try the whole town. He's one of four bosses who control the city's underworld - the others being Sigi Reuven, Carlo "The Cleaver" Varese and the King of Beggars.
Zoltan Chivay|The rascal… At least he didnae cross the Church as well, bring that venerable institution into it. We'd be in deep, then.
Geralt|Here I go again, rushing to Dandelion's rescue… He oughta pay me a salary.
Priscilla|Wherever he is, I sincerely doubt he's in the mood for jokes. Nor am I, in fact.
Geralt|Relax, I'll get him out of this. Gotta talk to this Whoreson first - and Sigi Reuven. Know where I might find them?
Zoltan Chivay|I don't know about Whoreson but Reuven runs a bathhouse. Careful, though… he's a dangerous character.
Geralt|So am I.
Priscilla|I don't doubt it… but Dandelion's not. I beg you to hurry. Let me know as soon as you learn anything.
Geralt|Dammit… Hope Dandelion gets out of this alive…
Priscilla|And in one piece. Know what they do to bards? Break their fingers, or tear out their tongues… Or both.
Geralt|Reuven… What's he like?
Zoltan Chivay|Tall… Fat… Dangerous as hell.
Priscilla|Limp in his gait - left leg.
Geralt|Sounds like a lame rock troll.
Priscilla|If trolls were devilishly intelligent and had a flair for crime, yeah, I'd agree.
Geralt|Dandelion breaking into a vault… I'd sooner expect him to choose a life of celibacy.
Zoltan Chivay|True… Forgot to pay for his wine at the Passiflora once. He laid awake the next three nights worryin' about it.
Geralt|Any idea what got into him? He have debts he needed to pay off?
Priscilla|He claimed he was helping someone. An urgent matter that couldn't wait, he said.
Geralt|This "someone" - Dandelion mention their name?
Priscilla|No… But if I know Dandelion, it's "her" name he failed to mention. As he failed to mention "her" slender waist and ample bosom.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|You're his friend - any idea where he might be hiding?
Priscilla|With a doppler, the question is never "where," but "as whom."
Priscilla|In the past, facing trouble, he'd disappear, then reappear on the morrow as someone else.
Priscilla|But this time…? This time he hasn't returned.
Geralt|We need to convince Dudu to reveal himself. Any friends we could leave a message with, someone he trusts…?
Priscilla|Dandelion, Irina Renard's troupe - that's all, really. I'm not certain he was friendly with anyone else. Spent dawn to dusk with the troupe, on stage or in the crowd…
Geralt|So he liked going to the mummings…?
Priscilla|Yes. I'm actually surprised he didn't come to us after it all happened. He certainly could've counted on the foxen's help…
Geralt|Hmm… So if these mummers are ready to help…
Priscilla|We need only mention Dudu. Irina and company are deeply indebted to him.
Geralt|Maybe we could use a play. You know, work a message to Dudu into something. Lure him out of hiding that way.
Priscilla|Not a bad idea, but I doubt a few lines would suffice.
Priscilla|Besides, do you really think Dudu whiles away his days attending mummings he knows by heart?
Geralt|So what do you suggest?
Priscilla|We must write an entire new play, from scratch. Something grand, something that will grab Dudu's attention. So most importantly, it must have a splendid title.
Priscilla|It must be the talk of the town. If you wish, we can start on it right away.
Geralt|All right. Guess we can start writing the play.
Priscilla|Any ideas for the plot?
Geralt|Actually, I was hopin'--
Priscilla|The key is to convince Dudu that he can rely on you. And that we wish to free Dandelion.
Priscilla|The message must be clear, though naturally woven into the play's dramaturgical essence, meaning we need an appropriate dramatic structure. Following along?
Geralt|More or less.
Priscilla|That'll do.
Priscilla|Now to find the proper expressive form for our content. A gripping, contemporary story - that'd be best.
Priscilla|Perhaps about the condottieri of Poviss? I know: Lorenzo Molla. A tale of a handsome but ruthless bandit…
Priscilla|…and the doppler who manages to fool him. But now the doppler must hide and can only count on the help of his friend, who's a witcher…
Priscilla|…who in turn is prepared to do anything to save his daugh'… No, better - his beloved. Hmm… What do you think?
Geralt|Sounds great.
Priscilla|Really think so? Lorenzo Molla, yeah… Hm… Or perhaps not. Wait.
Priscilla|I've got it! We shall stage the story of the Urcheon of Erlenwald! Secret lovers, their betrothal, a curse, a cruel queen, bells sounding midnight…
Geralt|But--
Priscilla|At which point he reveals his face! He's a monster, there to steal Princess Pavetta! They want him dead, but at that instant a witcher steps in!
Priscilla|And everything ends splendidly. So, it's settled, yes? You wished to say something?
Geralt|We need a good title. Venture to say that's more important than the story itself.
Priscilla|I've some ideas - perhaps you can choose.
Geralt|Gonna consider my opinion this time?
Priscilla|Of course. We're partners in this. I'm just in charge.
Priscilla|I've two really good ones: "The Doppler's Salvation" and "A Changeling Rescued, or the Witcher's Triumph." Which do you prefer?
Geralt|Let's go with "The Doppler's Salvation." It's shorter, catchier.
Geralt|Just one problem - no dopplers in that story. Just a princess and a cursed urcheon.
Priscilla|Nothing simpler. We need merely swap the doppler in for the urcheon. The message - that's what's important: a witcher arrives and saves the doppler. Got it?
Geralt|Hm, all right. So it's a comedy?
Priscilla|I was thinking more along dramatic lines, but if you'd prefer something lighter… Listen, merely decide and I'll get to work.
Geralt|Hm, you're right. A drama'd be better.
Priscilla|Very well. I must get to work. While you… must pick a corner, sit down, read silently… or just think? All right?
Geralt|Fine. Since you don't need help with the writing…
Priscilla|Geralt, wait. A rhyme for "witcher"?
Geralt|Errr… "did itch her"?
Priscilla|Ugh. Just keep quiet.
Geralt|Think comedy's the safer option.
Geralt|"A Changeling Rescued, or the Witcher's Triumph" - really emphasizes the message we're trying to get across.
Geralt|Will I get a say in any of this? Or have you decided everything already?
Priscilla|Why are you cross? It's the nature of the creative process - we toss around ideas and choose the best ones.
Geralt|Meaning yours.
Priscilla|Well, you must admit I'm better acquainted with the theater.
Priscilla|Naturally, you'll play a part in shaping this play, contribute to the work as a whole. Dandelion will explain how it works later.
Geralt|Let's keep thinking. That seems a bit…
Priscilla|Too fresh? Right you are. Wait, give me a minute…
Geralt|Not entirely.
Priscilla|Tough, you'll need to pick it up as we go along. There's no time to explain everything to you.
Geralt|Yeah, all clear.
Geralt|Not sure I'm cut out to write a play. Maybe you're better off doing this on your own.
Priscilla|It's sure to go quicker if you help me. You'll see, we'll have a grand time together.
Geralt|We'll write the thing later.
Priscilla|Good. I'll have more time to prepare.
Priscilla|You may wish to speak to Madame Irina and her troupe first. You'll find them in the Butchers' Yard off the main market square.
Geralt|Be back soon. See you.
Geralt|Dudu and the mummers - how'd they meet?
Priscilla|That was my doing. Some opening night. Maxim lay comatose in his wardrobe, drunk as an otter. I thought of Dudu.
Priscilla|Hard to imagine a better actor than a doppler.
Geralt|And Dudu revealed himself to them, just like that?
Priscilla|I didn't think it wise to tell anyone, but Dudu and Irina took to each other completely and right away. He fell so hopelessly in love with the theater…
Geralt|That he started performing with you?
Priscilla|Yes. Now Irina feels terribly guilty. They let him put himself in danger. She can't forgive herself.
Geralt|Known Dudu long?
Priscilla|I know this might sound strange but…. I can't be sure.
Priscilla|It seems he'd been circling me for some time in various forms, trying to attract my attention…
Geralt|Can't blame him for making the effort.
Priscilla|Thank you. I failed to notice him at first. Then he decided to shoot the moon, assumed Dandelion's form.
Geralt|What tipped you off? How'd you know it wasn't Dandelion? Dudu not much of a singer?
Priscilla|No, he simply spoke about something other than himself.
Geralt|Think I know how to free Dandelion. Got a plan, but we need Dudu, gotta find him.
Priscilla|This… plan? What is it?
Geralt|Our doppler friend will assume Menge's form, order Dandelion moved to Oxenfurt. We can grab him on the way.
Priscilla|Brilliant, but how do you aim to find Dudu?
Geralt|Join us later. See ya.
Priscilla|Sure you know where to find her? The troupe performs in the Butchers' Yard, off the main square.
Priscilla|Hidden message?
Geralt|You were gonna work something in, like "Come to the Kingfisher at dawn" or…
Priscilla|That wouldn't be in keeping with the tone of the play! Not at all!
Geralt|You wrote it to contact Dudu! That was the purpose… Fine, so how do you see this working?
Priscilla|I don't know. I was counting on recognizing him by his scar… or just improvising. Shall we worry about that later? First, you must take the script to Madame Irina.
Priscilla|Ahh, done. I could make a small masterpiece of this had I a bit more time, but…
Geralt|We're fresh out of that. The hidden message to Dudu - what'd you weave in?
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Where's you goin'? That's a place o' culture, not a trough for swine to trudge to…
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Need a ticket?
Geralt|Yeah, one.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Here. Just stay outta sight, eh? Awful bashful, these mummers in rehearsal.
Geralt|No. No need.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|So be it. But you'll not get in. Whores through a window - them you can watch gratis. These here're artistes.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Door on the left.
Geralt|This where Madame Irina's troupe performs?
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Yeah. But you can only enter with a ticket. There's no performance now, mummers're just rehearsin'. Process is interestin' to observe, though.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|So. Want a ticket?
Geralt|No performance, said so yourself.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|You can still get a ticket. What'll it be?
<|endoftext|>
Irina Renarde|That was not bad, but we've work to do, still. I don't know… more fire!
Irina Renarde|But let's pause for now. Rest a bit.
Novigrad Peasant 01|Where do ye want to go? Golden Sturgeon or the Seven Cats?
Novigrad Rich Man 02|I'll not set foot in the Sturgeon. The scum they employ to serve patrons there--
Novigrad Peasant 01|Heheh. Admit it. You've eyes for that servin' wench at the Cats.
Irina Renarde|You're to return for rehearsal. Today, is that clear?
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Not to worry. We'll be there…
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Dancing and prancing as required.
Irina Renarde|No, no, wrong!
Irina Renarde|Almost. That was almost it, but-but--
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Well? What was wrong that time?
Irina Renarde|I don't know anymore… It simply needs more fire!
Novigrad Peasant 01|And now the kingdom's crown he wears… He will die this very night, to thee this I swear!
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|We must flee, my beloved! Guards approach, we are undone!
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Forget me not, remember! Avenge me, my son.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|And now I vanish. Poof - right?
Irina Renarde|Yes, splendid! That! That is what we need more of!
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Murderous venom he did seep in his ear! The traitor!
Novigrad Peasant 01|Defenseless, in slumber - yet his life he did abduct? Vile villain!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Good fight. Some nice footwork there.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Challenging me or is it Hal you wanna face?
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|A witcher versus the Beast of Metinna! Killer instinct versus primal rage!
Geralt|Like to hire you to help out. We're staging a play.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Need us to kick some arse on stage?
Geralt|Actually want you to usher, keep the peace, make sure no one's ass gets kicked - on stage or off.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Got the wrong men. Arse-kicking's what we do.
Geralt|I'll pay you well. Stand to make more than you do here.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Expecting trouble? Will we need to bust some heads?
Geralt|Can't rule it out. Bricks could start flying - heard that from a reliable source.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Hal! Wanna smash some bricklayers?
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Oh, he does, he does! Or I don't know me own brother.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Gimme that coin. And don't fret, we'll be there before any of the, uh, dancin' starts.
Geralt|How about a wager? If I beat Hal, you'll come work for me - gratis.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Hmmm, see, Hal's no fan of mummings. Failed romance, spare you the details.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|You'll need somethin' special to convince him. Here's an idea: take us both on, same time. Fight of the century - a witcher 'gainst the two-headed dragon of Metinna!
Geralt|What if I lose?
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Oh, you'll lose. But we'll still do your little job. You'll just pay us double.
Geralt|Not in the mood for a fight. Can't I just pay you?
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|How it always is with you ploughin' Nordlings.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Hal! Finish up, will you? We're gonna take in some high culture!
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|I'd never agree to this shite, normally. But must say I'm curious why a mutant's hirin' two boys from Metinna to keep the peace at a performance in Novigrad.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Give us the coin.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Hal! For fuck's sake, finish the bugger already! We're going!
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|We'll be there before any of the dancin' starts.
Geralt|Fine. Fight you both.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Cough up the coin first. Lose, and it stays with us.
Geralt|Double your wages. As promised.
Geralt|But if I win, I get it back.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Hal! Finish 'im! Got somethin' special lined up!
Geralt|Gotta think about it.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Go and think. Much as you want.
Geralt|You guys really from Nilfgaard?
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|We's from ploughin' Metinna, dammit. Not Nilfgaard.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Raised by wild hounds on the windswept plains of Mag Deira! Brothers forged in bloodshed, veterans of Metinna's infamous, filthy arenas!
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Who dares face the wild men of the South?! Who will look the beasts in the eye?
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Well, well... Ain't often you get such a lovely thrashin', eh, Hal?
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Man's speechless, but I can see it on his mug. Bugger likes you.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Time we got some rest - we'll guard whatever you want.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|For free, eh, Hal?
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Your coin - have it back. And don't fret, we'll get there before any of the, uh, dancin' starts.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Made up your mind? Willin' to take part in the fight of the century?
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Unless you've already found your, uh, ushers, for, uh… whatsit.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Fought well, white one.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Hal liked you. Can see it in his smile.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|We've time for a little rest, then we'll guard whatever it is you want. Don't fret, we'll get there before any of the, uh, dancin' starts.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|And we'll keep that coin, right Hal?
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Female Bard 01|{female bard sits by the window, plays the lute - sad, melancholic tune}
Geralt|Nice tune… Damn sad, though.
Novigrad Female Bard 01|Then it successfully conveys my mood… What do you seek here?
Geralt|Looking for the Puffins... Have I found them?
Elf Female 03|We've no coin. Leave us be!
Geralt|Think there's been a mistake…
Elf Female 03|Sorry... Thought our landlord had hired another thug to collect from us…
Geralt|Don't want any coin from you. In fact, I'm willing to pay you, provided you agree to get the word out about Madame Irina's new play.
Novigrad Bard 01|Oof, afraid that's impossible… Ever since we premiered our fateful ballad about "Holy Hemmelfart, who his faith ignores, gorges himself, diddles old whores," Fatso's gang has been harassing us incessantly…
Geralt|Fatso's gang?
Novigrad Bard 01|Common thugs in the Church's pay. City's full of gangs like that now.
Novigrad Female Bard 01|They threatened Nissa - said they'd round off her pointy ears with a carving knife.
Elf Female 03|They don't let us perform, chase away spectators, destroy our instruments. Lately, they've taken to lurking outside our home. We're at wit's end, no clue what to do…
Geralt|All right... Say I get Fatso and his boys to leave you alone. Will you publicize Irina's play then?
Elf Female 03|Of course, but… You shan't find it easy. There's no talking to that lot…
Geralt|I'm not a great talker anyway.
Geralt|They harm any of you?
Novigrad Bard 01|No, not yet. But it's merely a question of time.
Novigrad Female Bard 01|Nissa overheard talking about setting fire to something.
Geralt|Another thug? Flattered. Thanks.
Elf Female 03|Forgive us... You look threatening, and we've had our share of trouble lately.
Novigrad Bard 01|Nissa's on edge these days. We all are.
Geralt|Never mind... So long.
Novigrad Female Bard 01|{DNR Female bard sits by the window, plays the lute - sad, melancholic tune}.
Geralt|Mood hasn't improved much, has it?
Novigrad Female Bard 01|No reason it should have...
Novigrad Bard 01|Who… Who are you?
Geralt|Geralt. A witcher. Looking for the Puffins - that you?
Novigrad Female Bard 01|Yeah, that's us… but… you thrashed Fatso's boys. We saw everything from the window.
Geralt|They your friends?
Novigrad Bard 01|No! The opposite! They'd been hounding us, we dared not leave our home because of them.
Geralt|Got a job for you. Madame Irina's preparing a premiere. Need you to spread the word.
Novigrad Bard 01|Why, we'd be delighted!
Geralt|How much I need to pay you? We want the whole town talking about it.
Novigrad Female Bard 01|Argh, nonsense. We shall do it for free.
Novigrad Female Bard 01|You rid us of those bullies - consider it payment.
Geralt|All right… You'll want to see Madame Irina to get the details.
Novigrad Bard 01|We'll see her right away. You know it's heartening - a witcher not just partaking of cultured diversions, but aiding them.
Geralt|Shit happens. See you at the premiere.
Geralt|What'd they want from you?
Novigrad Bard 01|We premiered a ballad recently - "Holy Hemmelfart, who his faith ignores, gorges himself, diddles old whores…" they'd been hounding us since.
Elf Female 03|They broke our instruments, dispersed our crowds… Lately, they took to lurking outside our home.
Geralt|Didn't look terribly pious to me. Church of the Eternal Fire hire thugs like that now?
Novigrad Bard 01|Yes, the city's full of such gangs.
Geralt|Glad I could help. Farewell.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|All right, got the cast figured out.
Irina Renarde|It seems so. Prepared to plunge headlong into your career as a mummer?
Geralt|We can start now. Looked over the script, out of curiosity… We can start any time, even now.
Irina Renarde|Well, we've no time to lose. Come to the stage.
Geralt|Zoltan? What're you doing here?
Zoltan Chivay|Prissy told me you lot're puttin' on a play, with you playin' the lead…
Geralt|I'm not the lead…
Zoltan Chivay|So I thought to meself, I'd sooner shave me beard than miss that! Tell me, witcher - you gonna wear hose and a codpiece?
Irina Renarde|Come, Geralt. You must focus your mind before you go on stage.
Zoltan Chivay|Good luck!
Geralt|All right, let's start. Wanna get this over with.
Irina Renarde|Everyone says so before their first time. Afterwards, it's impossible to drag them off the stage. You'll see, you'll love it.
Geralt|Working on it. Still need to learn my lines. It's a lot to memorize…
Irina Renarde|One who knows an entire bestiary by heart and can blend dozens of alchemical brews can surely memorize a few lines of rhymed verse. Good luck!
Geralt|I need a bit more time…
Irina Renarde|Fine, but we should start soon.
Geralt|Who's playing the Witcher?
Irina Renarde|An amateur - it'll be my first time working with him. But I'm confident he’ll pull it off.
Geralt|Newcomer to the troupe?
Irina Renarde|In a sense... Oh, stop pretending you don't know. I'm talking about you.
Geralt|It's a good idea. Doubt I'll get a standing ovation, but Dudu'll see me. That's the key.
Irina Renarde|But… you will make an effort, won't you? Learn your lines, at least?
Geralt|I'll give it a shot, of course.
Geralt|I'm no actor. Might not have noticed, but I'm a little low on emotional expression.
Irina Renarde|But that's perfect. After all, you're to play the Witcher, not the Princess.
Irina Renarde|Besides, you must appear on stage, Dudu must see you. It's the crux of this entire endeavor.
Geralt|You're right. Just never thought I'd have to do something like this…
Irina Renarde|You'll be fine, dear. You need only strut on stage, great sword in hand, furl your brow, make some threatening faces, then deliver a few lines in a gravelly voice. Think you can manage?
Geralt|So, about the Princess - small part, but an important one. Any idea who could play her?
Irina Renarde|Priscilla would be the obvious choice - she's young and beautiful. Yet I do have more stage experience…
Geralt|Let's have Priscilla do it. No offense, but most people…
Irina Renarde|…assign greater importance to appearance than to talent. I understand. I shall let her know... I'm certain she'll be wonderful.
Geralt|Role's yours. Talent and experience trump looks in my book.
Irina Renarde|I'm honored. I shall give it my all.
Geralt|So who do you see playing the Doppler-Prince?
Irina Renarde|I'm finding it hard to decide between two candidates. Abelard Rizza would be the safer bet. He's been part of the our troupe for ages, has flawless technique… but he doesn't exactly captivate the crowds.
Geralt|Who's your other option?
Irina Renarde|Maxim Boliere. Outstanding actor and audiences love him, but sadly I can never be sure he'll show up sober. Or that he'll show up at all.
Geralt|Let's go with Abelard. I'll take a reliable artisan over an unpredictable artist any day.
Irina Renarde|Rightly so... The project is risky enough without our casting Maxim.
Geralt|Let's risk it and give the role to Maxim.
Irina Renarde|He's had a good spell of late, so maybe he won't let us down.
Geralt|These performances bring in much coin?
Irina Renarde|Well, it varies. On good days the square is barely capable of accommodating everyone, other times we're lucky to earn a handful of coppers.
Irina Renarde|Of course, we shall pay you a fee as well. You're a member of the ensemble now.
Geralt|Hm, thanks.
Geralt|See you later.
Irina Renarde|Remember to study your lines. We've no prompter, so you must know them backwards and forwards.
Geralt|Right.
Irina Renarde|Oh, show me! Let me… peruse it quickly, then we can discuss the other matters. What of the ushers you were to hire…?
Geralt|Taken care of. They'll be here for the performance.
Geralt|Wanted to talk about the text itself.
Irina Renarde|Hm, it's not at all badly written.
Irina Renarde|In fact, I quite like it! I was willing to relax my standards to help Dudu, but we may have something very interesting here.
Irina Renarde|I've very clear ideas who to cast as the Servant, the Witcher and the Queen. But I'm not certain who should play the Prince and the Princess…
Geralt|Think we need ushers? A play about dopplers could be controversial… but are ushers absolutely necessary?
Irina Renarde|Can't be sure if you've attended many performances, but Novigrad crowds can be particularly… difficult.
Geralt|Rotten apples, tomatoes, eggs - that sort of thing?
Irina Renarde|Axes, butchers' knives and bricks, actually.
Geralt|All right… Know anyone appropriate?
Irina Renarde|Try the docks, perhaps. You're bound to find some men willing to do any work for a few crowns.
Geralt|How can I help you spread the word about the premiere?
Irina Renarde|Well, we'd like all the city to hear about it, so we must clearly talk to the Puffins.
Geralt|Who're the Puffins?
Irina Renarde|Street artists. Get them to announce the premiere and even the mussels on the harbor piling will hear about it.
Geralt|Where'll I find them?
Irina Renarde|They did occupy some rooms in the Bits, in a townhouse, but I can't be sure they're still there. I've not seen them in the streets lately. They may very well have hung up their body hose…
Geralt|See if I can find them, and if they'll work for us.
Geralt|Priscilla's done. I have her manuscript of the play.
Geralt|So, we can start as soon as I hire some ushers?
Irina Renarde|Just so. Let me know as soon as you've found someone for the job.
Geralt|Thanks for your help. Be back with some ushers, and once Priscilla's done with the play.
Irina Renarde|See you then.
Geralt|Thanks for helping. I'll come back once I've found some ushers.
Irina Renarde|See you then.
Geralt|You any closer to being ready for this premiere?
Irina Renarde|Halberdier Number Two's in the props room crying. Apart from that, it's going splendidly.
Irina Renarde|And you? Are you ready?
Geralt|I wanna stage a play. Something that'll really draw the crowds.
Irina Renarde|I see… And you hope it will get Dudu's attention as well, draw him here. So it must be an entirely new play? And… who will write it?
Geralt|Priscilla.
Irina Renarde|Phew, I'm relieved. Time is short, but she's written many an excellent scene, practically in her lap, just hours before we've opened.
Irina Renarde|What will the play be about?
Geralt|Not sure yet, but we definitely have to mention dopplers.
Irina Renarde|Hm, that could be risky. But… We must think about getting the word out - about the new play - and arrange for some ushers to keep the peace. Will you tend to that?
Geralt|Priscilla, actually. She's done writing it. Tells the story of a witcher who rescues a doppler from certain death.
Irina Renarde|Hm, sounds interesting. I'll gladly have a glance, but first we must think about getting the word out and organizing some protection - ushers.
Irina Renarde|Would you mind tending to these matters?
Geralt|Dandelion's in trouble.
Irina Renarde|That much I guessed - though I am curious how serious it is.
Irina Renarde|Did he seduce a powerful man's wife and go into hiding? Or did he write an offensive couplet about the priests of the Eternal Fire?
Geralt|Worse. Lots. I'm gonna try to help him. Gotta contact Dudu first.
Irina Renarde|But he's disappeared as well.
Geralt|Have a plan to lure him out of hiding, but I need your help. Can I count on you?
Irina Renarde|Naturally, but what can we possibly do…?
Irina Renarde|How can I help? We've not seen Dandelion or Dudu recently…
Geralt|Madame Irina?
Irina Renarde|In the flesh. And you must be Geralt, the White Wolf! Dandelion's said so much about you!
Irina Renarde|Is he with you?
Geralt|No, but I hope to bring him back soon. Here to talk about Dudu.
Irina Renarde|Ah, there you are!
Geralt|Managed to hire some ushers.
Irina Renarde|Wonderful. That's one matter resolved.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|So you're the ones…
Novigrad Thug Weak 03|Oi, Fatso, look what we got here. Is it just me, or you got cat eyes?
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|Right he does! Stray cat must've fucked his mum! Heheheh!
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Now what you doin' in the city of the Eternal Fire, catshit?
Geralt|Leave the Puffins alone.
Novigrad Thug Weak 03|Worms that insulted Hierarch Hemmelfart? Called him a whoremonger? I'd sooner snuff out the Holy Flame itself!
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Tell them fuckin' poets to come down here. Shove their flutes up their blasphemin' arseholes!
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|Yeah, they'll play a different tune then - every time they fart! Hahah!
Geralt|Get out of here. Now.
Novigrad Thug Weak 03|Wha?!
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Fuck yeah!
Geralt|Give you coin to leave.
Novigrad Thug Weak 03|Fine. Give 'er here.
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Cept we're not goin' nowhere. Well, Yohan might run and get some wine, now we've got the means.
Geralt|I really dislike being cheated.
Novigrad Thug Weak 03|Come on then. Gonna rip me?
Geralt|You guessed it.
Geralt|Trash like you - not even worth bruising my fists.
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Look at that! Tough guy's turned coward! Harharharharhar!
Geralt|Leave the Puffins alone.
Novigrad Thug Weak 03|Aye... We will... Alone...
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|What the hell?
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Black magic! He's a fuckin' witch, get 'im!
Geralt|Never mind. I'm going.
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|Fuck off then! No one's keepin' you!
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|Why you always comin' back?
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Lookin' for a beatin? Well, you just found one.
Geralt|What the hell's this?
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|What's it to you, you prancin' freak?
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Look, he scared off our new friend. Can't have a civil conversation in public these days without some dreg buttin' in.
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|This is the city of the Eternal Fire. No room for his kind here.

Novigrad Rich Woman 03|Witcher! Your task is a matter most tender.
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|A monster shall show at tonight's feastly splendor.
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|Stand guard, beware, kill the beast if he shows...
Geralt|To slay beasts most foul - 'twas for this I was made,
Geralt|I kill as my calling, not just to get paid.
Novigrad Poor Man 01|He's swallowed the bait, this fool of a witcher!
Novigrad Poor Man 01|I'll ensure the foul beau reveals his true figure.
Novigrad Poor Man 01|The monster revealed, the witcher shall strike,
Novigrad Poor Man 01|the beast will he slay, thrust his head on a pike!
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|Ah... My child will pity her love, this beast.
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|But a fiend and a maid? No, this must cease.
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|Though at least, ere he goes, he'll enjoy a last feast!
Geralt|I kill monsters for pleasure... And…
Geralt|And... No man is my measure…
Novigrad Rich Man 01|My dear! Long have we hid our love's tender fires.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|That having said - I'll get down on my knee.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Our hearts' torment over, we shall love for centuries!
Irina Renarde|Oh, darling, I will, I will, I will!
Priscilla|Oh, darling, I will, I will, I will!
Novigrad Poor Man 01|Wait! With wine must we toast this moment joyful.
Novigrad Poor Man 01|If not, a foul curse shall rend your lives woeful.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|My bowels contract, a foul beast to deliver!
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Soon all shall see my true monstrous figure!
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|Behold, witcher, the beast of which I spoke!
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|Unleash your sword! Let fly the killing stroke!
Irina Renarde|Stop! Stop! Beast or man, 'tis my love, my betrothed!
Priscilla|Stop! Stop! Beast or man, 'tis my love, my betrothed!
Geralt|Sheathe your blades! Fear a doppler? 'Tis a thing most foolish.
Geralt|Changing one's shape does not make one ghoulish.
Geralt|Remember! 'Tis not flesh a monster makes…
Geralt|Hey! Hear the princess' command? Come up here!
Novigrad Peasant 01|Come on then, guv'nor! Up you go! On stage!
Novigrad Peasant 02|Toss the traitor scum in the dungeon!
Geralt|Don't be afraid. In the end, everyone'll live happily ever after.
Geralt|Doppler and princess wed the same night.
Geralt|The servant's heart melted, he wept at the sight.
Geralt|But a lack of morals... And a surfeit of cakes…
Geralt|But a heart that is base, such as in this knave aches!
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|Witcher, 'tis true! This wretch's foul suspicions…
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|…tainted my mind with this plan so malicious.
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|The doppler must live, my daughter he'll wed.
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|Beast or man, she loves him truly, without dread.
Geralt|Tis our tale's end, good folk, and it's moral is this…
Geralt|No monster is he whose shape can shift.
Geralt|Show love for dopplers... As well as for fish.
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|The witcher is just - a true doppler's friend.
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|But you, foul page, in chains you shall end.
Irina Renarde|Guard! Call the guard! Remove the traitor at once!
Priscilla|Guard! Call the guard! Remove the traitor at once!
Geralt|Hey! Hear the princess' command? Come up here!
Novigrad Peasant 01|Come on then, guv'nor! Up you go! On stage!
Novigrad Peasant 02|Toss the traitor scum in the dungeon!
Geralt|Don't be afraid. Everyone lives happily ever after in the end.
Geralt|Doppler and princess wed the same night.
Geralt|The servant's heart melted, he wept at the sight.
Novigrad Poor Man 01|Majesty! The monster slayer awaits! Your summons he's answered and stands at the gates!
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|Show him in, I must speak to the man.
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|Lest that dread beast take my daughter's hand.
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|And a grateful queen shall reward your woes.
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|But first - some wine - to steady my hand.
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|Your reward you'll receive on my finest pillows.
Novigrad Poor Man 01|Gathered are we, a host fair and noble,
Novigrad Poor Man 01|to celebrate this day the princess's betrothal!
Geralt|Alas, no monster do I see or hear...
Geralt|Perhaps 'midst the guests he hides, in fear?
Geralt|Maybe he hid... In the cellar... Or a barrel of beer.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Months we've restrained our loins' hot desires!
Novigrad Rich Man 01|In stealth we'd meet, in deceit, like liars.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Tonight shall it end - be my wife, that's my plea!
Geralt|Hark! Hark! 'Tis no prince, but a doppler impostor!
Geralt|If the maid loves him... It seems we've lost her…
Geralt|Seems men's hearts can love for changelings foster!
Novigrad Thug Weak 03|He's right! Oy, mummers! Don't know the Eternal Fire's commandments?
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Blasphemers! Oughta teach them respect for the faith!
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|What you on about! Shut the fuck up and clap, afore I tear you new arseholes.
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Take more than threats to keep us quiet!
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|S'all right. I'll try me knuckledusters. Come here!
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Tear me a new one?! We'll see about that! On your feet, boys! Give 'em a taste o' hell - in the name o' the Church!
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|Give us a hand, witcher! Can't take 'em on our own!
Novigrad Thug Weak 03|Give it a rest, mate. Can't you see it's all in fun?
Novigrad Thug Weak 03|It's a comedy - a ghoul could play the prince. Lighten up, for gods' sake.
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Dopplers to the stake! Burn 'em all!
Novigrad Rich Man 02|My dear! Long have we -hic- hid our love's tender fires.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|In stealth we'd kiss… uh… deceitful, like liars.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Months I held back my loins' hot desires!
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Tonight shall it end - Be my wife, that's my plea!
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Our hearts' torment over, we shall love for centuries!
Novigrad Rich Man 02|And then I shall pluck your ripe virginity!
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Treason! 'Tis not wine, but a brew spiked with silver!
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Argh! 'Tis not wine… but a brew spiked with silver!
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Soon all shall see my true monstrous figure!
Novigrad Rich Man 02|My bowels contract, a foul beast to deliver!

Irina Renarde|Dudu! We were so worried!
Dudu Biberveldt|I'm fine, I'm all right.
Dudu Biberveldt|Though if not for Geralt, it might've ended very badly.
Dudu Biberveldt|Where's Dandelion? Why's he not with you?
Irina Renarde|He's disappeared, vanished around when you did. I'm afraid only Geralt knows what it's all about.
Dudu Biberveldt|We must find him. I'm certain we can together.
Irina Renarde|Will you put yourself at peril again?
Irina Renarde|No, you must not, it's too dangerous. You must remain out of sight, let others handle it.
Dudu Biberveldt|Though it started to get ugly there.
Dudu Biberveldt|Crowds do like to jeer, but few are willing to fight a witcher.
<|endoftext|>
Dudu Biberveldt|Geralt! You recognized me! How'd you do it?
Geralt|Greetings, Dudu. Heard about that souvenir Whoreson left on your face.
Dudu Biberveldt|So… you know… everything? Have you seen Ciri?
Geralt|No. Still looking for her.
Zoltan Chivay|Geralt! Masterful! You did great! Haven't laughed that hard in ages! Lads won't believe it when I tell 'em!
Geralt|Explain one thing to me: how'd you and Dandelion manage to displease Reuven, Whoreson, and the Temple Guard all at the same time?
Dudu Biberveldt|It's not as if we planned it…
Zoltan Chivay|Heheheh.
Geralt|I know Ciri went back to Whoreson's to get you. How'd you manage to escape?
Dudu Biberveldt|I ran after her, wanting to keep up, but… I'd 'ave been a hindrance. She called out to me, entreated me to shape shift and disappear…
Dudu Biberveldt|I tried to find them - Ciri and Dandelion. It was as if they'd turned to vapor. Fearing for my life, I shifted each day, becoming someone else.
Dudu Biberveldt|Even considered turning into Ciri, to trick her pursuers, but--
Zoltan Chivay|Slow down, marmalade. Hmmm.
Zoltan Chivay|Geralt, when'd you last see Cirilla, hm? Been a while, hasn't it?
Geralt|A while, yeah.
Zoltan Chivay|For me, likewise. Must be a full grown lass by now. Dudu, do us a wee favor - show us Ciri, for a moment.
Dudu Biberveldt|Geralt?
Geralt|No, no need. I'll recognize Ciri when I see her. Sure of it.
Zoltan Chivay|I, uh… just thought you might want to see…
Zoltan Chivay|Not angry with me, are ye, Geralt?
Geralt|No.
Zoltan Chivay|I feel relieved.
Dudu Biberveldt|And Dandelion? Were you able to find him?
Geralt|Witch hunters nabbed him. But there's good news, too.
Geralt|We think we can free Dandelion. Just need your help.
Dudu Biberveldt|What could I do?
Geralt|Take on Menge's appearance. Then go and give the order for Dandelion to be moved to Oxenfurt.
Zoltan Chivay|We'll lay in ambush in the ravine en route. Spring Dandelion from the convoy when it rolls by.
Dudu Biberveldt|Wait… Not so fast. How am I to be Menge? And I've no notion where Dandelion's being held…
Geralt|Listen, you'll manage. Everybody believes Menge's missing. You can make up any story you want.
Zoltan Chivay|Me lads and me'll lie in ambush in the ravine. Geralt'll then join us and we'll await word from ye.
Dudu Biberveldt|But how am I to contact you as Menge? Send word that the convoy's left?
Geralt|You'll need to figure that out. Come on, guile's your middle name.
Zoltan Chivay|So? We all clear? Dudu, get your arse to Temple Isle. I'm off to assemble my crew, and we'll be waitin' for ye, Geralt.
Geralt|Yeah. See you in the ravine.
Dudu Biberveldt|Whoa! Wait! Hold on! What happens after? I-I hope you don't expect me to continue as Menge, live like Chappelle, burning the occasional heretic to keep up appearances…?
Geralt|No, once it's over, we expect to see you at the Rosemary and Thyme, where we'll all meet…
Zoltan Chivay|…to get pissed like wild badgers. So? Settled? Let's get to work!
Geralt|We could use a bit of support. Lemme talk to Dijkstra.
Geralt|Catch him in a good mood, and he just might lend us a few bodies.
Zoltan Chivay|We'd manage, we would, with just my lads, but if you miss Sigi that much…
Geralt|He's the one's got a soft spot for me. Said so himself recently.
Geralt|Dandelion's on Temple Isle. Imprisoned there. You'll need to find out exactly where.
Dudu Biberveldt|But what if they grow suspicious? Start asking questions?
Zoltan Chivay|I'll bet my best axe no one'll pester the commander of the Temple Guard.
Zoltan Chivay|Besides, you're a doppler and an actor - and an actor and a doppler. Got double the spark to improvise your way outta any situation.
Zoltan Chivay|Things get spicy you'll just nip round the corner and transform into a buxom wench, a jackdaw or whatever else strikes your fancy.
Dudu Biberveldt|Of course. It's that simple. Thanks.
Geralt|No one knows Menge's dead. Don't need to worry about being exposed.
Dudu Biberveldt|No one… save you? Would this have anything to do with the fire at the witch hunters' barracks?
Geralt|We were in the area.
Zoltan Chivay|Heheh… I sorely regret not seein' that!
Geralt|Menge's dead.
Dudu Biberveldt|Ugh, a fiend. Good thing someone finally killed it.
Dudu Biberveldt|Though another just as bad or worse will likely take its place.
Zoltan Chivay|Wouldn't be so quick to assume. Got a feelin' it could be a decent fellow.
Dudu Biberveldt|What's he talkin' about?
Geralt|Transform… change into her.
Cirilla|I feel strange, both of you staring at me bug-eyed. Is that enough?
Geralt|Yeah, plenty. Bad idea.
Geralt|Why didn't you find Priscilla or the mummers, contact them?
Dudu Biberveldt|I came to a few performances, different shape each time, but I dared not show myself… Feared I'd put them at risk.
Dudu Biberveldt|Then I got word of the new mumming, saw it as my chance to learn something, anythin' about Ciri and Dandelion.
Irina Renarde|Here you are - your fee. I must admit your style of mumming, well, it's quite… minimalist. Did you study anywhere?
Geralt|At Kaer Morhen. Minimum expression means maximum effect. Thanks for the coin. Take care, now.
Irina Renarde|Such a shame Maxim went on stage inebriated after all… Some of the crowd demanded refunds.
Irina Renarde|You were right to cast Abelard as the Prince. It's likely Maxim would have shown up drunk as a fish, or forgotten about the premiere altogether.
Geralt|The performance in general - what'd you think?
Irina Renarde|I doubt the audience understood it all, but that's to be expected.
Irina Renarde|I'm just pleased the Puffins got the word out. That was quite the crowd.
Irina Renarde|Not bad, not bad at all… for your first time out. Just a few minor trip-ups.
Irina Renarde|You were marvelous! Not a single mistake!
Irina Renarde|Oh, Geralt, Geralt… I fear I'd be more successful hunting a beast than you were on stage.
Geralt|Could be. You'd still be wiser not to try.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Seems everything's ready.
Zoltan Chivay|Aye. Soon as we catch sight of 'em, we'll block the road, 'gainst a whole unit, if need be. And… you know I think it's a great plan all around, and I'm always glad to help…
Zoltan Chivay|And it's not like I'm not eager to crack some holier-than-thou buggers' skulls, but…
Zoltan Chivay|Seein' as we've got a doppler, wouldn't it've been easier to have him release Dandelion and-and be done with it?
Geralt|Too suspicious. Think about it - Menge disappears, then shows up with a scar on his face to release Dandelion?
Zoltan Chivay|Ehh, I suppose you're right.
Geralt|Priscilla? What're you doing here?
Priscilla|Some child brought a note from Dudu - the convoy will leave at dawn. May I stay with you? I can't stand it, sitting at home, worrying about Dandelion.
Zoltan Chivay|Never fear, my dear, you'll get your warbler back, just hope he's got his p--
Zoltan Chivay|Dammit! Gotta watch the rhymes in the presence of a lady.
Geralt|Go back to town.
Priscilla|Please… I shan't be any trouble.
Zoltan Chivay|Aw, c'mon, Geralt, leave it go, let her stay. Look at her, all weepy-eyed… Like my Muttsie when his guts knotted up.
Geralt|This is no place for her. Something happens, I don't wanna have to explain to Dandelion why she was here to begin with.
Priscilla|Need I remind you that you're here to rescue Dandelion, not me? Seems I can take care of myself.
Geralt|Fine. But remember…
Priscilla|I know. As soon as the fighting starts, I'm to stand at a distance.
Zoltan Chivay|Not much happening just yet. And it might be some time 'fore it does…
Priscilla|Well, how about a game of gwent?
Geralt|Sure, let's play.
Geralt|Don't really feel like it. You two play.
Geralt|Fine, she can stay. On one condition…
Geralt|This ambush is simpler - 'cause Menge was already planning to move Dandelion to Oxenfurt.
Geralt|Dudu just confirms an order everyone knew Menge was planning to give. If he released Dandelion, he'd need to explain why, probably raise suspicions in the process.
Priscilla|Have I won again? My goodness.
Priscilla|So, another hand? If you've no more coin, we could play for…
Dwarf Man 01|They're comin'! They're comin' now!
Geralt|Priscilla, stay here.
Dwarf Man 01|Heeey-rup!
Dandelion|Heeeeeelp!
Geralt|Dandelion! Dammit…
Zoltan Chivay|Geralt! Go after him! Leave these here to us!
Zoltan Chivay|Hm, all right, you know the basics, that's clear. Now we can play for real.
Priscilla|Hahahah!
Priscilla|This was a stupid idea.
Geralt|You're the one wanted to play.
Zoltan Chivay|Geralt! All these buggers are done! Now stop fartin' about and go after Dandelion!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Recently mentioned you, uh, have something of a soft spot for me. Gotta ask you a favor…
Dijkstra|Oh-hoo! That's quite the start, Geralt. What's it you want?
Geralt|Need to carry out an ambush. Could use a few of your men.
Dijkstra|An ambush? What's this about?
Geralt|Gimme men who'll survive the fight - they can tell you afterwards.
Dijkstra|Heheh… I really do like you, Geralt. That's why I'll give you not one, not two, but three of my best men.
Geralt|Three's enough.
Dijkstra|Then it's settled.
Geralt|I was hoping for a number ending in "teen."
Dijkstra|Teen? How many "best men" you think I have?
Geralt|Hm - more than three, maybe?
Dijkstra|I'll give you your "teen" once you tell me what you're planning.
Geralt|No can do.
Dijkstra|So, where should this elite trio of my best meet you?
Geralt|Dijkstra...
Dijkstra|Shush! Remember: I'm Sigi.
Geralt|Here of all places, I'd think we can talk freely. Or are you afraid your own men spy on you?
Dijkstra|Of course they spy on me. I'd be disappointed if they didn't - after all, I do choose the very best.
Geralt|So how many of your best can you give me, Sigi?
Dijkstra|Ah, all right, you've convinced me. Four.
Geralt|Fine.
Geralt|Need to attack a Temple Guard convoy.
Dijkstra|Hm, wouldn't have any other favors to ask, would you? Search your heart, let me know, hm?
Geralt|You can only give me three men, really?
Dijkstra|Since you aim to stick your prick in the Eternal Fire itself, I can't even give you that number.
Geralt|Mean you refuse to help?
Dijkstra|I mean that at the appointed time and place, you will find six men waiting, who have absolutely nothing to do with me. Is that clear?
Geralt|As a bright summer day. Thanks.
<|endoftext|>
Dwarf Man 01|Hey, you! What the hell's afoot here?
Geralt|What is it?
Dwarf Man 01|You tell me! One o' them hunters barged into our hut, turned us out 'fore we could so much as fart in protest.
Geralt|There another man with him - tall, dark-haired?
Gnome Man 02|Aye. Jabberin' the whole time.
Geralt|Mhm, Dandelion. So, hunter's barricaded himself inside? There another way in?
Dwarf Man 01|Truth be told, there is…
Geralt|Wanna get rid of this hunter or not?
Dwarf Man 01|Honest? We'd see you all gone, but he'll do for a start. Here. The key. Cellar door 'round the back.
Geralt|Thanks.
Geralt|Where's this other way in?
Dwarf Man 01|Aren't you curious? It's an ordinary tunnel, back way out in case o' trouble…
Gnome Man 03|We don't let strangers in there, show it to 'em, even! And there's--!
Dwarf Man 01|Hrmph. Shut it!
<|endoftext|>
Witch Hunter 04|And how can I be sure you won't try anything?
Dandelion|I'll go with you. Not like I really have a choice now, do I?
Witch Hunter 04|And there'll be no trickery along the way? I could wring your neck like a fat hen's, you realize…
Dandelion|Yes, but I also realize you won't. My corpse is worth nothing to you, whereas alive…! Like I said - a hundred gold ingots.
Dandelion|One hundred gold ingots - no more, no less, or I'm not Julian Alfred Pankratz, Viscount de Lettenhove!
Witch Hunter 04|Viscount? Come on, everybody calls you Dandelion…
Dandelion|That, my friend, is what we call an assumed identity. Can't expect me to reveal my full title to every goitered idiot I run across.
Dandelion|Now, if you could just unbind…
Witch Hunter 04|Sit there. There, I said! And shut it!
Dandelion|All right, all right. But what then? How long do you think you can keep me in this hut?
Witch Hunter 04|Quiet!
Dandelion|Don't worry about me, I'll be quiet. But those halflings? You can't trust them, you know…
Dandelion|Once I saw one of them… Ouch!
<|endoftext|>
Dandelion|Priscilla? What're you doing here?
Priscilla|Are you all right? You had me worried sick!
Zoltan Chivay|Dandelion, you rascal! Got this lass to thank for us racin' after youse. She chivvied and chivvied…!
Dandelion|Shame you arrived too late to see us hoodwink that hunter! I had a plan all set, but then Geralt…
Geralt|Dandelion, I need to ask you something. It's important, so focus. Where's Ciri?
Dandelion|Ciri? I thought, seeing how you're here… You haven't seen her? I… well I don't know where she is.
Geralt|When'd you last see her?
Dandelion|We were on Temple Isle, running from Whoreson's men…
Geralt|I know you tried to help her. Gotta say I'm having trouble understanding why you went to Whoreson Junior of all people…
Dandelion|No one else came to mind. Maybe, given more time, I'd have done things differently, but Ciri said the Wild Hunt was on her tail.
Dandelion|Whoreson seemed pretty harmless by comparison.
Geralt|Something went wrong…
Dandelion|So you've heard everything? I hope you're not mad, you can't be…
Dandelion|My plan was perfect… until we put it in motion. How was I supposed to know Menge was after Dudu?
Geralt|Heard enough about your plan. Need to know what happened to Ciri now.
Dandelion|You've made a wise choice. Very wise. Might not be more than a sergeant today, but tomorrow…
Witch Hunter 04|Quiet! I thought I heard something.
Dandelion|What? No, no, no! You see, me and gags, we don't--
Dandelion|Mff mmmmf!
Dandelion|Ahh, hahaha - it is good to see you, friend! Been a while since you were last in Novigrad. What's--
Geralt|Come on. We'll talk outside.
Dandelion|Geralt! Must you ruin everything? I had him just where I wanted him…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|She's slipped away, again… I was so close.
Dandelion|Hmm… She came here from Velen. Somebody there helped her, apparently. Maybe she went back?
Geralt|Maybe… I'll need to check. Also gotta see if Yen's learned anything in Skellige.
Priscilla|You two have chattered enough. Now it's my turn to talk to Dandelion.
Zoltan Chivay|And I'll gladly have a go at him when you're done. Let's get back to the Rosemary and Thyme.
Dandelion|Weeell, I've certainly had my share of excitement for one day. A juicy roast and a soft bed with fluffy pillows - I think that's the least I'm owed…
Dandelion|We haven't seen each other, talked, in ages. Consider dropping by if you're in the area.
Geralt|I'm sure to be by sometime soon.
Dandelion|I'll hold you to that, Geralt. See you soon. And thanks again for today.
Geralt|Doubt it. Talked to the baron there - he's the one helped Ciri. Said she rode off to Novigrad to look for Yen and me.
Geralt|And Yen's in Skellige, looking into traces she thinks Ciri left behind there.
Dandelion|So? Skellige?
Geralt|Skellige.
Geralt|Guess I should head back to Velen...
Geralt|Maybe… Besides, the curse might've had something to do with Uma. I should collect him from the baron.
Dandelion|Uma - the, uh, deformed midget? What will you do with him?
Geralt|First, lift the curse. Maybe I can get some help at Kaer Morhen.
Geralt|After that - who knows.
Geralt|It would also explain her spectacular appearance there a second time around… But she's not in the isles anymore, I'm sure of that.
Geralt|Doesn't mean a thing to me.
Dandelion|Even less to me.
Geralt|Ciri ever mention him?
Dandelion|Some deformed midget? No.
Dandelion|Didn't say much at all, to be honest.
Dandelion|Geralt, she's no longer that little girl who ran around Kaer Morhen.
Dandelion|Sure, she's still impulsive, alive, but she's also stubborn and sulky... Apple didn't fall far from the tree, lemme tell you.
Geralt|Right…
Geralt|Dammit, that's just not enough. Ciri say anything else?
Geralt|No, a certain deformed midget who appeared out of the blue on the shores of Hindarsfjall…
Geralt|And now wanders around the baron's castle…
Dandelion|Argh, you and Ciri - like two water droplets. Never know what either of you are talking about.
Geralt|Hm, the curse invokes ugliness… My entire life, don't think I've seen anyone uglier than--
Dandelion|Stunning Gemma?
Dandelion|Ah, what an adventure! One minute we were pulling off the heist of the century, the next we were prey, a pack of hunters on our tail…
Priscilla|Yes, a splendid story, but I think I've had my fill of this boasting. Come, Zoltan, we must convince the halflings they saw nothing at all.
Dandelion|Gave me enough material for a volume of ballads! And this one'll sell like hotcakes!
Geralt|Nobody's gonna read that drivel.
Dandelion|Sheesh, what crawled into your britches and bit you?
Geralt|I'm just… worried.
Dandelion|About who? Ciri? Have a little faith, Geralt.
Dandelion|You have any idea how she fights?! The girl can take care of herself, believe me.
Dandelion|Anyway, she's gotta come back for that little box. The trinket that started it all.
Geralt|Mean this?
Dandelion|You get it from Whoreson?! Whoa, Ciri'll be overjoyed. Whoreson on the other hand's gotta be pre-tty furious!
Geralt|Ciri ever tell you what this is? And Whoreson - why'd she go to him with it?
Dandelion|She went to Whoreson because I took her there.
Geralt|Coulda guessed that was your idea.
Dandelion|What? Her magic bauble was broken - Whoreson had access to the mages who could fix it.
Dandelion|Besides, she needed help deciphering a curse… its incantation.
Geralt|Know any more about the curse? Something specific, a detail? Anything?
Dandelion|Hmm... Well, I know the words.
Geralt|You're kidding.
Dandelion|No. They were elven. Ciri was constantly repeating them to herself, probably not to forget.
Dandelion|Went like this: "Va fail, elaine, ceàdmil folie! Glaeddyv dorne aep t'enaid, bunn'droh ithne i'yachus."
Geralt|What was Ciri's interest in this curse? Did she want to cast it or lift it? She tell you?
Dandelion|She wasn't all that willing to talk about it. I didn't want to pry.
Geralt|The one time when it might've been useful.
Dandelion|But I'm almost positive she meant to lift it.
Geralt|Off who, what? Or was it about her directly?
Dandelion|No... I don't think so… I mean, she didn't look cursed.
Dandelion|But boy was she in a hurry.
Geralt|Whoreson's dead.
Dandelion|Oo, guess you're no stranger to fury, either.
Dandelion|Weeeell, can't say I regret the man's abrupt passing. Deserved it as much as he deserved that… awkward nickname.
Dandelion|What about our old friend Sigi Reuven? Been to see him yet?
Geralt|He's fine.
Dandelion|That's too bad. 'Cause there's a good chance he's furious with me…
Geralt|Well, he wasn't exactly thrilled.
Dandelion|Hey, while you were at it, you didn't think to put in a good word for me, did you?
Dandelion|Something like, I never intended to cheat him and if he harms a hair on my head he'll have you to deal with?
Geralt|Ran outta time.
Dandelion|You don't care a lick about your friends.
Dandelion|What about Sigi Reuven… how's he doing?
Geralt|Fine, last I heard.
Dandelion|That's too bad. 'Cause I have a sneaking suspicion he might be a teeny bit mad at me…
Geralt|You've made your bed - lie in it.
Geralt|No, but I'll make sure to mention it next time.
Dandelion|Thanks! Adventures are great, but they can hard to write up if you're fingerless. Which is not to say Whoreson would stop at that.
Geralt|That all you care about - the ballads this'll inspire?
Geralt|Ego swell a bit lately? Getting more and more selfish with age.
Dandelion|What is that about?
Geralt|It's about Ciri!
Dandelion|Why would I ever worry about her?
Geralt|Right… Best bit's when the guard draped you over his saddle like a sack of corn.
Geralt|Stands to make you a fortune.
Dandelion|Time will tell.
Dandelion|You're getting to be grumpy in your old age.
<|endoftext|>
Dandelion|She's late, of course. She knew how important this night was to me!
Geralt|Course she did. Probably just making herself gorgeous. Takes time, you know.
Dandelion|So it's true - a woman's vanity knows no bounds.
Novigrad Dockworker 03|Agh - Master Dandelion! Priscilla - she's--!
Dandelion|What?! Speak, man!
Novigrad Dockworker 03|She's badly hurt. Been attacked. They took her to Vilmerius Hospital.
Dandelion|Attacked? She's h-hurt?! Geralt, come with me. Please.
Geralt|Of course. Let's go.
Geralt|Meet you there… soon.
Dandelion|Good. I'll… I'm off.
<|endoftext|>
Von Gratz|I'd say that's certain. Her condition's critical but stable. Beg your pardon, but you are a relative?
Dandelion|Relative? No. A friend… A very close friend.
Von Gratz|Dandelion, correct? She uttered the name in her few moments of lucidity. I am Joachim von Gratz. Head of surgery. Until recently, a lecturer at Oxenfurt Academy.
Geralt|Enough of the courtesies. What're her injuries? Besides her eye.
Von Gratz|A concussion, cranial swelling, incision into her larynx and scalding inside the throat and esophagus. Clearly, someone forced her to imbibe a caustic fluid.
Geralt|So, this was no ordinary attack, no robbery.
Von Gratz|Clearly not… It was the act of a demented mind. And not its first.
Geralt|How can you know that?
Von Gratz|I've seen wounds like this - they're not the kind one would forget, don't you agree? In fact, just this week a corpse turned up in the morgue with similar injuries - and no heart.
Dandelion|No hea--? You mean, that might've happened to Priscilla? Is someone looking into this?
Von Gratz|This is Novigrad. Only the innocent burn here.
Dandelion|Geralt… I know I owe you, a hundred times over. But I need to ask you another favor. Find the bastard who did this.
Dandelion|Find him and kill him.
Geralt|Don't need any convincing.
Geralt|Come on, Dandelion. Let's think about what we can do. I--
Von Gratz|I would suggest examining the previous victim's corpse. It has yet to be autopsied. Doing so could very well provide some clues.
Von Gratz|No need to look astonished, gentlemen. As a surgeon I know the importance of preventive medicine. Rather than wait for this maniac to strike again, I'd prefer to excise him. Not unlike a tumor.
Geralt|Think they'll let me into the morgue?
Von Gratz|By the main entrance? Certainly not. But you can also get inside through the sewers.
Dandelion|The sewers… Travel them often, doctor?
Von Gratz|As often as required for, er… the pursuit of preventive medicine.
Geralt|Alternative treatments. Aggressive ones, I'm guessing. Interesting.
Von Gratz|We can discuss this en route. Are you ready?
Geralt|Mhm… Ready and intrigued.
Geralt|No. Need to tend to something first.
Von Gratz|In that case, we shall met by the Kingfisher. I'll await you there.
Geralt|Great analogy, but this "tumor's" not gonna sit there, wait to be excised. Appreciate the help, but I doubt you know what you're getting yourself into.
Von Gratz|I know perfectly well. And I assure you, I can take care of myself.
Geralt|Easy assurance to make, harder to back up. Especially if you've spent your whole life wielding a scalpel, not a sword.
Von Gratz|Look at this scar. Don't be shy. Any idea what leaves such a mark?
Geralt|A flail… morningstar, maybe.
Von Gratz|What do you think? A blow sustained at the operating table? No? Let me repeat… I know what I'm doing. And I wish to help.
Geralt|Who coulda done this?
Von Gratz|That I do not know. I do, however, know she is not the perpetrator's first victim.
Von Gratz|Well, then? Ready for a stroll through the sewers?
Geralt|I can't do this now. I'm sorry. Gotta focus on Ciri, she--
Dandelion|Matters the world to you. You'd do anything for her.
Dandelion|Believe me, I know the feeling… Go. Good luck.
Geralt|I'll get whoever did this, Dandelion. Even if it's Hierarch Hemmelfart himself.
Dandelion|Thanks.
Geralt|I can help now.
Dandelion|Thanks, Geralt. Really, thanks.
Dandelion|Gods… Priscilla! Is she gonna live?
Dandelion|Geralt! Finally! Look what they did… I mean, who… Wait, the surgeon's here! Doctor… She'll recover, right?
<|endoftext|>
Von Gratz|Hear that?
Geralt|Been hearing it for a while. Draw your weapon.
Von Gratz|Blast it… I kill one, another takes its place.
Geralt|I know how you feel, believe me.
Geralt|Where to now? Up?
Von Gratz|Yes, it's not far now.
Von Gratz|Take the ladder.
Von Gratz|This is the place. Come, the quicker we take care of this, the better.
Geralt|Why? Got somewhere to be?
Von Gratz|Someone might disturb us. The coroner, for example… or Reverend Nathaniel Pastodi.
Von Gratz|Very well… We seek the corpse of a dwarven woodcarver.
Geralt|Human. Wrong body type.
Geralt|That's gotta be him.
Von Gratz|This one's a she. Remember, beards are no indicator of gender amongst dwarves.
Geralt|A dwarf, but the hands… Not a carpenter's. A banker's, more likely.
Geralt|Looks like necrophages got to this one.
Geralt|Let's keep looking.
Geralt|So, preventive medicine you practice in the sewers - what's that about?
Von Gratz|Think. Sewing up drowner victims can grow awfully tedious. Is it not better to nip the problem in the bud?
Von Gratz|I tried to get the Temple Guard to enter the sewers. Alas, to no avail. So I took matters into my own hands.
Geralt|At no charge? You damned idealists… Ruining the market for us witchers.
Geralt|Priscilla… how's it look? Give it to me straight, no sugarcoating.
Von Gratz|Her wounds will heal. But it's her voice that concerns me.
Von Gratz|Surely you understand what a terrible blow that would be to a trobairitz. Enough to strip her of the will to live.
Geralt|Any remedy for that?
Von Gratz|I fear only your friend Dandelion can be of help on that count.
Geralt|This isn't it.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Calluses on the fingers, sawdust in the beard, clothes sticky with sap. Must be our dwarf.
Von Gratz|Excellent… I trust you don’t grow weak in the knees at the sight of blood?
Geralt|Not a bit. Start the autopsy.
Von Gratz|Where?
Geralt|All right. Think I know enough.
Von Gratz|Enlighten me, please. Because I've still no notion what this is about. What the motive might have been.
Geralt|It's some kind of sick ritual… You saw it - burns in the eye sockets, cavity where the heart should be, scalding liquid … All centering on warmth, heat, fire…
Von Gratz|A fire eternal.
Geralt|It's a lead worth following. Any idea what his name was?
Coroner|Fabian Meyer.
Coroner|And I'm Hubert Rejk, the coroner. I've come to perform the autopsy, but I see you've done it for me, Joachim. As always, you interfere where you're neither needed nor wanted. Drag others into trouble in the process. Who is this?
Geralt|A student. Lifelong learner. Got a couple questions for you.
Coroner|Very well, speak. But be quick. Reverend Nathaniel has come by for an inspection. He'll be here shortly.
Geralt|Woodcarver's body - where was it found? It's important.
Coroner|Plan to investigate? Exciting. He died in his workshop, south of the market square, just beside the gate to Farcorners. That poor trobairitz was attacked there… city's abuzz about it.
Coroner|But the woodcarver, Eustace the corpse collector brought us the body. You should speak to him, saw him just round the corner, near… Oh, greetings, Your Reverence.
Nathanel|Who are these people? I believe I made it clear no one was to be allowed in. Under any circumstances.
Coroner|You did, but… They're friends of the deceased. Here to collect the body.
Nathanel|Out of the question. Show them out at once.
Coroner|As Your Reverence wishes. Gentlemen, follow me. You shall leave… via another route.
Geralt|You old friends?
Von Gratz|Hubert taught me the rudiments of medicine. Long ago.
Coroner|And not very well. You've still not mastered certain basic principles. For example, that a doctor's role is to treat the ill, not save the world.
Von Gratz|You've not changed a bit.
Coroner|A compliment?
Von Gratz|No. A statement of fact. Thirty years… and you've not changed a bit.
Geralt|Sure of one thing. This was punishment.
Von Gratz|Even the witch hunters don't engage in this kind of torture. What sin could possibly merit it?
Geralt|Only the murderer knows that. And it's the key to finding him… or her.
Geralt|No motive to speak of. Murderer's mad, plain and simple.
Von Gratz|Unfortunate. Such individuals are hardest to catch…
Geralt|Sorry… rather not share my conclusions just yet.
Von Gratz|I understand. For the good of the investigation. Will you at least share what you intend to do?
Geralt|Let's look at his head. Hair smells like it's burnt, like he was in a fire.
Von Gratz|Notice anything else? That his eyes have been scooped out, for instance?
Geralt|Those burn marks I see in his eye sockets?
Von Gratz|Yes. And some gray dust - ash, it seems. Very fine.
Geralt|Murderer gouged out his eyes. Then put burning coals in the sockets.
Von Gratz|So it seems. Looking at the wounds… it appears our woodcarver was still alive when it happened.
Geralt|Let's examine the mouth. Burns, blisters…
Von Gratz|Just like Priscilla's.
Geralt|See this? Incision made into the voice box.
Von Gratz|Indeed. So thin as to be nearly unnoticeable.
Geralt|A small, extremely sharp instrument. Scalpel?
Von Gratz|But why? The wound is too small to bleed. And there are signs of swelling. The murderer… I believe he performed a tracheotomy. So the victim wouldn't die too soon.
Geralt|Let's examine his torso.
Von Gratz|What have we here… Deep wound on the left side of his rib cage. And a scar the length of his stomach.
Geralt|Let's examine the chest wound. Yeah, heart carved out, wound cauterized.
Von Gratz|Wait a minute, there's something else.
Geralt|An egg, from an amphibian… A salamander? Scorched, but intact.
Von Gratz|I attended some lectures in herpetology as a student. Afraid I don't recall any amphibians that would lay eggs in corpses. So either Professor Cochran was deeply mistaken, or this is our murderer's doing.
Geralt|Look at the scar. Wound's long and thin - an incision. But the edges are ragged.
Von Gratz|Means nothing. Look, no swelling, no bruises. An old injury, perhaps an accident in the workplace?
Geralt|Open the abdominal cavity.
Von Gratz|Due warning - it will stink of rot.
Geralt|Once fought a zeugl up to my waist in sewage, so I doubt-- Wait. Smell's not rot.
Von Gratz|Formaldehyde. A medical novelty. Heavily diluted, it's remarkable at preserving organic tissue. In stronger proportions… it's more destructive than acid.
Geralt|Explains why there's no smell of decay… And why his throat's scalded.
Geralt|Look at his hands. These welts… rope burns, right? He was tied up.
Von Gratz|I'd expect so. No one could sit through such torture unless bound.
Geralt|Speaking from experience?
Von Gratz|Yes, that of a victim. Spent a year in the dungeons of Tretogor. Long story.
Geralt|Some other time, maybe. See the callus? Our dwarf wore a ring. But someone took it off him.
Geralt|See anything interesting on his legs?
Von Gratz|His right foot - the ankle's swollen, toenails broken. He clearly kicked something very hard… right before he kicked the bucket.
Geralt|Doesn't strike me as the right time for jokes.
Von Gratz|Apologies. We surgeons… we've a different sensibility.
Geralt|Mhm. And a different sense of humor.
Geralt|His genitals - we oughta inspect those.
Von Gratz|I sincerely doubt they bear any relation to the matter…
Geralt|We'll see. Pull down his trousers and… Shit.
Von Gratz|Syphilis, actually. Early stages. No sign of diffusion.
Geralt|Think there could be a connection…?
Von Gratz|Only as the killer's potential motivation.
Geralt|Right. Never mind.
Von Gratz|I see. You clearly find gonads fascinating. I fear I don't share your passion. Let's focus on other parts of his anatomy, shall we?
Geralt|Let's examine something else.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Why'd you cover for us?
Coroner|I was covering my own arse. If Reverend Nathaniel had learned someone had entered the morgue, then cut open a corpse without his permission, I'd be in deep trouble. But you didn't give that a thought, did you, Joachim? As ever.
Coroner|Well, while I don't approve of your willfulness, I also wish to see this murderer hang. So, should I learn anything new related to this case, I will let you know.
Von Gratz|Mhm. Thank you.
Geralt|Mighta told me you know the coroner. We could've skipped the trip through the sewers.
Von Gratz|I know him - thus I avoid him. I've said enough on the subject.
Geralt|Don't aim to press you.
Von Gratz|Thank you. I've nothing to hide… It's just an old wound. Unhealed as yet.
Von Gratz|What will you do now?
Geralt|Plenty of leads. Woodcarver's workshop, the corpse collector who found him, alley where Priscilla was attacked… Got work to do.
Von Gratz|As do I - at the hospital. I must return there. But I shall keep my fingers crossed.
Geralt|And I'll keep my eye on you.
Geralt|I decide when we're done with a subject. What's your connection to him?
Von Gratz|An old story… but if you insist. The student protests in 1242 - you've heard of them? I led them. Hubert, however, denounced me to the authorities. I landed in prison. There you have it.
Geralt|Nathaniel… Who is he?
Von Gratz|A scoundrel, a rogue. Like every man who wears the robes of the Eternal Fire.
Geralt|Most are scoundrels before they ever put on the robes.
Von Gratz|True in his case as well… Before he donned the frock, Nathaniel was a torturer. Delighted especially in torturing women.
Von Gratz|Later Hierarch Hemmelfart appointed him to oversee the morgue. He deals with the Temple Guard, supervises cremations, conducts funeral masses in the temple on the isle, and so forth.
Geralt|Mhm. Dream job.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|A brazier… This time of year?
Geralt|Human. Priscilla's?
Geralt|I know that smell. Formaldehyde.
Geralt|Man's footprint. The murderer's, maybe. Weight on his heel… Took a step back.
Geralt|Murderer fled before the guards arrived. Ran this way…
Geralt|Trail ends here. Strange. Even I couldn't jump this wall.
Geralt|Another empty formaldehyde bottle.
Geralt|Tracks just end… As if he… vanished.
Geralt|Not this way… Fled by the other door.
Geralt|Same wounds as the previous victims… Examination would be a waste of time. Gotta get to Crippled Kate's. Fast.
<|endoftext|>
Whistling Wendy|Grab 'im!
Whistling Wendy|Think you'll gut me too, eh? Up your arse, deviant! Whores can fight back! Argh!
Geralt|Calm down, I'm not gonna hurt you. What're you doing here?
Whistling Wendy|Gettin' vengeance! Well, why you starin'? Have you not heard killers always return to the scene of their crime? Me and my brothers are waitin' here to give him a warm welcome. For Priscilla. Almost did her in, the whoreson!
Geralt|I know. Here to look for clues, and find anyone who might know something.
Whistling Wendy|Fear I can't help you much. But I can tell you what I know.
Geralt|Think I know what happened here. Priscilla fought back, her assailant retreated - and knocked over the brazier.
Geralt|Someone must've heard it, maybe saw something, started hollering - guards showed up. Murderer didn't finish the job, didn't cover his tracks. Just collected himself and leapt over the wall. Trail ends there.
Whistling Wendy|You divined all this from a pile o' rubbish and a few prints in the mud?
Geralt|Do that practically every day in my profession. And practice makes perfect.
Whistling Wendy|True enough. Just like I can tell right off if a punter'll pay or try to wriggle out of it.
Geralt|That particular skill I could use myself.
Geralt|You and Priscilla friends?
Whistling Wendy|Friends? Nah. But she saw more than a stupid whore in me, treated me with respect. It mattered.
Whistling Wendy|I was lookin' to give up whorin', pick up a decent trade. But none would take me - not as a washerwoman, nor a servant, nor a cook. Felt like a leper, I did. But Priscilla… she was different.
Whistling Wendy|Agreed to put me in her play, you see. Lots of the other actors, they were afraid on account of her jestin' 'bout the Eternal Fire. Whistling Wendy on stage - can you imagine it? Well, dream's gone now. I'm back to workin' street corners.
Geralt|Sorry to hear that.
Whistling Wendy|You could do worse as work goes. Or so I tell myself.
Geralt|Priscilla wasn't the sole victim - you aware of that?
Whistling Wendy|Oh, dearie… 'Course I was.
Whistling Wendy|This didn't start yesterday. Others've died like this before. Beggars, street girls, orphans. But who'd have a dram of concern about them? Human rubbish. It's what the guards call us.
Geralt|Recall any names?
Whistling Wendy|They didn't have proper ones. "Baldy," "Curly," "Buns" - that's what folk called 'em. No friends, no families. Their bodies were burned long ago.
Geralt|Take care now.
Geralt|I gotta look around some more. Appreciate it if you didn't disturb me.
Whistling Wendy|Naturally. We'll stand aside, behave. But… do tell us if you find anythin' else here.
Geralt|And I got a murderer to catch.
Whistling Wendy|So? What is it?
Whistling Wendy|Hey handsome…
Whistling Wendy|That's him! Follow me, lads!
Whistling Wendy|How am I to know? Watch 'im - see what he does.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Mind if I go inside the workshop?
Dwarf Man 03|I've not even peeked inside since… since they found Fabian. But I'll open it for you if you want.
Geralt|Already know what happened. Fabian was in the workshop. Murderer attacked him there. They struggled, Fabian was overpowered… then tortured. For a time.
Dwarf Man 03|I needn't know the details. Truth be told, I haven't the stomach for 'em.
Geralt|When it was over, the murderer dragged Fabian to the courtyard. Then made a pyre of sculptures, set them aflame.
Dwarf Man 03|But… why? Why do all that?
Geralt|To teach a lesson. To him, you… the whole city.
Geralt|Had a look at your sculptures.
Dwarf Man 03|And? Lifelike, aren't they?
Geralt|Mhm. The women especially. Never seen a bust that size on Melitele.
Dwarf Man 03|Oh, aye - Fabian's handiwork. I told him - brother, tits like that would crush her back, whittle 'em down. He said nay, they'd sell better this way. Told me to shut me trap.
Dwarf Man 03|And sell they did. Till one sermon at the Temple, when the celebratin' reverend said that who so buys idols from the nonhuman Meyers sins twofold - as a heretic, and as a lecher. That was the end o' that.
Geralt|Tell me what you know about the murder. In order, in detail.
Dwarf Man 03|Twas like this. Had some work in Oxenfurt, and I was comin' home. Saw a plume o' smoke risin' over the city. Thought to meself, "Blast it, gonna miss 'em burnin' another hag!" But the smoke wasn't comin' from Hierarch Square… it was comin' from here.
Dwarf Man 03|See the soot stains? That's where they burned our sculptures. Folk gathered 'round the blaze… and found Fabian here, beside it. They'd already loaded 'im on the cart by the time I arrived.
Geralt|Talk to your neighbors? They see anything suspicious beforehand? Hear anything?
Dwarf Man 03|Claimed not to. But even if they had, they'd not 'ave helped. In Novigrad folk give bleedin' orphans in the street a wide berth so as not to stain their poulaines. What do they care about some dwarf?
Geralt|Your brother have any enemies? Anyone dislike him? Threaten him, maybe?
Dwarf Man 03|Nay… 'Twas Fabian who threatened this one lass.
Dwarf Man 03|Oh, he were a good dwarf, a craftsman like no other. But he were an incorrigible whoremonger as well. Whenever we'd put a bit o' coin aside, I'd say, "Let's buy some tools, quality timber." No. He'd grab the purse and head out whorin'.
Dwarf Man 03|Took to following one in particular. He'd say, "'Tis all your fault, dirty bitch, human dishrag!" - and other obscenities. Don't rightly know what that was about. Maybe he was in love with her?
Geralt|Know where I can find her? This… dishrag?
Dwarf Man 03|City cemetery. She died a few days back. Quietly, in her sleep. Her ponce said a fever took her.
Geralt|Fine, we've talked enough.
Geralt|Need to look around.
Dwarf Man 03|Be my guest. Just beware o' the dogs.
Geralt|Won't learn anything else here. Take care.
Geralt|Anyone home?
Dwarf Man 03|Begone! Or I'll sick me hounds on ye! Mauler! Striga! Come!
Geralt|Relax. I'm here about Fabian Meyer. Looking for his killer.
Dwarf Man 03|That's altogether different. Sit, ye stupid mutts, lie down! C'mon, come on in. Slowly now, lest they bite ye.
Geralt|So, who might you be?
Dwarf Man 03|The stiff's brother. Gus's the name. We ran a workshop together - "Meyer and Meyer."
Geralt|Mhm. What'll it be now - "Just Meyer"?
Dwarf Man 03|Nay, mate. I'll be closing it down now. Soon as I find a buyer for this shack I'll head home to Mahakam. Be nearer my family, or what's left of it…
Dwarf Man 03|So, whaddaya wanna know, what can I tell you about Fabian?
Geralt|Charming as beasts go.
Dwarf Man 03|Ye daft? Even I'm scared o' them. But better a barkin' dog than an evil man at your door.
Geralt|Got someone particular in mind?
Dwarf Man 03|Sure as shite. Bugger who did Fabian in.
Dwarf Man 03|Soon as they'd hauled his corpse off, I ran to a mate who raises fightin' dogs. Bought these two mutts. Cost me a chunk o' change… But I sleep sound, at least.
Dwarf Man 03|Aye?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Few prints… Murderer killed Fabian somewhere else, then carried him here.
Geralt|Arranged the body and set the statues alight. This was a spectacle.
Geralt|Blood stains.
Dwarf Man 03|That's where Fabian lay when they found 'im.
Geralt|Formaldehyde. Doubt Fabian used it…
Geralt|Something's missing… Can I look in the workshop?
Dwarf Man 03|If needs must… Wait a spell. I'll open it for you.
Dwarf Man 03|I'll get it open for you… Just don't know where I put the damned key.
Geralt|More blood stains. But not near enough to say he bled to death. Unless…
Geralt|Somebody got rid of the blood, left a few stains behind.
Geralt|Furniture got knocked over. This looks like it was kicked.
Dwarf Man 03|So? Find anythin' of interest?
Geralt|Statues of the old gods. Nothing but women… shapely ones.
Geralt|Eyes. Humanoid… completely rotten.
Geralt|Murderer dragged something heavy… Statues. Or a corpse.
Geralt|Embers. Murderer leaves them in the eye sockets.
Dwarf Man 03|How the hell'd ye do that?!
<|endoftext|>
Eustace|What, you hard o' thinkin'? Won't tell you nothin', freak!
Geralt|Talk. What'd you find on him?
Eustace|Ayyye. As you wi-ish.
Eustace|Triflings, baubles. Glass-beaded ring, handful of coins… And a letter. Look. Vellum - quality parchment, that. I'll wipe off the writin' and sell it as new.
Geralt|That's human skin.
Geralt|"Priscilla." Next victim's name. If you'd given this to the right person she might not've been hurt.
Eustace|Hm-hm, what the fuck do I care what happens to some Pruhsilly? We short o' wenches in this town?
Eustace|Oy, fuckin' hell! What was that for?
Geralt|For everything.
Geralt|Get outta my sight. Now.
Geralt|That hard-up for coin? Fine. Have some. Now talk. What'd you find on him?
Geralt|I'd advise you not to anger me. Or you'll get an inside tour of the crematory.
Eustace|Touch me, and the guards'll be hidin' your arse 'fore you count to three.
Geralt|To save a little shit like you? Doubt it.
Eustace|They's clever lads, more cleverer than you. They know Eustace, know they want me on their side. 'Cause you'll all die one day, and then I'll decide where your body winds up: a grave, the crematorium… or elsewhere.
Geralt|We'll meet again.
Eustace|Aye. When I load you into me wheelbarrow.
Geralt|You Eustace? The corpse collector?
Eustace|Aye. How'd you know?
Geralt|Hff. Fourth sense, I think it is. You bring Fabian Meyer's body to the morgue?
Eustace|Fabian? Fabian? Oh yeah, I remember - hah! No eyes, no heart - one of them, right? No purse, neither, as I recall…
Geralt|You search Fabian's body?
Eustace|Well, aye. Cast an eye in his pockets, heh, made sure nothing went to waste.
Geralt|I call a spade a spade - you rob corpses.
Eustace|An' I call a prick a prick - it's none o' your fuckin' concern. What, are you a tax collector? Piss off, mutant!
Geralt|One of them? So there've been other bodies like that?
Eustace|Hm, sure have. Beggars, street urchins and street walkers. One wench so portly I hadda cut her into pieces to fit her in me wheelbarrow. "Slippery Sow," they called her on account o' the--
Geralt|Some things are best left unsaid. What happened to the pieces?
Eustace|Whaddaya mean? Reverend Nathaniel ordered 'em burned. Every last one. Oh, a shame that was.
Geralt|Shame? Why? Actually, never mind. Another thing that's best left unsaid.
Eustace|Sod off. Don't know nothin' else.
<|endoftext|>
Coroner|Geralt, right? I'm glad you're here. Held off on the autopsy till you arrived.
Geralt|Nice of you. Especially given you didn't seem pleased about my previous visit.
Coroner|Because you came unannounced and in unfortunate company. I also had Reverend Nathaniel to contend with.
Coroner|Our spiritual caretaker has left the city on some important matter. And I know who you are, what drives you… I'm more than happy to aid your investigation.
Geralt|Let's start.
Coroner|Gladly. The wounds conform to the killer's modus operandi. The victim was bound and forced to drink formaldehyde.
Coroner|Next, the killer removed the eyes, placed burning coals in the sockets, then opened the rib cage and… What's this? A parchment? Made of human skin…
Geralt|Could be a message from the murderer.
Coroner|I can't be certain what this means… But I fear Patricia could be in danger. Mortal danger.
Geralt|Where is she? Tell me!
Coroner|She resides in an estate beyond the city. North of Oxenfurt.
Geralt|Gotta find her. Now.
Geralt|A message from the murderer. The name of his next victim.
Coroner|Gods… he knows no bounds. To attack Lady Vegelbud, heiress of such a prominent family.
Coroner|Do you know her?
Geralt|Yes. Even went to her estate once with…
Geralt|By the way… you and von Gratz don't exactly get along. Why is that?
Coroner|I had him sent to prison. You see, Joachim led the student protests in 1242. A senseless and brutal revolt.
Coroner|People were dying, witcher. Those who rejected liberty, equality and fraternity would be found in the gutter come morning… their throats slit from ear to ear, with surgical precision.
Coroner|Joachim had been my favorite student, but… alas, I had to do something. So I reported him. Then I left the university and found work in the morgue - where none care about my past.
Coroner|Whereas Joachim… oh, fate's ironies. Years later he was appointed head of the very ward I had founded.
Geralt|How old's von Gratz? Fifty? Sixty?
Coroner|Fifty-three, I believe. Why do you ask?
Geralt|You look a little young to have been his teacher.
Coroner|Not surprising. For years I've lived in the cold and dark, breathing the vapors of embalming fluids. In short, working with corpses extends one's life. Amusing, is it not?
Geralt|Choosing the lesser evil can be hard at times. Happen to know a thing or two about that.
Coroner|In that respect, this work has its benefits. I couldn't possibly hurt anyone here if I tried.
Geralt|Von Gratz told me all about you.
Coroner|Ah. Doubtless you've heard how I had the noble leader of the student protesters thrown in prison… But did you hear the protests were far from peaceful? Or did he neglect to mention it?
Geralt|Who's the victim this time?
Coroner|Joris Aquinus. A lecturer in theology at Oxenfurt Academy. Found this morning at his home… on a catafalque made of his books.
Geralt|Any titles in particular?
Coroner|It seems all the tomes dealt with the Eternal Fire. Treatises critical of the faith's doctrines.
Geralt|Yeah… a mortal sin in Novigrad.
Geralt|Not fond of Nathaniel?
Coroner|Very few people are.
Coroner|He's cruel and capricious. He stormed in here once, grabbed a scalpel I was sterilizing over a burner. Sliced my back with it - to the bone. Because I had forgotten to lock the storeroom.
Coroner|Hard to be fond of someone like that, wouldn't you agree?
Geralt|"Patricia Vegelbud."
Coroner|Fortunately Nathaniel had few questions. Any more might have meant trouble… serious trouble.
Coroner|Geralt, I mean no offense… But I'm in the middle of something. I shall let you know as soon as I learn anything that could help you.
Coroner|What are you waiting for, Geralt?! The murderer could already be at the Vegelbud residence!
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Yes, good fellow? If it's work you seek--
Geralt|Don't know that I'm all that good. Name's Geralt. Looking for Patricia Vegelbud. Her life's in danger.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|In danger? Come now. I saw mother this morning. She seemed sad, true, but in perfect health.
Geralt|No time to explain. Trust me. Please.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|I find this all very hard to believe… But you appear to be quite serious.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Please, follow me.
Geralt|I'm hunting a serial killer. And I've got reason to believe your mother'll be his next victim.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Why, even if it's true, our guards--
Geralt|He's exceptionally cruel when he kills. Tortures his victims. Cuts out their hearts.
Geralt|So let's see how she is. Just in case?
Geralt|A fire fit for Belleteyn. Except it's the wrong time of year.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|I mentioned mother seemed sad, do you remember? In fact… She's in the midst of a crisis of faith. A rather serious one.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|We'd been to Novigrad. Mother had seen the pyres in Hierarch Square… Uttered not a word on our way home.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|She had all the holy books, insignias, reliquaries gathered, taken outside and burnt. Then she locked herself in her room.
Geralt|We need to hurry.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Oh, Geralt! What a pleasant surprise!
Geralt|Not pleasant at all. I gotta see your mother. Her life's in danger.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Guard 03|We got 'im, Lady Ingrid! Wasn't easy, but--
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Lower that crossbow before you hurt yourself. This man is innocent.
Novigrad Guard 03|Forgive me. I saw 'im runnin', thought it was the killer fleein'--
Geralt|I was chasing him. And I'd 'ave caught him if you hadn't gotten in my way.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Out of my sight. At once.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Mother… Why did he do this to her? Why…?
Geralt|Murderer might've grown bored of prostitutes and beggars… might've wanted to see how the upper classes die.
Geralt|Ingrid… I know this is a hard time for you, but… usually, the killer leaves a note on the body, a note indicating his next victim. May I?
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Very well. But you shall be on your own. I do not wish to see her in this state. I do not wish to remember her like that.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|And… let her be the last victim. Please.
Geralt|Bruises, broken fingernails… She defended herself. Must be why it took him longer. And why he almost got caught.
Geralt|Here it is. "Sweet Nettie - Crippled Kate's." Growing bolder. Not just the name, but the place, too.
Geralt|Won't get away this time.
Geralt|Because she blasphemed the Eternal Fire. Only thing that ties her to the other victims.
Geralt|I don't know. Too early to draw any conclusions.
Novigrad Guard 03|There he is! Get 'im!
Novigrad Guard 03|Spread out! Murderer's still here!
Novigrad Guard 03|Don't try anythin', wise arse. Got this aimed straight at your back.
Novigrad Guard 03|Halt! 'Fore I put a bolt 'tween your eyes!
Geralt|Listen, you got the wrong guy.
Novigrad Guard 03|Save your trickery! Takin' you to the heiress!
Geralt|Ugh. Well, killer's already escaped. Lead the way, hero.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Guards!
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Murder!
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Stop the killer!
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Poor Woman 03|Mmmmmmmff! Mmmff!
Nathanel|No one will hear you, bitch. Not a soul.
Geralt|You, though - whole town'll hear you in a minute.
Nathanel|Yet again you disturb me. And I so dislike being disturbed.
Nathanel|I was to play with Sweet Nettie. Render her no so sweet. But I shall see to you first.
Geralt|Try it, you bastard.
Geralt|First, gotta tell me why you do it.
Nathanel|For pleasure. Satisfaction.
Novigrad Poor Woman 03|Mmmmmmmm!
Geralt|Achievable with whores in a lot of ways, many traditional. Doesn't take killing them. Trust me.
Nathanel|Who said anything about killing? I could stop at a few burns… Third-degree, but still. Mm, this rosy skin will roast quite well.
Geralt|Just can't listen to anymore of this shit.
Nathanel|No one's forcing you to, mutant.
Geralt|Spare me your lies. I've seen your victims, I know how they end. You don't stop… not unless someone gets in your way. Like I'm doing now.
Nathanel|What the fuck are you on about?
Geralt|Murder. You killed Fabian Meyer. Patricia Vegelbud. And many others.
Novigrad Poor Woman 03|Mmmff! Mmmmmmff!
Nathanel|Bollocks. You're mistaken, vagrant.
Geralt|Almost had me convinced. Almost.
Geralt|Found a message on Patricia's body. Led me here, to Crippled Kate's, to "Sweet Nettie." If you didn't leave it, who did?
Nathanel|I don't know… But I see we must talk. Calmly.
Geralt|Who knew you'd be here?
Nathanel|Strangely enough, I don't announce these outings far and wide. There's but one man who… But that's impossible. He treats even corpses with kid gloves.
Geralt|The coroner… Said you were busy. That you wouldn't visit the morgue. Gotta go after him.
Nathanel|Go - to warehouse twelve at the docks. He's there this time of day, procuring supplies. Formaldehyde.
Nathanel|I shall stay here. I've unfinished business with Sweet Nettie… After all, I paid in advance.
Novigrad Poor Woman 03|MMMmmmmmmm!
Geralt|You'll untie her, drop your coin pouch on the table, then leave here and never come back.
Nathanel|Yes. I will.
Geralt|Good boy.
Geralt|Then you'll pay again. For her, for all the other women you've tortured.
Geralt|Don't have time for you now. But kill her… and I'll find you.
Nathanel|Calm yourself. I shan't do her any… permanent harm.
Novigrad Poor Woman 03|Mmff! Mmmmf! Mmff!
Geralt|Be nice, or I'll shove that poker up your ass.
Nathanel|Go on. Take it from me… Freak. Mutant.
Geralt|What, no foreplay? No formaldehyde, coals in my eye sockets?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Run out of formaldehyde?
Coroner|I underestimated you. You almost caught me in flagrante delicto, now you've seen through my bluff with Nathaniel…
Coroner|Although… you've not divined all, I see. Had you, you would've drawn your silver sword.
Geralt|Who… What are you?
Coroner|A vampire - higher, of course.
Geralt|Good to know this was the work of a monster, not a human.
Coroner|Believe me. Worse things go on in this city than my little… spectacles. Far worse.
Geralt|Afraid you won't get the chance to tell me about them. 'Cause I'm gonna kill you.
Coroner|I last fought a witcher two centuries ago. I do hope I remember how it's done.
Coroner|And you? Have you faced one of us? No, you couldn't have. You'd not have survived.
Geralt|Got a reason for killing? A reason to torture?
Coroner|Hm, I thought you'd figure that out as well. The symbolism's rather obvious. Coals for those who are blind to the Fire. The egg of a salamander, born of fire, to replace their cold, doubting hearts. Fire down the throat that--
Geralt|Yeah, symbolism's clear. What's not is why a vampire would kill in the name of the Eternal Fire.
Coroner|Should be equally obvious - I concur with the Church's diagnosis. Novigrad is a fallen city, its population amnesiacs to the very concepts of decency and morality. So I decided to remind them. In a manner they'd be certain to notice.
Geralt|You're a sick fuck.
Coroner|I never expected you to understand. You're a cynic and an opportunist, I sensed it from the start. Ah well, this conversation has grown unpleasant for both parties… We must move to the next item on the agenda.
Geralt|Tortured logic.
Coroner|Yet logic nonetheless. I'm glad you perceived that, at least. Fight fire with fire, as they say.
Coroner|Give a thought to my victims. A lecherous woodcarver who'd spend his last copper on whores. An old countess who defiled symbols of the Faith. A trobairitz for whom nothing was sacred, nothing above ridicule.
Coroner|They did not deserve to live. But their deaths could be a lesson to others. Awaken them, scare them onto the correct path, the path to the Fire, to cleansing, to salvation.
Coroner|For you, I'm afraid it's too late. You are a man of little faith. I sense this.
Geralt|Mhm. But I'm pretty good with a sword.
Coroner|"Pretty good" might not cut it.
Geralt|There are other ways. Could've set up a soap box in Hierarch Square, preached from it.
Coroner|How funny. That's exactly what I did. But none listened. Instead they laughed, threw stones.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|How's…?
Von Gratz|Better. Right?
Priscilla|Y-yes.
Dandelion|Did you take care of… what I asked?
Geralt|Yeah. The witcher's way.
Dandelion|Thank you, Geralt. From me and Priscilla.
Geralt|Don't mention it. Nothing a friend wouldn't do.
Geralt|She's talking again. Nice surprise.
Dandelion|Isn't it? Professor von Gratz told me her wounds are healing faster than a troll's. Not the most flattering comparison but… encouraging. Maybe-- She might even sing again some day.
Dandelion|For now we'll try performing as a duo. She'll play the lute, I'll sing. "Dandelion and Callonetta." Got a nice ring to it, doesn't it?
Geralt|Sounds great. Good luck, Dandelion. On stage and off.
Geralt|Did my part. Your turn now. Take care of her, good care.
Dandelion|I will, you'll see. Treat her better than the dryads of Brokilon could.

Eternal Fire Guard 01|Where you scurryin' to, wretch? Let's see your pass!
Geralt|Pass? What pass?
Eternal Fire Guard 01|Kind of pass confirms you ain't no mage. Can't enter or leave Novigrad without it.
Geralt|Sorry. Don't have a pass.
Eternal Fire Guard 01|You'll scurry no further, then. Next!
Geralt|Hang on… How do I get one?
Eternal Fire Guard 01|Start by makin' an offerin' to the Church. Then you'll need three pure souls to confirm…
Eternal Fire Guard 02|Let him through. Here's his papers.
Eternal Fire Guard 01|Wha? But where'd…
Eternal Fire Guard 02|Not your concern. Back to your post.
Eternal Fire Guard 02|Regards from Sigi Reuven.
Geralt|Why've you shut the city gates?
Eternal Fire Guard 01|So's we can clean it of mages, witches and other scum that's crawled here since the war began.
Eternal Fire Guard 01|Aim to catch every last one of 'em, toss 'em on a flamin' pyre, like poxy livestock.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What's going on here?
Witch Hunter 01|Fungus in the city. We're scrubbin' it clean.
Eternal Fire Guard 02|Why you wincin' that mug like you stepped barefoot in dung?
Geralt|Mind your manners.
Eternal Fire Guard 02|Mind our--? Heh, be glad we didn't smash your snout, mutt!
Witch Hunter 01|Wait. Grab him. I'll teach him his place.
Geralt|Relax. I'm going.
Eternal Fire Guard 02|Hah! Look at that - tail between his arsecheeks!
Witch Hunter 01|Freaks're learnin' their place. Slow, but they're learnin'.
Witch Hunter 01|That's her!

Novigrad Trader 01|This is scandalous! You've kept us half the day! The fruit on my cart's rotting!
Eternal Fire Guard 02|Groan on like that and you'll be rottin' in the clink before the other half passes.
Novigrad Trader 01|But… I'm a law-abiding citizen. Human ancestry traceable through generations, not a drop of elven blood!
Eternal Fire Guard 02|Sure about that? Ears look a shade pointy to me… So you'd best lay 'em back.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Is this necessary? On the road all day and now…?
Eternal Fire Guard 01|Cram it, arsewipe.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|What?! Do you know who I am? I'm Jean-Baptiste the Third - yes, of THOSE Baptistes - and…
Eternal Fire Guard 01|All are equal before the Eternal Fire. And all burn the same in its flame.
Eternal Fire Guard 01|Take my advice, Shaun-what's-it-rhyme-with. Shut your gob and wait in line like a good lad.
Eternal Fire Guard 02|What you got there?
Novigrad Peasant 01|Dried mushrooms, sir. Come to sell 'em at market.
Eternal Fire Guard 02|Huh. Any magic ones?
Novigrad Peasant 01|Nay, never. There's boletes, goatheads, penny buns… No magic mushrooms - pth! Just our own, you know, for ordinary folk.
<|endoftext|>
Eternal Fire Guard 01|This one's still breathin'.
Novigrad Poor Man 01|Aye, it is, let it. Some still breathe as I toss 'em in the fire.
Eternal Fire Guard 02|Orders say not a living soul's to leave without a pass.
Novigrad Poor Man 01|We can wait till it dies. There's no rush.
Eternal Fire Guard 02|Where's Eustace? It was him always hauled the corpses.
Novigrad Poor Man 01|Aye, he did. Plenty more to haul now, so we work shifts. Crematory's fire roars day and night.
Eternal Fire Guard 02|Good. City needs cleanin'. With steel and fire!
Novigrad Poor Man 01|If you want it clean, let me pass. Got shit and puss leakin' from me wagon.
Eternal Fire Guard 02|Oh, aye… Right away.

Novigrad Nobleman 01|You've taken a third of my cargo! Who ever heard of such a tax!
Eternal Fire Guard 01|Tain't no tax, it's confiscation. Those goods might've found use in witchcraft.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|What?! My trade's in fragrances!
Eternal Fire Guard 01|Exactly. Make a fine base for potions.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|This is absurd! I shall complain to your commander!
Eternal Fire Guard 01|Oh, prime idea. He'll greet you with open arms… Maybe even put you up in the dungeon for the night.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|How much longer will this last?
Eternal Fire Guard 01|Till we inspect all the cargo.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|All?! I've got ten tons of sheepskins alone! Do you know how long that will take?
Eternal Fire Guard 01|No. And I don't give a fuck.
Novigrad Poor Man 01|Cap'n… It's no use. Let it go.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Last time I make port here, you'll see! I'd rather trade with those savages in Skellige!

Novigrad Thug Strong 03|We've no dealings with mages. I swear!
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Kept my distance from wizardry me whole life.

Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Don't know. I swear on me mum!
Witch Hunter 02|On your mum? Well, then we'll take her in for torture. Perhaps that'll refresh your memory.
Witch Hunter 01|Give me a name. Then I'll release you.
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|Told you, don't know any mages!
Witch Hunter 01|But surely you know someone who does. You can either help willingly… or after torture.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Jouke… Willem Jouke. Someone makes brews for 'im.
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|He's got kids.

Witch Hunter 04|Time to finish what that driver started.
Novigrad Beggar 01|Mercy… I…
Witch Hunter 04|Yeah, I know. You've five brats, need coin for bread, surgery and a ticket 'ome. Do 'im!
Witch Hunter 04|The two of yous! Sod off.
Novigrad Beggar 01|But master hunter, sir… we're not in no one's way, not botherin' a soul…
Witch Hunter 04|You're botherin' me. Git, or we'll put bolts through both your necks.
Witch Hunter 04|Well, well. Feignin' cripples, but they cut a fine figure runnin' when they need to…
Witch Hunter 02|They can run faster still. Loose one at 'em, you'll see.
Novigrad Beggar 01|No! Mercy! Spare us!
Witch Hunter 02|A miraculous recovery, there.
Witch Hunter 03|The Eternal Fire's grace knows no bounds, brother.

Novigrad Thug Weak 01|We've a problem, master witcher. Mate of ours got injured, and we can't seem to find him…
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Poor lad could bleed to death.
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|You've tracked many a monster… Would you sniff our friend out as well? We're willin' to pay.
Geralt|Why not. Short delay won't hurt.
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|Lead the way, master witcher. Quick as you can, though - poor lad needs help.
Geralt|Need some kind of lead first. Any clues?
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|Uh, yeah… He ran. Toward the port. Came out the sewers.
Geralt|Sewers? Should be an easy scent to follow.
Geralt|Sorry, don't have time.
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|Your choice. Lettin' easy coin slip through your fingers.
Novigrad Thug Weak 03|Gotcha, whoreson.
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|That was five stone of the purest fisstech you put to the torch. Do you know what it was worth?
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|All right, witchman. Take your coin, bugger off.
Geralt|Do what you will.
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Need no convincin' there.
Geralt|Leave him alone.
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|Wonder of wonders… A witcher defendin' a mage hunter? Next we'll have mice stickin' up for cats!
Geralt|I'm not joking.
Novigrad Thug Weak 03|Ain't you? Fine, we'll talk serious, then.
Novigrad Thug Weak 01|Oi, he's back. So, master witcher, prepared to help us after all?
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|Witcher, sir! Help a woman in need!
Geralt|What's the problem?
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|My house, something haunts it. It howls, rattles chains, shatters plates… I fear merely being there.
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|Will you see what sort of phantom this is? I'll spare no amount of gold!
Geralt|Sounds like a wight or a puffbow… Fine, I'll tend to it.
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|Thank you ever so much! Come with me… I will show you the way.
Geralt|Sorry. Don't have time for this right now.
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|No time to defend me from specters? What kind of witcher are you?
Geralt|A busy one.
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|Come back, Sir Witcher! If you shan't help me, who will?
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|Enjoy rummaging through others' possessions?
Geralt|Relax, I--
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|You're a thief, sir. Do you know the punishment for thievery in Novigrad? Severance of the hands.
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|I'm not done with you!
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|Thank you ever so much. Behold - your reward.
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|Then go outside, get some air. I've given you your reward, you've no reason to stay.
Geralt|Don't enjoy being tricked.
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|Tricked? I only said my house was haunted. I could not know it was hunters…
Geralt|Mhm. Except the hunters knew exactly who they were waiting for. Reeks of a trap to me.
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|Very well. Perhaps I've not been completely candid… Especially as I've no gold for the reward, either. Which does not mean you shall walk away empty-handed.
Geralt|So long - and be careful. Lots more of those… phantoms all over town.
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|Will you see what specter haunts me? I've gold, it's no object, I'll spare no amount!
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|You must go now. I've no time for you, I must gather my things.
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|Here… A key to a treasure. There are three in all. Follow the hunters to find the other two. I… must flee. Now.
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|You saved my life… I don't believe you wished to, but you did. A reward is in order.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Nobleman 02|Aaaaargh! Aaaaaah!
Novigrad Nobleman 02|Noooo! Mercy! I shall tell you all! Aaaaargh!
Witch Hunter 03|S'all right. I'm content just listenin' to you wail, now.
Novigrad Nobleman 02|The witcher?! It's him you should burn! He-e-aaargh! He killed your comrades! At the Vegelbud ball!
Witch Hunter 03|Riiiight, sure. A witcher at a noblemen's ball. Who else was there? Couple beggars, whores?
Geralt|I know you. Moritz Diefenthel, right? Triss' friend, didn't see the slightest reason to flee Novigrad.
Novigrad Nobleman 02|The same… just singed. I thank you, witcher. And I… appreciate I was wrong.
Geralt|Here's my advice, and it's good advice. Find Triss. Lame duck might still be willing to help you.
Geralt|Next time, just wail, call for help. Don't point me out, try to damn me, too… Go on, get out of here. Before any guards show.
Novigrad Nobleman 02|Help me! I beg you! Aaaaargh!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|I was worried about you. City's crawling with hunters.
Triss|I know. We had everything in place, we were ready to sail… but the hunters moved faster.
Triss|They locked all the gates, placed guards at every corner. All in one night. Then they started searching the city - street by street, house by house.
Triss|They stop anyone who seems even slightly suspicious. Mostly it's common folk with rabbit's-foot charms or lucky horseshoes… But sometimes they get it right, arrest actual mages…
Geralt|How can I help?
Triss|Everything's falling apart. I don't know where to start.
Triss|I should get all the mages to the docks as soon as possible, get them on board the ship. But Berthold and Anisse have yet to show up at the meeting point.
Geralt|Berthold and Anisse? Who're they?
Triss|A young couple. He's an alchemist, had a practice in Gildorf. She studied at Aretuza. I'm worried the people who hid them might've turned them in.
Triss|See. My hosts weren't all bad.
Triss|Now you understand my predicament?
Geralt|Mhm. Help two and put all the others at risk… Or go straight to the Kingfisher, abandon the two to certain death.
Triss|What do I do, Geralt?
Geralt|We should help Anisse and Berthold. To write them off like that… it'd be cruel.
Triss|Fine. But then we need to go now. Clock's ticking.
Geralt|Lead the way.
Geralt|Can't risk everything, everyone for two people. It's unwise… and immoral.
Triss|I was afraid you'd say that. Fine. Let's go to the Kingfisher.
Geralt|Triss. I can't do this, can't help. Ciri's in danger and… I'm sorry.
Triss|So am I.
Triss|Sorry. Shouldn't have said that. I understand. I'm hurt… but I understand.
Triss|I hope you find her quickly. I hope we'll all meet again someday.
Geralt|We will.
Triss|And if you change your mind, you'll find me at the Kingfisher. At least for a little while longer.
Geralt|Won't be easy getting to the port. Lots of guardsmen in the streets.
Triss|So we won't take the streets.
Triss|In case of trouble, we were all to meet at the Kingfisher. There's a passage into the sewers from the cellar, and apparently those can get you all the way to the docks.
Geralt|I know the Novigrad sewers. Won't run into any hunters there, but that doesn't mean it'll be safe.
Triss|That's why I'm asking you. I need you to find the way to the docks, clear the path for the others. And do it quickly. The hunters could figure out our plan any minute.
Geralt|High time you forgot about your fellow mages. Saved yourself instead.
Triss|Would you abandon Vesemir? Eskel? Lambert? Leave them behind just to save your own skin?
Triss|I understand, you're worried about me, but I can't just pack up and leave them all…
Triss|I know what awaits those who fall into the hunters' hands.
Geralt|Actually, this is the perfect time for a moral debate. We can start by setting some limits on self-sacrifice.
Novigrad Old Woman 02|Are you daft?! Want to get us killed?
Geralt|What's the problem?
Novigrad Old Woman 02|Wha--? Slaughters a hunter at our doorstep, and then asks what the problem is?! Ploughin' mutant.
Geralt|We can hide the corpse.
Novigrad Old Man 03|The whole street saw what happened. The guardsmen'll come. Turn us in!
Triss|Calm down. We've put you at risk, true. But we'll make it up to you.
Novigrad Old Woman 02|Give us the necklace and get out of here.
Geralt|Hands off, or I'll cut 'em off.
Triss|Geralt. You don't need to.
Geralt|I wanna. Grab your things and let's go.
Triss|When I need your help, I'll ask for it.
Geralt|What? Are you angry?
Triss|Argh… angry? No.
Triss|But they deserved the necklace. They risked a lot just by sheltering me.
Geralt|They took a risk, sure. For a hefty fee.
Triss|Yes. The thing is, they could've taken the coin and turned me over to the hunters. But they didn't, which was extremely honorable by Novigrad standards.
Geralt|Please, don't make excuses for them.
Triss|Geralt, we could debate morals, or any number of other topics, but I don't have time for that now. You saw what's happening in the city.
Triss|Stop. I'll take it off myself.
Geralt|Sorry… Didn't know if you wanted me to interfere.
Triss|I didn't. Their behavior - disgusting, I know.
Triss|I'm out of coin.
Novigrad Old Man 03|But you've got somethin' else, dear.
Novigrad Old Woman 02|Get out. Now!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Have you checked the sewers beneath the Kingfisher?
Triss|No. Didn't think we'd have to take that route.
Triss|To think, a year ago guardsmen bowed to mages they passed in the street.
Triss|Now we have to flee the city like rats.
Geralt|You could stay. You'd manage it somehow.
Triss|The others will never make it without me.
Geralt|No guardsmen or hunters in sight. Everything seems in order.
Triss|Or we're too late…
Triss|A patrol. We can't let them see us.
Geralt|Where's this hideout?
Triss|Not far, in the Bits. Now, quiet, Geralt. We'd rather not draw any attention to ourselves.
Triss|Dammit… Hear that? Something's going on.
Triss|We need to join the others. Soon as possible.
Triss|All for nothing. Let's go.
Triss|Stop. Hear it?
Triss|Geralt, over here…
<|endoftext|>
Dijkstra|I look forward to having friends in Kovir. Especially among King Tancred's entourage.
Mage 03|Shhh. Triss is about to speak.
Dijkstra|We'll talk later.
Triss|We've waited long to escape. Till we could make sure Kovir will take us, till we could acquire enough coin to hire a ship, till we could find a captain we could trust.
Triss|We've waited too long. There's no more time for hesitation. We must leave Novigrad today.
Sorceress 01|This is madness. Hunters stand on every corner.
Triss|So we'll get to the port through the sewers. Geralt will clear a safe path for us.
Mage 03|They'll catch us anyway. You'll see. They'll catch us, and kill us.
Triss|Perhaps. In which case we'll die with dignity, weapons in hand… Not tied to a stake, begging for mercy.
Geralt|Gonna enter the sewers now. I'll signal when the path's clear, you follow my trail. And don't stray from it, no matter what.
Triss|I will go with Geralt. You, Dijkstra, go to the port and see that everything's in order with the ship.
Dijkstra|On my way.
Triss|We'll meet there. I hope.
Geralt|Triss… really want to go with me? No offense, but--
Triss|Offense taken. Stop talking and lead the way.
Geralt|If the need arises, I'll defend you.
Dijkstra|You can also count on my help.
Mage 03|Yes… the help of a Redanian spy. Radovid's right-hand man.
Dijkstra|That was long ago, sir.
Mage 03|You raised that madman. You taught him to kill. You--
Triss|This is no time to settle past scores. End of discussion.
Triss|Geralt, wait a minute. I need to see who made it.
Dijkstra|Why the tears, my dear lady? You shouldn't worry yourself - it tarnishes your beauty.
Geralt|Guess you must've worried quite a bit.
Dijkstra|No. I was born ugly.
Geralt|You fleeing to Kovir, too?
Dijkstra|No, but I am helpin' the others set off. You know me… bleedin' heart and all.
Geralt|Yeah, I know you. You don't have a heart - bleeding or otherwise.
Dijkstra|Frankly, I'm surprised at your insight into my anatomy. But on a more serious note…
Geralt|It only start bleeding now? They've been burning mages for months around here.
Dijkstra|But only since recently on this scale. Besides…
Mage 03|Triss! What happened upstairs? Is everything all right?
Triss|No. Everything's not all right.
Mage 03|Triss, we were so concerned.
Triss|Right to be. Hunters were on my trail.
<|endoftext|>
Triss|Stop. Hear that? What is it?
Geralt|Rats.
Triss|Oh, my speciality, remember? You've got nothing to fear.
Geralt|Depends how many there are.
Triss|Dammit… That's a lot.
Geralt|We've gotta go down there. No other way.
Triss|Rats fear fire, right?
Geralt|Mhm. But Igni's not enough to--
Triss|Leave it to me.
<|endoftext|>
Triss|Did you have time to look around? How's the ship?
Dijkstra|Creaky piece of junk. Wood's rotting, sails're prone to rip like an old pair of knickers, and the--
Triss|Will we make it to Kovir?
Dijkstra|Provided you don't run into any storms.
Triss|I'll signal the others to come.
Dijkstra|Need any help? Can I play the violin for you, fetch some flowers or bonbons?
Geralt|What the hell's that mean?
Dijkstra|What… don't tell me you don't plan to beg her to stay?
Geralt|Why do you even care?
Dijkstra|I adore love stories. Especially the ones that end happily ever after.
Triss|Hunters! Hunters approaching!
Witch Hunter 04|Board the ship! We want them alive!
Geralt|Don't meddle in other people's lives.
Dijkstra|Sorry, I must. It's my profession. So… will you ask her to stay?
Dijkstra|Finally. You bloody took long enough…
<|endoftext|>
Dijkstra|You're an arse.
Geralt|What?
Dijkstra|An ass. An oaf. A twit. Didn't even try to stop her.
Geralt|I had my reasons.
Dijkstra|Course you did. You're an ass, an oaf, a twit.
Dijkstra|But even an arse can do the world a favor if one more enlightened tells him how.
Geralt|Ugh. Dijkstra… what're you plotting this time?
Dijkstra|What would you say - how many mages did we save? All together.
Geralt|Dunno, didn't count… Thirty, maybe, give or take a few.
Dijkstra|And how many would you say remain in the North? How many alchemists, healers, herbalists? Two thousand? Three?
Geralt|Doing a population count? Is that it?
Dijkstra|No. I'm concerned. In Novigrad, they had us, we were here… But who'll save those in Rinbe? Ban Ard? Ard Carraigh? Gulet? You know damn well that daft bastard Radovid won't rest till he's killed them all. Every last one. Yennefer and Triss included.
Geralt|Moving as speeches go. Now get to the point. Why're you telling me this?
Dijkstra|Because I want you to help me kill Radovid.
Geralt|I don't kill kings. Just not a regicide, rumors to the contrary be damned.
Dijkstra|I know. I'm merely asking for your aid in organizing the assassination. Someone else'll strike the blow.
Geralt|Ugh, Dijkstra… might not've heard this, though I'd find that hard to believe, but witchers are neutral on principle, so--
Dijkstra|Oh, bollocks. That's a convenient excuse you lot try to hide behind every time the temperature rises.
Dijkstra|It's grown hot, my friend, and it grows hotter still. Pyres burn in every city. For mages great and small - your female friends included. For nonhumans. For witchers, soon. Is that the North you espouse, the North you're prepared to live in?
Dijkstra|Silence, cards close to your chest… I understand. To slay a king - it's not exactly some bloody nekker contract.
Dijkstra|You think on this. Think on what I said. And if you conclude you'd rather change the course of history instead of riding its current to hell, you come find me. At the Passiflora, in the garret. I'll be waiting with my mates.
Geralt|I'll think about it.
Dijkstra|So long, Geralt.
Geralt|You that concerned about the mages of the world? Expect me to believe that?
Dijkstra|Actually, yes. But not because I'm sensitive or it gives me a heartache, true.
Dijkstra|To my mind, this systematic persecution is foremost a symptom of a far more serious problem: a madman rules Redania.
Dijkstra|I served Vizimir, Radovid's father. Was his head of intelligence for more than two decades. Together, we transformed Redania. Made it the North's most powerful realm. Any idea what made it strong?
Geralt|Its armies, I'd wager.
Dijkstra|And you'd bloody lose, you idiot. Mass mobilization, inciting peasants to take up their scythes, straighten them - where's the art in that? Much harder to build a strong state with healthy commerce, manufacturing, solid alliances, progressive science, and fair, independent courts that hand down just judgments.
Dijkstra|Vizimir and I managed to do just that - through years of fucking hard work. I will not sit on my hands as that little shit squanders that. Radovid the Stern, my arse. Radovid the Witless, I'd say.
Dijkstra|Will you help me, Geralt?
Geralt|Sure this is the right time, Sigi? Triss and I just--
Dijkstra|Spare me, Geralt. Witchers're stripped of feeling, not one emotion in that body of yours. And I've an urgent matter to discuss.
Geralt|Mhm. And that is?
Geralt|I'll ask again - got interrupted last time. Why the hell do you care who I'm with?
Dijkstra|If I say it's because I like you, want what's best for you, would you believe me?
Geralt|No.
Dijkstra|Wise.
Dijkstra|You should stay out of politics. I know it, you know it, and Triss knows it - which is not insignificant.
Dijkstra|Your other lover - not so much. She's cuddled up to Nilfgaard, and you'll follow her, as always. And one day we might find ourselves on opposite sides of the barricade. It'd be a damn shame…
Dijkstra|But, that seems a distant future to me. Right now we should talk about the more immediate.
Dijkstra|Well mate, at least you tried.
Dijkstra|A sorceress turned me down once. Want to hear the story?
Geralt|Go for it. What's the harm.
Dijkstra|As you know my heart fluttered for Philippa Eilhart, back when we both served Redania.
Dijkstra|One day, I doused myself in fragrances like a whore in a heat wave, put on a pinstriped doublet - they make you look slimmer, you know… And I went to her, told her, Philippa, we've so much in common, and so on. Know what she said?
Geralt|Pinstripes hadn't slimmed you down enough?
Dijkstra|No. She said she preferred women. So, I drank myself stupid and went out whorin'.
Geralt|There a moral in that story for me?
Dijkstra|No. An instruction: just do what I did.
Dijkstra|Later. Once we've spoken.
Dijkstra|No. She said--
Dijkstra|Geralt, turn around.
Geralt|Not in the mood for jokes.
Dijkstra|No, I'm serious. Turn around.
Geralt|Triss?! I thought--
Triss|So did I. But I changed my mind.
Geralt|Thank you. I'm… grateful.
Triss|Dijkstra, no offense, but…
Dijkstra|Leaving. Already gone.
Triss|Let's go somewhere. I know a spot where we can watch the ships.
Geralt|Lead the way.
Geralt|Good thing women can be changeable.
Geralt|Rather hear why the hell you care about my relationship with Triss.
Geralt|Men's fragrance… Acrid sweat… and chestnut balm for aching joints.
Geralt|Dijkstra.
Dijkstra|Ah, those witcher senses. Can't hide a damn thing from you lot.
Geralt|Same seems to be true for you. Will you ever leave me alone?
Dijkstra|Someday, sure. Once I no longer need you.
<|endoftext|>
Triss|Dijkstra, I don't know how to--
Dijkstra|No time for courtesies, my dear. Get on board.
Triss|One last farewell.
Triss|Thank you. I'll never forget what you did for me… And what we had together.
Geralt|I'll remember you, too. Always with a smile.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Miss Merigold!
Triss|Coming!
Triss|Take care… and give Ciri a kiss from me once you find her.
Geralt|Stay with me.
Triss|Geralt… not this again. Especially not here, not now.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Miss Merigold! We gotta sail!
Geralt|Please.
Triss|We had our chance, but… let it go.
Geralt|I… I love you.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Miss Merigold! We're castin' off!
Geralt|Let's try again.
Triss|I don't have the strength to try. If I was sure it would work…
Geralt|I'll miss you. Terribly.
Triss|I know how you feel.
<|endoftext|>
Triss|They're safe now, right?
Geralt|Yes. You can stop worrying. Really.
Triss|Oh, you're right. Just... hard to believe it's over and done with.
Triss|I've dreamt of this moment for months.
Geralt|This how you imagined things?
Triss|No. I imagined I'd be on the ship with the rest of them. And you'd be on shore, waving a handkerchief, maybe.
Geralt|I hope you don't regret it… that things have gone differently…
Triss|Well, they say Kovir's lovely this time of year… But I prefer you.
Geralt|Haha, not surprised. I'm pretty lovely this time of year, too.
Triss|I won't disagree.
Triss|We might still go there one day, when it's all over.
Geralt|I dunno. Kovir seems so far away, end of the world, really.
Triss|Hmm. Maybe you're right… So how do you envision our future?
Geralt|I'll be grandmaster of the Order of the Flaming Rose, you'll be High Priestess of Melitele. We'll live happily ever after, a horde of kids around us.
Triss|Oh no, won't get out of it that easy. I asked you a serious question. Where do you see us in… let's say, five years?
Geralt|I'd like us to keep moving, live on the road, wherever our legs carry us. You know, a month here, a year there…
Triss|Yes. Forgot you're not the type to settle down.
Geralt|That's true. I don't get attached to places. Just people.
Triss|I missed this Geralt, you know?
Geralt|Meaning?
Triss|The Geralt who's not afraid to open up to me. Tell me what he really feels, what he wants.
Geralt|What I want? Hm, one more thing…
Triss|Shhh. I know.
Geralt|This is how I see it. We're living in a small town, where everybody knows everybody else. You've got your practice… brewing potions, that sort of thing.
Triss|And what're you doing? Running around swamps killing drowners?
Geralt|No. I'm sitting on the porch in a rocking chair, smoking my pipe… listening to the clink of your vials as you work inside.
Triss|That simple?
Geralt|Mhm. That simple.
Geralt|Don't know. No idea, honestly.
Triss|Trying to weasel out of answering again. You rascal.
Geralt|No. It's just, instead of dwelling on the future, I'd rather live in the moment. Like we are now.
Geralt|That would mean balls and banquets and other boring things that start with a "b."
Triss|Mhm. But also baths, balms, body massages… You could make up for all those years you slept in the bushes and bathed in mountain streams.
Geralt|Sounds tempting. Would I have to give up being a witcher?
Triss|No. You'd take a monster contract from time to time, to stay sharp… Nothing too dangerous, though, so I wouldn't have to worry. And I'd be waiting for you…
Geralt|Let me guess… with a candlelit dinner.
Triss|Candles, sure. And a bed.
Triss|Actually… We've never needed either.
Geralt|Promise me one thing - you'll stop risking your life for others.
Triss|No.
Geralt|No? Triss, not a mage left in Novigrad.
Triss|But you're here.
Geralt|I can defend myself.
Triss|Well, from kikimores, griffins, bruxae… but not from the Hunt. You and Ciri'll need my help. And I'll be at your side.
Triss|Thank you, Geralt. For this… and for what you said at the port.
Geralt|I should've said it long ago.
Triss|So… what happens now? Afraid it's a bit too early for "happily ever after"…
Geralt|I've gotta find Ciri. I'm close… I will find her, or someone who knows what happened to her.
Triss|Where will we meet?
Geralt|Can only think of one place where both witchers and sorceresses are welcome.
Triss|Kaer Morhen.
Triss|Haven't been there in a while. So, I guess I'll see you, witcher. I'll miss you. A lot.
Geralt|I'll miss you, too.
Geralt|We'll get our happy ending. One day.
Triss|Yes. Somewhere, over hill and dale…
Triss|It's a cruel world we live in. It's hard to make plans. Even harder to invest any faith in them, though you might want to… badly.
Geralt|You were in an entirely different mood a moment ago.
Triss|"Hush. The spark expired."
Triss|Don't worry about me, Geralt. And please, be careful.
Mage 01|Look! They're signaling us! It's a message!
Mage 01|H… l… a… k… b… r…
Mage 01|Hl… Hlakbr? It makes no sense.
Mage 03|It's code. What did you expect?
<|endoftext|>
Witch Hunter 01|Merigold. And the witcher.
Witch Hunter 04|Planned on two pyres. Now we'll have four.
Novigrad Poor Man 01|This is them, just as I said. Ploughin' sorcerer and his whore. She's into the witchcraft, too.
Witch Hunter 01|Good work.
Witch Hunter 01|Take them!
Mage 01|No, I beg you. We've done nothing wrong!
Witch Hunter 01|Right. Hear that several times a day.
Novigrad Poor Man 01|What… what about my reward?
Witch Hunter 01|Reward? Ah, right… Got to go to headquarters for that. We don't pay out rewards.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|How much they pay you for them?
Novigrad Poor Man 01|Please, sir… Mercy!
Geralt|How much? A bushel of grain? A barrel of herrings?
Novigrad Poor Woman 01|Leave him be! I talked him into callin' the guard… They would've found 'em anyways. Then they'd 'uve burned us all!
Geralt|You have no possible excuse.
Novigrad Poor Man 01|Don't kill us…
Geralt|I'd never dull my blade on the likes of you.
Novigrad Poor Woman 01|Harber. Harber!
Geralt|Let's go.
Geralt|Get out of here, or you'll burn anyway.
Novigrad Poor Man 01|But… How's that?
Geralt|Guardsmen'll decide this was an ambush. You know the penalty for that.
Novigrad Poor Woman 01|But this is our home. We can't just…
Geralt|Do what you want.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|You all right? Can you walk?
Sorceress 03|Y-yeah… Yes.
Mage 01|I'll not leave here. I'm no fool!
Sorceress 03|Berthold…
Mage 01|Have you seen what's happening out there?! They'll catch us before we can reach the port… Catch us, and kill us!
Geralt|We're going. Now.
Mage 01|Go-going.
Triss|Thanks.
Geralt|I can't guarantee you'll be safe if you come with us. But if you stay here, you will definitely die.
Sorceress 03|He's right.
Mage 01|We'll hide somewhere… wait it out.
Sorceress 03|Darling… I beg you.
Mage 01|Shut up! I told you last winter we should leave. But no, that didn't suit you! Well, here's your comeuppance!
Mage 01|Anisse... Anisse...
Mage 01|No, no… I can't leave her.
Triss|Geralt… Help me.
Geralt|You have to come with us.
Mage 01|Yes… I must.
Sorceress 03|Yes… I must.
Geralt|If you stay, you die. Trust me.
Geralt|That's not what she would want.
Mage 01|What do you know? Huh! She was a stranger to you!
Geralt|Yes, but…
Mage 01|Leave me! Leave me alone!
Geralt|That's not what he would want.
Sorceress 03|Perhaps. But it's what I want. I've had enough hiding, fighting… Without him, there's no point.
Sorceress 03|No. No… Berthold…
Sorceress 03|Without him… I've no reason to.
Triss|I'm so sorry… But we have to go.
Triss|We tried.
Triss|Let's go to the Kingfisher. This time we can't blow it.
<|endoftext|>
Dandelion|In fact, you look terrible! Like you could really use some rest!
Cirilla|Gladly take some. Point me to a room.
Zoltan Chivay|Course. Come on, little swallow, I'll take ye.
Cirilla|Let's meet later, Geralt. I've a little matter to resolve. I'll freshen up, then await you in the square in Gildorf.
Geralt|Right.
Geralt|Anyone here besides us?
Geralt|Lodge of Sorceresses - Triss and Yen were supposed to gather the remnants.
Dandelion|They're working on it. Triss is upstairs, waiting for you. Yennefer's gone to Crippled Kate's.
Geralt|Yen? At that portside dive? Why?
Dandelion|Didn't inform me. Imagine that.
Dandelion|Ah, and that elf of yours moved into the Ruby Suite. Told me to tell you he's waiting, too.
Geralt|Gave him your best room?
Dandelion|He didn't exactly ask.
Dandelion|I'd prepared another room for him, but he blew past me and locked himself in the Ruby.
Dandelion|Hasn't peeked out since. Barely eats, drinks only water, and the only thing I've heard from him is, "I wish to know when Gwynbleidd and Zireael arrive."
Geralt|Thanks. Looks like I'll have my hands full…
Geralt|Anything happen while we were away?
Dandelion|Uh, Pretty Polly came down with a fever, Matt Oyster caught a knife between the ribs, and they're late delivering the Sodden triple mead…
Geralt|Dandelion…
Geralt|Just finished hunting down the Crones of Velen and a general of the Wild Hunt.
Zoltan Chivay|Well, you've had a busy morn, then, haven't you…
Geralt|Went to Kaer Morhen first, then Velen…
Dandelion|Leave 'em alone, Zoltan. Can't you see they're beat?
Zoltan Chivay|Dandeeelion! Ready some tankards! We've guests.
Dandelion|Geralt! Ciri!
Dandelion|When I learned Geralt had found you--
Cirilla|Glad you to see you in one piece, too, Dandelion.
Zoltan Chivay|Where've you two been?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Greetings, Triss.
Triss|Have you lost your mind?! You went after Imlerith by yourselves?! To the sabbath?!
Triss|How could you put Ciri in danger?!
Geralt|Come on, we came out of it fine. Can't say the same for Imlerith.
Triss|That's the sole comfort I find in this. But it's no justification.
Triss|You know what might've happened?
Geralt|But it didn't. I was there. Had the situation under control.
Geralt|Mind if we change the subject?
Geralt|Any success with the Lodge? Anyone out there willing to help?
Triss|It doesn't look good… Ida outright refused, while Francesca won't budge from her little realm with a war raging.
Triss|We don't know about Fringilla. Haven't been able to contact her.
Geralt|And the others? Keira? Margarita? Philippa?
Triss|Keira was seen in Velen at one point. No word of her since. She could be dead…
Triss|I sincerely hope we can contact Philippa and Rita in time.
Geralt|Know where they are?
Triss|Yennefer's looking into Rita's whereabouts. I have to figure out where Philippa is.
Geralt|So, learn anything?
Triss|A few things that could be interesting. Prefer the long version or the short?
Geralt|Guess.
Triss|In short, she was here, at this inn, under our noses the whole time. Transformed, seated on her perch, with a dimeritium band on her leg.
Geralt|Zoltan's owl?
Triss|Mhm.
Geralt|So why isn't she here anymore?
Triss|Because Zoltan lost her in a card game a few days ago.
Geralt|Kidding, right?
Triss|Sadly, no.
Triss|A man showed up here, fleeced Zoltan bare, then proposed they play for the owl.
Triss|Naturally, he won. Then politely thanked Zoltan for the game and left.
Geralt|Who was it? Know where he lives?
Triss|He's not from here. No one knows him.
Geralt|Great. We got any leads?
Triss|We have this.
Geralt|That Philippa the owl's feather? Thinking divination?
Triss|Specifically, hydromancy and a form of sortilege. We need a fountain where we won't be disturbed.
Geralt|One outside the Passiflora could work…
Triss|Good idea. Let's go.
Geralt|Need to take care of something first. Meet you somewhere later?
Triss|Fine. The fountain outside the Passiflora. And… hurry, please.
Geralt|Don't you think we oughta get Keira first?
Triss|Hmm… Right…
Triss|Meet you on the main square at night.
Geralt|Yup. That's Zoltan for you…
Geralt|Tell me everything. I want the details.
Triss|After fleeing Loc Muinne Philippa ended up here in Novigrad. She sought help from her former lover - the sorcerer Arthur de Vleester.
Geralt|Philippa and a former lover? Something tells me "happily ever after" is not how that story ends.
Triss|Philippa'd made a fool of him once. Arthur was out for revenge. He convinced her she'd be safest as an owl. She transformed, and he placed a dimeritium band on her leg.
Triss|The mage hunts started shortly afterwards. Sadly, Arthur fell victim. They auctioned off his estate.
Triss|Just so happens a certain dwarven acquaintance of ours stumbled on the auction…
Geralt|Zoltan. Huh. So Philippa was here, under our noses, the whole time?
Triss|"Was" - precisely. Zoltan lost her in a card game a few days ago.
Geralt|De Vleester? Rings a bell…
Geralt|Know what Yen's found out?
Triss|You'll need to ask her, I've been busy trying to find Philippa.
Geralt|We will. We have to.
Triss|I'll rest easier when they're both here, with us.
Geralt|What about Philippa?
Triss|Did a little investigating, learned some interesting things.
Geralt|Namely?
Triss|Want the long or the short version?
Triss|Keira?
Triss|I thought you of all people'd know…
Geralt|I've seen worse matches… Hope things work out for them.
Triss|I hope they work out for us, and we actually find Philippa and Rita.
Triss|And I hope things work out for us, and we find Philippa and Rita.
Triss|Keira… thought too much of her charm. Tried to buy her way into Radovid's graces, offered to make a powerful weapon for him…
Triss|I tried to talk her out of it, but she refused to listen…
Triss|Radovid laughed in her face, ordered her captured, then… impaled. Nothing I could do…
Geralt|Just his style… Coulda had her hanged, decapitated - even a burning pyre would've been a quicker death.
Geralt|He wanted to watch her suffer…
Triss|Before we leave, we have to bury her. I won't let crows pick her rotting flesh off a stake.
Triss|I can do that much, at least…
Geralt|Guards'll hand over the body given the proper incentive.
Triss|I really hope we contact Philippa and Rita - before they meet a similar fate.
Triss|I hope we can reach Philippa before she meets a similar fate.
Geralt|Keira played with fire. Had to know she might get burned.
Triss|Singed hands, maybe… but impaled?
Geralt|Don't blame yourself. Keira wasn't one to listen to reason.
Geralt|You can count Keira out…
Geralt|Yen and I rescued Margarita.
Triss|I know. Dandelion set her up in a room upstairs. She's resting, slowly recovering.
Geralt|What about Keira and Philippa?
Geralt|Damn shame Keira won't be here to help…
Triss|True, but there's still a chance we'll find Philippa.
Geralt|Town's decked in Radovid's colors. And we passed a sizable force of witch hunters on the way in.
Triss|Novigrad's a lost cause. Unless by some miracle the emperor takes the city.
Geralt|Hm, never thought of mages as fond of Emhyr.
Triss|Better predictable Emhyr and his semblance of freedom than crazy Radovid, brimming with hatred for anything even remotely related to magic.
Geralt|Passed burning pyres on the way into town. Nonhumans on them.
Triss|Things grow worse by the day. No mages left in the city, so the hunters had to find someone else to victimize.
Triss|We need to resolve everything as quickly as possible and leave Novigrad.
Geralt|Yeah. But I'd never let Ciri come to any harm. You know that.
Geralt|Shouldn't have… I'm sorry.
Triss|It ended well, luckily. But it didn't have to.
Geralt|I know. But Imlerith's gone. That's what matters.
Geralt|Besides, I was there the whole time. Had the situation under control.
Geralt|Besides, I'd never let anything happen to Ciri. You know that.
Geralt|Ciri had to do it. I couldn't let her go alone.
Geralt|You'd have done the same in my boots.
Geralt|I'm back.
Triss|Great, let's go find the fountain.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What was her crime?
Novigrad Guard 02|Same as all of 'em! Witchcraft and fornication with succubi!
Novigrad Guard 03|Cunt tried to seduce Radovid. But he saw through her. Showed her what we do to traitors.
Geralt|Take your friend and go for a walk.
Novigrad Guard 03|Perhaps we've earned a break…
Novigrad Guard 02|Aye, high time…
Geralt|Get outta here. Both of you.
Novigrad Guard 02|Don't rightly believe you know who you're talking to.
Geralt|Oh, I do - two idiots. Soon to be two dead idiots.
Geralt|Here to take the body.
Novigrad Guard 03|First we've heard of anyone collecting it.
Novigrad Guard 02|Guard the witch, those're our orders.
Geralt|So long.
<|endoftext|>
Triss|Let's begin.
Triss|Observe the water's surface carefully. We can't let anything go unnoticed.
Triss|Greame et dwyr! Rhobeir'me gelle a failte!
Triss|Greame et dwyr! Deagnis cair-lle ess pyr'shena a et cleytte!
Geralt|Looks familiar… A bathhouse. I know the place.
Geralt|Dijkstra!
Geralt|He has her. At his bathhouse.
Geralt|Might've guessed as much.
Geralt|Let's go to the bathhouse, might not be too late.
Triss|Come on.
Geralt|Was that the past or the future?
Triss|The recent past. We have to hurry.
Triss|That was the recent past. Anything might happen to her in Dijkstra's hands. Let's go.
Geralt|Not so fast. The first image… What was that?
Triss|Nothing, really.
Geralt|Don't brush me off. I know how hydromancy works. Image appeared because you're thinking about it.
Triss|It was… King Tancred asked me to become his court advisor, in Kovir.
Geralt|Did you accept?
Triss|Only a fool would refuse.
Triss|Tancred's been supportive of the mages from the start. The evacuation was only possible with his help!
Triss|Now he wants to revive the Council and the Conclave. And I'm to head both.
Geralt|The vision was of a house, not a royal court…
Triss|It's the house that awaits us in Pont Vanis.
Triss|When we're done here, when all this is over, once we've defeated the Hunt and Ciri's safe, I'd like us to live there. Together.
Geralt|Guess you've got everything planned out…
Triss|You don't like it?
Geralt|I like it. A lot.
Triss|Ha… I'll tell you the details later. Right now we need to get Philippa.
Geralt|Right.
Geralt|I'm… surprised… Don't really know what to say…
Triss|You don't need to decide right away.
Triss|But I'm glad you know. I was afraid how you'd react. It's a big deal, resettling, to a permanent home.
Triss|If you don't want this, I'll turn it down. What I really want is to be with you, to.. to be together and…
Geralt|Triss?
Triss|Yes?
Geralt|We'll be together. And you don't need to turn anything down.
Geralt|I dunno, Triss…
Geralt|The life of a witcher, it's no fairytale. But I like being on the Path, sleeping under the stars, waking up with dew on my face…
Triss|I'm not asking you to sacrifice anything. You're not cut out to be a courtier, I know that…
Triss|You can set out on the Path whenever you want, for however long you want…
Triss|It's just… you'll have somewhere to come home to.
Geralt|Always used to be Kaer Morhen… House in your vision looks a lot cozier…
Triss|We talked about this, remember? In the lighthouse.
Geralt|Tancred's picked a strange battle… All the North's hunting down mages, and he's out to revive the Council?
Triss|These are troubled times, and Tancred could be alone in remembering that mages are a powerful force.
Triss|And that we know how to show gratitude.
Geralt|It's a great opportunity… Congratulations…
Triss|You don't exactly sound thrilled…
Geralt|Bit worried, that's all. You really ready to dive into politics again?
Triss|I wasn't sure at first… Ultimately, though, it's something I've always dreamed of.
Triss|The dreams' within reach now. I'm not about to let it go.
Geralt|You deserve it. Best decision Tancred ever made.
Triss|Thank you. I hope I can rise to the task.
Geralt|You will. With you leading it, the Council might actually do some good, start helping people.
Geralt|Huh. Hope you turned him down…
Triss|I didn't… I said yes.
Geralt|Triss… These last few months, they've really taught you nothing?
Geralt|Generous offer. Hope you took it.
Geralt|What's that?
Triss|Uhh… nothing. A preliminary image.
Geralt|What?
Triss|Stop interrupting! I have to focus.
Geralt|You mentioned Kovir in the lighthouse. I understand why, now…
Triss|Sure you weren't followed?
Geralt|Yeah.
Triss|We're here.
Geralt|Nice and quiet. Shouldn't be any disturbances.
<|endoftext|>
Triss|I sense strong magic.
Triss|We have to get inside.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|At him!
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Kill the freak!
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|Die, mutant!
Geralt|Damn, she cast a spell on them.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Wha… What's happenin'?
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|W-w-witcher. He's gotta die.
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|Kill the witcher.
Triss|I hope we get there in time. I hope Dijkstra hasn't already hurt her.
Geralt|The possibilities are many. Could be Dijkstra that got hurt.
Triss|Not likely. Dijkstra never forgave her for sending assassins after him. And Philippa's weakened, no doubt about it.
Geralt|Weakened, maybe, but still a powerful sorceress.
Geralt|If Dijkstra's men take the dimeritium off, Philippa'll kill them before they can say "Oh shit."
<|endoftext|>
Dijkstra|Surrender!
Dijkstra|This place is a maze, witch! You'll never get out!
Dijkstra|Goddamn fools! After her!
Geralt|We'll handle this.
Dijkstra|Oh, no! No, no! The sorceress stays here.
Geralt|Stay here, Triss. In case she tries to flee this way.
Triss|Be careful. She might be blind, but she's still dangerous.
Triss|And don't hurt her.
Geralt|We're going together.
Dijkstra|Not a chance.
Triss|It's fine, Geralt, I'll stay. In case she tries to flee this way.
Geralt|Fine. Be right back.
<|endoftext|>
Cyclops|Witcher no pastgo. Perty birdy nosay.
Geralt|Dammit, cast a spell on him too.
Geralt|I need her. Gotta catch her.
Cyclops|Birdy want no you her catch.
Geralt|Get out of my way before things get unpleasant.
Cyclops|Bart no can do. Bart promise.
Geralt|You asked for it.
Geralt|She's hurt, did you see that? I wanna help her.
Cyclops|Birdy no pastgo say. Bart no let pastgo.
Geralt|Hmm… Ever had a stomach ache?
Cyclops|Hmm… Ache, aye. Bart once old drowner eat.
Geralt|Her stomach aches like she just ate a hundred old drowners.
Cyclops|Bart no want… Drowner make ache very bad…
Geralt|Let me pass. I can help her.
Cyclops|Hmm… Bart let pastgo… Witchar help.
<|endoftext|>
Philippa Eilhart|I'll never be imprisoned again! Never!
Philippa Eilhart|You shan't take me alive!
Geralt|Triss is waiting by the exit!
Geralt|We wanna get you outta here!
Philippa Eilhart|To surrender me to Radovid? I'd sooner die!
Geralt|I'm not your enemy!
Geralt|Came to ask for your help!
Geralt|Gotta avoid hurting her.
Geralt|Damn rubble. Loud as a herd of rabid trolls.
Philippa Eilhart|What's happened? So quiet, all of a sudden?
Philippa Eilhart|Aha! There you are!
Philippa Eilhart|Go back! Leave me in peace!
<|endoftext|>
Dijkstra|Deepest apologies, but the lady will come with me.
Geralt|Dijkstra… I don't have time for this, get out of my way.
Dijkstra|I've no quarrel with you, Geralt. But Phil and I have lots to talk about…
Dijkstra|Remember the assassins you sent after me, darling Phil? A grave error. Such matters ought to be handled personally.
Dijkstra|As I will now demonstrate.
Geralt|Not gonna demonstrate a damn thing. I need her.
Dijkstra|And I don't give a flying fuck.
Dijkstra|I've awaited this moment forever, so, very sorry, but I care as much about your plans as I do about the snows of Mahakam.
Dijkstra|Philippa will come with me. And answer for all the courtesies she's paid me.
Geralt|Always knew the value of information, Dijkstra…
Dijkstra|Which is why I don't believe you have anything I don't already know.
Geralt|The emperor of Nilfgaard wasn't able to sway the Trade Corporation.
Dijkstra|Opposition nibbling at his arse, eh? Hm, seems the White Flame won't dance on the graves of his foes much longer.
Geralt|His daughter has returned. The emperor wants to abdicate, give her the throne.
Dijkstra|Cirilla? Impossible! This… this could shift the tide of war…
Dijkstra|But what's Philippa got to do with it?
Geralt|Philippa will help us protect Ciri from the Wild Hunt.
Dijkstra|…
Dijkstra|Go. Before I change my mind.
Dijkstra|Provided, of course, you're not mistaken…
Geralt|Emperor himself told me, so… information's first hand.
Dijkstra|Emhyr's a lying whore.
Geralt|When it comes to his daughter's future? Doubt it.
Dijkstra|You've no idea of the importance of this information. A change on the imperial throne? Could bring the war to an end.
Dijkstra|Radovid's sure to be delighted. If Emhyr sounds the retreat, there'll be no force left that could possibly stop that madman.
Dijkstra|Especially in light of our bloody aborted plan.
Geralt|You didn't actually believe you could do it? Radovid's crazy but he's no idiot. Knows all too well there're dozens out there who'd--
Dijkstra|Silence.
Philippa Eilhart|Do I understand you correctly? You want to kill Radovid? Well, well, Sigi, I am impressed. Doubted you still had it in you, frankly.
Philippa Eilhart|Sadly, as you well know, Radovid has sought refuge on his boat. He's guarded so closely I'd not be at all surprised to learn he shares his bed each night with two sentries.
Dijkstra|You know too much, Phil. Yet one more reason why you must die.
Geralt|Think you might wanna hear her out? Daresay Philippa despises Radovid at least as much as you do.
Philippa Eilhart|I'm content someone apart from myself has finally gotten the idea to rid the world of the degenerate.
Dijkstra|Save your praise for others. I couldn't give a shit.
Philippa Eilhart|Currently, only two individuals stand to draw Radovid off of his boat. Emhyr… and myself.
Geralt|You'd agree to be the bait?
Philippa Eilhart|I fear you'd be hard pressed to convince Emhyr to dangle himself as such…
Dijkstra|Fat fucking chance! Geralt, I wouldn't trust this cunt to hard boil my eggs!
Philippa Eilhart|Rightly so - I'm terrible with eggs. But think on this: Radovid hears that you've captured me… Will he not throw caution to the wind? Will he not jump at the chance to kill me… personally… with his bare hands?
Dijkstra|Out of the question! Geralt, get her out of here before I burst a testicle!
Dijkstra|And then… then we must meet. With our friends. I've leased a warehouse portside. Be sure to come.
Geralt|Dijkstra, Philippa's not gonna die - we're done discussing that. Forget about it.
Dijkstra|Situation's changed, witcher. She's in a position now to foil my plans.
Philippa Eilhart|Do you really think I will run to warn the man who gouged my eyes out?
Geralt|Time'll tell if I am or not.
Dijkstra|Except if you are talking bollocks, and I swallow it whole, well… it'll be too late.
Geralt|Guess you gotta take that risk.
Geralt|Sorry. Can't let that happen.
Dijkstra|Oh! Aaa-aaa-aaargh!
Dijkstra|No, no - not my leg!
Dijkstra|Arrrrgggghhhh!
Geralt|I like you, Dijkstra. Don't make me hurt you.
Dijkstra|Save your threats for the rats that run about the port. They don't make the slightest impression on me.
Geralt|I remember your little… bond, but this is no time for a lovers' quarrel.
Dijkstra|But it's an excellent time to settle a score.
Geralt|Stop squirming. If I wanted to kill you, you'd be long dead by now.
Philippa Eilhart|What do you want? To torment me? To watch others do so?
Geralt|I need your help.
Philippa Eilhart|Betray me and I will--
Geralt|Relax. Not planning on it. Triss is outside, she'll explain everything.
<|endoftext|>
Triss|Sorry to take so long, but I had to deal with the guards.
Philippa Eilhart|Hello, Triss.
Triss|Philippa, are you all right?
Philippa Eilhart|I've been better.
Triss|I'll get you out of here.
Geralt|Gonna be all right?
Triss|Yeah, thanks for your help.
Triss|Meet me at night in the main square. We have to take care of Keira.
Geralt|See you then.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Wrong direction. Whoreson's headquartered on Temple Isle.
Cirilla|So I thought, but I think we should check something first.
Cirilla|Zoltan claims the word in town is we're more likely to run into Whoreson around here.
Geralt|Lead the way.
Geralt|Bit late for that. He's dead.
Cirilla|I asked Zoltan, and he said Whoreson's alive and well on Temple Isle.
Geralt|I was there, stuck a sword in his gut.
Cirilla|Your hand must've slipped, because it seems he's recovered.
Geralt|Lead the way.
Cirilla|Almost there.
Geralt|Where are we going exactly?
Cirilla|To see Whoreson Junior.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Couldn't help it. Grew curious about this "little matter" you have to resolve.
Cirilla|When I was last in Novigrad I had my share of troubles…
Geralt|So I heard.
Cirilla|A few people helped me then, others… not so much. Now I mean to repay them both.
Cirilla|Coming with?
Geralt|Lead the way.
Cirilla|We'll start with the Bits.
Geralt|Who're we gonna visit?
Cirilla|You'll see…
Cirilla|We need to go to Temple Isle.
Geralt|Don't remember you being religious…
Cirilla|Nor am I now. Let's go.
Geralt|Love to accompany you, but I gotta do something first.
Cirilla|In that case I'll await you there - the market in Gildorf.
Cirilla|No problem, I'll wait here.
Geralt|Looking for something in particular?
Cirilla|Hmm. A pretty little trinket…
Geralt|Wanna give someone a present?
Cirilla|One of the people I told you about… A gesture of gratitude.
Cirilla|Can we go?
Cirilla|Ready?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Why're you doing this again?
Cirilla|I want to look him in the eyes.
Geralt|What then?
Cirilla|Don't know. Depends what I see.
Cirilla|A friend of Dandelion's. Her name's Bea.
Cirilla|She's a waitress at the Golden Sturgeon.
Cirilla|Helped me contact Dandelion.
Cirilla|I wish to thank her. She risked a lot.
Geralt|Risked a lot? How's that?
Cirilla|The Temple Guard were breathing down my neck.
Cirilla|If she'd been seen with me, she might've been flogged, or worse.
Geralt|Always getting into trouble…
Cirilla|I take after you.
Geralt|Where's this friend of yours?
Cirilla|Hmm… There!
Cirilla|Valdo!
Geralt|I'm here.
Cirilla|Did you lose your way?
Geralt|No. You just run too fast.
Cirilla|Or you've gotten old.
Cirilla|Shall we?
Geralt|Sure, lead the way.
Geralt|Wait, just remembered something. Be right back.
Cirilla|I'll wait here.
Geralt|Why're are we going to the Sturgeon?
Cirilla|To see a girl who helped me once.
Geralt|Who might that be?
Geralt|This girl we're going to see - who is she again?
Cirilla|See you outside the Golden Sturgeon!
Cirilla|See you in Farcorners!
Geralt|What's there to see in Farcorners?
Cirilla|The camp of some traveling circus performers. Nonhumans.
Cirilla|When I came here before, I wanted to contact Triss.
Cirilla|Life was hard. I quickly spent nearly everything the baron gave me.
Cirilla|Triss and I never met, because the Temple Guard showed up.
Cirilla|I was a wanted woman afterwards.
Geralt|Triss didn't try to contact you?
Cirilla|How could she? She didn't know anything.
Cirilla|In fact, she thought she was to meet another alchemist wanting to flee Novigrad.
Cirilla|I preferred not to put her in danger.
Cirilla|I was being hunted, had not a copper to my name.
Cirilla|Then I met Valdo.
Cirilla|He and his troupe helped me, then introduced me to Bea, and through Bea I found Dandelion.
Cirilla|You know the rest.
Cirilla|That was… strange.
Geralt|To say the least.
Cirilla|I wonder what they're doing.
Geralt|We'll know soon enough.
Geralt|So, your friend... Bea…
Cirilla|What about her?
Geralt|Nothing, seems nice…
Cirilla|Geraaalt, you're terrible.
Geralt|What'd I say?
Cirilla|I'll meet you there!
Cirilla|At last, there you are!
Cirilla|I visited a city once that was very much like Novigrad.
Cirilla|But the people there were much taller and had dark skin.
Geralt|This somewhere in Zerrikania?
Cirilla|No. In another world.
Geralt|Hmm… What's it like, hopping between worlds?
Geralt|Anything like passing through a portal? Or different?
Cirilla|A bit different.
Cirilla|It was hard going at first.
Cirilla|I wasn't very good at controlling it. So I had to concentrate intensely and hope I didn't land in the crater of an active volcano.
Cirilla|The training I did with Avallac'h was very helpful.
Cirilla|Now I merely think of the place I wish to travel to, close my eyes - and it's done.
<|endoftext|>
Cyprian Willey|Well, well, who do we have here?
Cyprian Willey|Finally found your little ward. Took your sweet fuckin' time.
Cirilla|Seems in fine health to me.
Cyprian Willey|Ahhh, 'cause you thought you'd killed me that time. Surprise, sur-fuckin'-prise.
Cyprian Willey|Shut your trap, witch, afore somebody fills that hole for you!
Cirilla|Enough.
Cirilla|I'll finish what you started.
Cyprian Willey|Whoa-ho, stop! It's me, Dudu! Dudu Biberveldt! You really didn't recognize me?
Cirilla|Dudu?
Geralt|Wait, Ciri.
Geralt|After the heist, after Dijkstra's vault was emptied, you vanished. How'd I find you? Quick.
Cyprian Willey|Butchers' Yard - the mummers' play, Priscilla's. You dragged me onto the stage.
Geralt|Sheathe your sword, Ciri. It's Dudu.
Cyprian Willey|Gods! You gave me quite the scare!
Geralt|Not wise to play games with a witcher.
Cirilla|Whoreson Junior? Was there no one else you could impersonate?
Cyprian Willey|Once we'd fled, I had no idea what to do. I could only hide for so long, they'd find me sooner or later.
Cyprian Willey|It wasn't a hard decision. We knew he was dead, but not many others had caught on. That was me chance.
Cirilla|That was courageous, Dudu. I'd never expect it from you.
Cyprian Willey|Neither would I.
Cyprian Willey|Oh, by the way - you've no idea at the relief I feel you're alive and well.
Cirilla|And I'm relieved I didn't slit your throat.
Geralt|Chose an interesting line of business.
Cirilla|Dudu's always had a head for numbers. What's a few brothels and casinos? He'll manage.
Cyprian Willey|That's the thing - I don't need to.
Cyprian Willey|Two weeks after Wily died I announced that I'd seen the light of the Eternal Fire.
Cyprian Willey|Sold all the illegal enterprises. I'm a blue water trader now.
Geralt|Whoreson's men didn't protest?
Cyprian Willey|I've contacts in the guilds, run a thriving trade, profits are twice what they were before.
Cyprian Willey|To Wily's men, a purse twice as heavy means twice as much respect for the man handin' it to them.
Geralt|Be careful. You could get found out.
Cyprian Willey|Wily's men're too stupid to catch on. His colleagues ain't much better.
Cyprian Willey|Mind you, even you were fooled.
Cirilla|And that might've ended very badly for you.
Cyprian Willey|True, I… get a bit carried away at times. But mostly I'm careful.
Geralt|Time's up.
Cirilla|Right, we must still go by the Golden Sturgeon.
Cyprian Willey|It was nice to see you both. And take care of yourselves.
Cirilla|You too.
Geralt|So long, Dudu.
Geralt|Wouldn't have had to if you hadn't impersonated Whoreson.
Cirilla|What the blazes were you thinking?
Geralt|He's lying, end it.
Cyprian Willey|No, wait, I tell you true!
Cirilla|Prove it.
Cyprian Willey|Remember… remember when we went to steal Dijkstra's treasure?
Cyprian Willey|We released pops spores, made the troll drowsy. He sang in his sleep about Dijkstra's foot wrappings and asked for elf soup!

Novigrad Thug Strong 01|What?
Geralt|Here to see Mr. Wily.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Mr. Wily's expectin' important guests, so bugger off, you, you…
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Turds!
Geralt|Make a deal, maybe…?
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Eeer... yeah, yeah, a deal.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Go on upstairs. Boss is waitin'.
Geralt|Here I thought we could do this the nice way…
Cirilla|Outta the way, you louts, or we'll cut up your mugs so the girls at Crippled Kate's won't even have you.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|What'd you say?
Cirilla|Didn't understand? Too many syllables? Fuck off.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Oh, you little bitch!
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|You say "Geralt"? Geralt who?
Geralt|Of fucking Rivia.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|We-e-ell, why didn't you say that from the get-go?
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Sorry to hassle yous - misunderstandin', that.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Mr. Wily's expectin' you.
<|endoftext|>
Cyprian Willey|Who… who's there?
Cirilla|Remember me?
Cyprian Willey|You… you cunt. You little arse-fucked whore! You… you'll pay for what you did to me!
Geralt|I'd watch your words if I were you.
Cyprian Willey|Wi-i-i-tche-e-r! It's all your fault! Happy, you cocksucker?!
Cyprian Willey|I've naught left! Not a bloody scrap… of human dignity left!
Cyprian Willey|Ow!
Cyprian Willey|You little shit!
Cirilla|On the way here, I didn't know what I'd do. Killing him was definitely an option.
Geralt|Still want to?
Cirilla|No. This is worse.
Geralt|Let's go.
Cirilla|We've done the hardest part. Only the pleasant bits left now.
Geralt|Where're we going?
Cirilla|The Golden Sturgeon. A girl who works there helped me.
Cirilla|Not what I thought I'd find…
Geralt|Wonder what happened to him.
Cirilla|We'll soon find out.
Geralt|So there is justice in this world.
Cirilla|Come, let's see…
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Gave you a chance. Shoulda taken it.
Novigrad Female Bard 01|I spit on anything you give me.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|You'll regret that, you cow.
Geralt|Mind your manners, you're talking to a lady.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Stay out of this - this is not your concern.
Geralt|Sure it is.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|You're a fuckin' freak, too.
Cirilla|He is. Very dangerous at that. The Butcher of White Orchard.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|What'd he do there? Trim the trees?
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Yugen, he slew half the village, dragged the bodies of the ealdorman and his wife behind his horse to Novigrad. Let's get out of here.
Geralt|That's pretty good advice your friend's offering.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|S-s-sorry.
Geralt|Draw your weapons. Let's get this over with.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Whoa… what?
Geralt|You're out to hurt her, I won't let you, so we'll argue and swagger and have who knows how long a pissing contest.
Geralt|I don't have time for that. Draw your swords.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Female Bard 01|Thank you. They seemed more determined this time.
Cirilla|Shouldn't cross them, I told you.
Novigrad Female Bard 01|I'm to bar nonhumans from this establishment because some thugs threaten me? Not likely!
Cirilla|So good to see you, Bea.
Novigrad Female Bard 01|And you, Ciri. Who's your charming companion?
Geralt|Geralt of Rivia.
Novigrad Female Bard 01|THAT Geralt?
Novigrad Female Bard 01|Mh-- Very nice to meet you. I've heard so much.
Geralt|Really? What, for example?
Novigrad Female Bard 01|For example, how you've saved her from woe so many times she's lost count. And how you always know how to make her laugh.
Novigrad Female Bard 01|That's Ciri, of course. Other ladies, however…
Cirilla|Bea, I'm standing right here.
Novigrad Female Bard 01|All right, all right.
Novigrad Female Bard 01|So, what brings you here, darlings?
Cirilla|I wanted to thank you. For everything.
Novigrad Female Bard 01|Oh, stop! Anyone would've done the same in my shoes!
Cirilla|Not many would have done it with such courage. Thank you.
Cirilla|This is for you. A trinket, to remember me by.
Novigrad Female Bard 01|Oh my, it's beautiful! Thank you. So? Will you stay for stew? Innkeep slaughtered a piglet this morning.
Cirilla|Thanks, but we must still visit Farcorners.
Novigrad Female Bard 01|Ahh, off to see Valdo, eh? Well, shan't stop you, then. They'll feed you properly there too, no doubt.
Novigrad Female Bard 01|Farewell to you both. And do take care of her, witcher.
Geralt|I will. So long.
Geralt|Ciri, didn't you have something to take care of?
Cirilla|Right.
Geralt|A defender of the downtrodden.
Novigrad Female Bard 01|Mmm… Just so happens I was just trodden upon head to toe. Perhaps you'd be kind enough to help me recover?
Cirilla|Bea, you strumpet, control yourself! This is Geralt!
Novigrad Female Bard 01|Ah. Aha! Why didn't you say so to start with?
Geralt|Nobody important.
Novigrad Female Bard 01|I'd gladly put you up for the night. Could use a "nobody" like you…
<|endoftext|>
Elf Man 02|What brings you here?
Cirilla|I've come to apologize. I disappeared so suddenly then…
Elf Man 02|Pish-posh! What matters is you're back, and you're well.
Cirilla|This is for you. All that you loaned me plus a small premium.
Elf Man 02|Ciri… You know I can't take this…
Cirilla|And you know I shan't let you refuse.
Elf Man 02|Hmm… I know! We'll make it the pot for a wager! Do you still race?
Cirilla|Of course.
Elf Man 02|Then I challenge you! Geralt, will you join us?
Geralt|Gladly.
Elf Man 02|A man after my own spirit! Come!
Cirilla|Geralt! Choose one of these!
Geralt|Coming, coming…
Geralt|No, thanks. Not up to it today.
Elf Man 02|For every ache of body and soul, there's no better remedy than Kaedweni golden, isn't that right, Ciri?
Cirilla|As rain.
Elf Man 02|Stay with us! Bonfires to be lit soon round which all will gather! This night shall be ours!
Elf Man 02|Ciri! You devil incarnate! Where've you been?!
Elf Man 03|Come here, darling! Hallo - what's this? Brought your granddad?
Cirilla|Aegar, you're incorrigible.
Cirilla|Allow me to introduce Geralt of Rivia.
Elf Man 02|Ahh, greetings! We've heard heaps about you!
Geralt|Mostly lies, I bet.
Elf Man 02|If it's a lie that since her youngest years you've been her friend and mentor, then indeed - she is a bold-faced liar!
Elf Man 02|Weeelll, good you're here. Come in the nick of time! We'd have been gone by tomorrow.
Cirilla|You're leaving?
Elf Man 03|Provided we can find the animals to carry us. Two of our horses dropped on the way, another two are too weak to haul anything.
Elf Man 02|We'll manage somehow! We don't leave till tomorrow, so naught to worry about today!
Elf Man 03|Yes… For some. I'm off to see a merchant. There's a chance I can trade our nags for a healthy horse.
Elf Man 03|Wouldn't want Valdo to have anything to worry about tomorrow…
Geralt|What's eating him?
Elf Man 02|Oh, don't worry. That's just how Aegar is. Be back to his jolly old self by evening.
Geralt|Hm… Any way we can help?
Elf Man 02|Oh, don't you fret about us. We always get by somehow, right, Ciri?
Elf Man 03|They're to start resettling nonhumans shortly. We'd rather stay ahead of events.
Cirilla|I understand…
Elf Man 03|Problem is, we just lost two horses, and another two are too weak to haul anything.
Geralt|Likewise. And thanks for helping Ciri.
Elf Man 02|Oh, we had no choice! Found it hard to refuse a lass like her!
<|endoftext|>
Elf Man 02|On form and fast as ever!
Geralt|Good race.
Cirilla|Thanks. Truly swift, this mare.
Elf Man 02|The swiftest horse is worth no more than a mule without a good rider.
Elf Man 02|Well, this calls for a celebration! Stay the evening! We've several barrels of Kaedwen's best.
Elf Man 02|Bonfires to be lit soon round which all will gather! This night shall be ours!
Geralt|Can still beat you.
Cirilla|I let you win.
Elf Man 02|Lovely race!
Cirilla|Still swift as the wind, Valdo.
Geralt|Haven't raced anyone that good in a while.
Elf Man 02|Haha. You're worthy opponents, you gave me wings!
<|endoftext|>
Elf Man 02|You were faster once!
Cirilla|Giving you a head start!
Cirilla|Faster! You're trailing!
Geralt|Watch where you're going, or you'll fall!
Cirilla|Haha, seems you've slowed!
Elf Man 02|Just want to admire you from the side!
Elf Female 01|He was absolutely dreadful on stage.
Elf Female 01|But when he came to court me, he proved quite amusing.
Elf Female 01|This one time, for instance, he ate a wooden plate.
Elf Man 01|And? Did you yield?
Elf Female 01|Oh, don't scoff, it was touching!... In its own way…
Elf Female 01|But to bind myself to a dwarven clown - that's not for me.
Elf Female 02|Lovely mare.
Elf Man 02|Indeed, indeed.
Elf Man 01|Ehh, I suppose I must practice a bit…
Elf Female 01|Who would like more wine?
Elf Man 01|Yolo was a magician, an illusionist. He'd always perform in a mask.
Elf Man 01|His choice act - sawing women from the audience in half.
Elf Man 01|The women would lie down in a crate, then he'd saw through it, right down the middle.
Elf Man 01|He'd separate the two halves, then push them back together, and the ladies would stand up intact.
Elf Man 01|But once… one didn't.
Elf Female 02|What? Why?
Elf Man 01|That day someone else donned his mask, grabbed a woman from the crowd, laid her in the crate, and…
Elf Man 01|We learned later the man was her cuckold, and this was his revenge.
Elf Female 02|And Yolo? What happened to him?
Elf Man 01|We found him bound in one of the wagons. He was fine, but we could never perform in the town again.
Elf Man 01|Ha! Who's the best now?!
Elf Man 01|From here to the old willow!
Elf Man 03|Old Blue Eyes has a limp, and Marilyn's lost all her teeth.
Elf Man 03|We barely managed, even with them.
Elf Man 02|Hmm… We can't afford new horses.
Elf Man 03|Told you what we need to do.
Elf Man 02|And I told you we must find another way.
Elf Female 01|Hm… Is that everything?
Elf Man 01|Ugh, the road again tomorrow…
Elf Man 02|Forced out of Novigrad! What's the world coming to?
Elf Female 02|I'm glad we're leaving.
Elf Man 03|We must go before the guards come…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Hard to find good guards these days…
Cirilla|Quiet, you'll wake them.
Geralt|Wait here. I'll go inside, open the door for you.
Elf Man 03|Just keep the noise down.
Geralt|Quick, get in here.
Geralt|Oughta let Ciri and the others in.
Geralt|Gotta calm all the horses before they wake the guards.
Geralt|*Whistles*
Elf Man 03|Finally!
Geralt|Aegar, keep a lookout. Ciri and I'll try to get inside.
Elf Man 03|All right.
Geralt|Locked… gotta find another way in.
Cirilla|Calm the horses. Aegar and I will open the door.
Geralt|Hah. Here's the key.
Geralt|Damn. Bolted from the inside.
Novigrad Guard 02|What're you doin' here? Sod off, vagrant… Folk're trying' to get some rest, see?
Geralt|Gotta find another way in.
<|endoftext|>
Elf Female 01|More wine?
Geralt|Thanks.
Cirilla|I'm glad we stayed.
Geralt|Me too.
Geralt|They like you here.
Cirilla|I like them, too. Ahh, I'd love to join them…
Cirilla|Drink and race, travel from town to town. Not worry a whit about anything…
Geralt|Good plan. Think I'll go with you.
Cirilla|Then our future's settled.
Cirilla|If, that is, there's more than ash left of us once this is over.
Geralt|Defeating the Hunt won't be easy, but with the Lodge's support, Avallac'h's… We can do this.
Cirilla|I fear fighting the Hunt will only be the beginning. For me, at least.
Geralt|What do you mean?
Elf Female 01|Hahaha!
Elf Man 01|You promised!
Elf Female 01|In jest!
Cirilla|Sometimes I wish I could be like them.
Geralt|Drunk or giggly? Whichever it is, today's your chance.
Cirilla|Haha, not what I meant.
Cirilla|I'd like to be ordinary.
Geralt|Problem is, you're not. You were born to greatness.
Cirilla|As I've been hearing since I was born.
Cirilla|All because of this damned Elder Blood! My gift - my curse.
Cirilla|It granted me all of these powers, but it's also why I've spent my life fleeing, hiding.
Geralt|Then it's time to end this. Once we defeat Eredin, you'll be free.
Cirilla|Really? Eredin's hardly alone. There are others, they have plans for me.
Cirilla|It was the sorceresses of the Lodge once, now it's my father, even Yennefer…
Geralt|You're forgetting Avallac'h…
Cirilla|Avallac'h's different…
Cirilla|He is intent on my gift not falling into the wrong hands, not spinning out of control. It's why he teaches me, protects me.
Geralt|If you say so…
Cirilla|You doubt it?
Geralt|There'll come a day when Avallac'h will ask you for a favor.
Cirilla|Perhaps… But if so, it will be a very, very long time from now…
Cirilla|And I'm certain whatever it is, he'll give me a choice. I will have the option to refuse.
Geralt|Hope you're right…
Cirilla|That's Pablo. I plan to learn how to juggle one day.
Geralt|Incredibly useful skill.
Elf Man 03|Finally found you two! Enjoying yourselves?
Geralt|Bonfires, wine, jugglers… What more could you ask for?
Elf Man 03|I can name a few things I'd trade it for, but it's a life…
Cirilla|You seem concerned. Things not go well with the merchant?
Elf Man 03|Bah, lost cause. The man refused to trade, I said I'd buy, he asked three arms and a host of legs for one healthy animal.
Elf Man 03|We need horses. But we'll have to find another way to get them…
Cirilla|Ho-ho, I sense trouble…
Elf Man 03|I knew you'd warm to the notion.
Elf Man 03|We mean to sneak into the man's stable. With thirty head, a few more or less won't make a difference in his life.
Elf Man 03|Coming with?
Cirilla|Of course!
Geralt|Ehh, what can I do? Gotta help those in need…
Cirilla|Yes, yes, yes!
Elf Man 03|Must say, you didn't seem the type to me…
Geralt|What type?
Elf Man 03|Steady. Time to go! We'll meet by the stables.
Geralt|None of this concerns us.
Cirilla|This does concern me. These are my friends.
Geralt|They'll manage on their own.
Elf Man 03|If Ciri wishes to ride with us, she should. She's not your property.
Geralt|I won't let her risk her neck for thieves.
Geralt|Just buy the horses. Why can't you?
Elf Man 03|With what coin?
Geralt|Ciri gave you a full pouch…
Elf Man 03|Enough for one at most. Whereas at the least we need four.
Cirilla|Geralt, stop fussing. We'll not strip the merchant bare, and it's finally a chance to do something other than run from the Wild Hunt!
Cirilla|Don't make us beg!
Geralt|Gotta be another way to solve this…
Geralt|Just so happens I got some coin I could lend you.
Elf Man 03|We'd have no way to repay you.
Geralt|Wouldn't have to.
Elf Man 03|A generous offer, but not one to resolve this situation.
Elf Man 03|The merchant didn't object to our coin, he objected to us. "I'll not trade with such scum" - believe those were his words.
Elf Man 03|And if he'll not trade, we've no choice but to steal from him.
Geralt|I dunno. Doesn't seem like the best idea…
Cirilla|Shame the emperor doesn't have another daughter. We could buy all the horses in Novigrad.
Geralt|We were. Until someone interrupted us.
Elf Man 03|Rather prickly, this friend of yours.
Cirilla|You've much in common.
Cirilla|How did you fare with the merchant?
Geralt|I'd rather know how you fared with the merchant. Manage to get some horses?
Geralt|The sooner you get rid of that illusion, the better.
Cirilla|What do you mean?
Geralt|Can always renounce a gift, turn it down…
Cirilla|It's not that easy. I tried once, remember?
Cirilla|Besides, even if doing that were to free me of Eredin, there will always be those with some kind of plan that includes me.
Geralt|Your life is yours, exclusively. You choose who you are.
Cirilla|Geralt, you know that's never been true.
Geralt|Meaning?
Cirilla|Ordinary.
Geralt|Me too. Being a witcher's a burden sometimes…
Cirilla|As is my "inheritance." I'd so like to be ordinary.
Geralt|Don't worry about that yet. One thing at a time.
Geralt|You do know you can always count on me, whatever happens?
Cirilla|I do. Thank you, Geralt.
Geralt|You worry too much. What will be, will be.
Geralt|Something worrying you now?
Cirilla|Ahh… What awaits us.
Geralt|Hmm… Fairytale life… but we gotta defeat the Wild Hunt first.
Cirilla|Worked out nicely, don't you think?
Geralt|What're you talking about?
Cirilla|You and Triss. Never expected it, to be honest.
Geralt|Life's full of surprises.
Cirilla|So, how did the two of you--?
Geralt|End up together?
Geralt|Hmm. With Yen it was fight after fight, lots of arguments, drama… Not saying it was bad, but…
Cirilla|But what?
Geralt|Got to be exhausting. With Triss, it's not. I finally feel…  harmony. A calm. Feel like things are the way they're supposed to be.
Cirilla|You know… perhaps it's not my concern, but… I'm glad you and Yennefer have ended up together.
Geralt|Me too.
Cirilla|You took your time.
Geralt|Hm. Guess we both needed a while to grapple with it.
Cirilla|So what was it like? You know, when the wish lost its hold. What did you feel?
Geralt|Hmm. Well, there we were, the two of us, on the mountain top. I looked at her, and…
Geralt|And felt like I was exactly where I was supposed to be. At long last.
<|endoftext|>
Elf Man 03|Whooo-hooo! We did it!
Cirilla|Excellent work! Did you see the two fools who tried to chase us?
Elf Man 03|Almost tripped over their own boots!
Cirilla|Thanks, Geralt, that was splendid!
Geralt|Yeah… A nice change from killing monsters.
Elf Man 03|Thanks for your help. And for visiting.
Cirilla|It was so good to see you all again. Hang in there and take care of yourselves.
Elf Man 03|Don't forget us. So long.
Cirilla|I must bid Valdo farewell.
Geralt|All right. See you at Dandelion's, then. Got some things to take care of in town.
Cirilla|See you, Geralt.
Geralt|Glad to see you happy… But I don't think what we did was right.
Elf Man 03|How can you keep the company of such a bore?
Cirilla|Leave him alone, Aegar. That's just how Geralt is - righteous.
<|endoftext|>
Elf Man 03|Had a falling out… with Ciri's companion.
Elf Man 02|Ciri… Much as I hate to say it, I think it's time the two of you left.
Cirilla|I know, the magic's gone. Sorry.
Cirilla|I'm going down to the riverside. Want to take a walk, be alone for a bit.
Geralt|Sorry for that.
Cirilla|You've no need to apologize for acting according to your nature.
Cirilla|I'll meet you back at Dandelion's.
Geralt|I understand. Let's meet at Dandelion's.
Geralt|Should've made that clear to your friend!
Elf Man 02|What is this? Have you gone mad?!
Elf Man 02|We were to revel, not punch each other to a pulp!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Buy you a drink?
Yennefer|I'm afraid the dishwater's as good as it gets in this establishment.
Yennefer|Imlerith - was that your idea or Ciri's?
Geralt|Mine.
Yennefer|Lying didn't always come so easily to you.
Geralt|If you intend to--
Yennefer|I was about to say... it's nice that you protect her. And you did the right thing to go with her.
Geralt|I thought you'd be angry.
Yennefer|Angry? Why? Because you supported Ciri in her decision? Or because you fought by her side and won?
Geralt|What if we'd lost?
Yennefer|We wouldn't be having this conversation. And the female part of the Continent's population would be drowning in tears.
Yennefer|You won. No point bothering with "what ifs."
Geralt|What do you know about this fugitive?
Yennefer|I know he's the only one ever to escape from Deireadh. Every guardsman in the city now seeks him.
Geralt|Sure he can be trusted?
Yennefer|We'll soon find out. He just walked in.
Geralt|Hm. Charming place. Why're you here?
Yennefer|I was able to establish Margarita's whereabouts - the prison in Oxenfurt.
Yennefer|I also learned the identity of a man who escaped from there. He should arrive shortly.
Yennefer|You'll find out soon. In the meantime, tell me about Philippa.
Geralt|Nothing to tell yet. Came to get you first.
Geralt|So, gonna tell me why you're here?
Geralt|Triss and I found her and freed her. It turned out Dijkstra had her. But the situation's under control.
Yennefer|That's a relief.
Geralt|How'd it go with the Lodge? Anyone agree to help?
Yennefer|I'm afraid the situation looks grim.
Yennefer|But it's neither the time nor place for this discussion. Triss will tell you more.
Geralt|Talked to Triss. Reconvening the Lodge - it's not going so well…
Yennefer|And I can't blame them.
Geralt|Ciri's.
Yennefer|As I thought. I'm glad you went with her.
Geralt|Spare me your lecture about responsibility.
Yennefer|I was actually going to recite an anthem praising your glory, but if you're not in the mood…
Yennefer|Dangerous times, especially for sorceresses. Each thinks five times before sticking her neck out.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Locked tight, won't budge. Gotta be a lever around here somewhere…
Geralt|Wall looks brittle…
Novigrad Old Man 03|Help!
Yennefer|Stop screaming, or I'll harm you.
Witch Hunter 01|Alarm! Intruders!
Witch Hunter 01|Argh!
Witch Hunter 03|For the Eternal Fire!
Witch Hunter 04|Who are you?
Witch Hunter 04|How'd you get in here?
Witch Hunter 04|Intruuuderrrr!
Yennefer|Run, he's getting away!
Geralt|Dammit, scaled the ladder. Guess I'm in for a roof walk…
Witch Hunter 01|What's this?! Drinkin' on duty?!
Witch Hunter 02|Whosh to shay I can't?
Sheala|Curse you, witcher.
Witch Hunter 02|Alaarrm!
Zoltan Chivay|Psst! Geralt! Over here!
Geralt|Guards're drunk… Could get louder than sober men if they notice me.
Yennefer|Geralt!
Geralt|Hm... Mechanism's broken, missing a piece. Replace it with something else, maybe?
Geralt|That oughta do it.
Geralt|This'll come in handy.
Yennefer|Catch him!
Geralt|Sure the guards don't know about the passage through the ruins, haven't planted sentries there?
Yennefer|They haven't.
Geralt|How can you be sure?
Yennefer|Novigrad's hierarchs have taken great care to eradicate any and all memories of the city's elven roots.
Yennefer|Even if anyone remembers the ruins are there, they have no recollection of how far and where they extend. And I'm absolutely certain no one's thought to place sentries there.
Geralt|Hope you're right.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Thought you'd agreed to meet.
Yennefer|I said I'd found him, not that I'd spoken to him.
Novigrad Old Man 03|What do you want from me?! Let me be!
Geralt|Calm down. We just wanna chat.
Novigrad Old Man 03|Uh-huh, and then stick a shiv between my ribs, leave me in the gutter.
Yennefer|Look at us. Do we look like bandits to you?
Novigrad Old Man 03|Hm… No… Not really.
Yennefer|I'm glad you agree. Besides, you'd be worthless to us dead.
Novigrad Old Man 03|So… you shan't hurt me?
Geralt|No. You're gonna tell us your story, then be on your way.
Novigrad Old Man 03|Hm… oh, so be it. But we, uh, really ought to go back to Kate's. It's unwise to linger in the street.
Yennefer|Take off the kid gloves, Geralt.
Novigrad Old Man 03|Hm… No… Not really.
<|endoftext|>
Yennefer|Drink up, it'll help.
Novigrad Old Man 03|Thanks… What do you want?
Yennefer|To get into Deireadh.
Novigrad Old Man 03|Find a hunter, tell him you practice magic. They'll lock you up lickety-split.
Geralt|We need to get in without anyone noticing. Tell us how you escaped, then get on with your life.
Geralt|See? Wasn't so hard.
Yennefer|One last bit of advice - find a new tavern. Everyone here knows you.
Novigrad Old Man 03|Thank you. Whatever your plans, I hope they work out.
Geralt|So do we. So long.
Geralt|What now?
Yennefer|What our friend said about the guards was interesting…
Geralt|Drinking on duty? Zoltan could make sure they have plenty of hooch.
Yennefer|Good idea. I'll search for the entrance to the ruins.
Yennefer|Let's meet on the Oxenfurt Bridge.
Geralt|What he said about the guards - could prove handy.
Yennefer|True. Things will go more smoothly if we can get even a few of them drunk.
Geralt|Zoltan oughta manage it. I'll ask him.
Geralt|So theoretically we could get in the way you got out.
Yennefer|Assuming we don't mind the company of decomposing corpses.
Novigrad Old Man 03|And assuming you can squeeze through the grate. They barred the outlet to the river after I escaped.
Geralt|Huh. Explosives could take care of that.
Yennefer|For half the city to hear us? I've a better plan. Oxenfurt was built on elven ruins…
Geralt|Which have to connect to the sewers somewhere. If we can find a way into the ruins…
Yennefer|We'll get into the prison.
Geralt|They say no one gets outta Deireadh alive…
Novigrad Old Man 03|Aye, so they say… My thought - why not try it dead?
Yennefer|But they burn the corpses.
Novigrad Old Man 03|They didn't start burning them until they learned an old fellow like myself had escaped. Before, they'd drop the stiffs into a great pit.
Novigrad Old Man 03|The pit's connected to the sewers, and the sewers empty into the river. And once you reach the river, you're as free as a fish.
Geralt|They say Deireadh's better guarded than the keep at Vicovaro.
Novigrad Old Man 03|They choose the guards from among witch hunters - the worst dregs, rabid fanatics! if you only knew what they do to folk…
Novigrad Old Man 03|Torture everyday - the wheel, the rack… We only knew peace on holidays, when they'd drink themselves blind.
Yennefer|They're allowed to drink on duty?
Novigrad Old Man 03|No-not officially but… you know how it is.
Geralt|So you played dead… No one caught on?
Novigrad Old Man 03|As a youth I'd apprenticed with an apothecary in Silverton. Learned a thing or two about herbs.
Novigrad Old Man 03|Sleeping mushrooms grew on the walls of my cell. And I found belladonna in the prison yard.
Novigrad Old Man 03|Just had to mash them together and eat the pulp an hour before evening rounds…
Yennefer|You might have lost your life.
Novigrad Old Man 03|I preferred to die on my own terms were that to be my fate.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|They're holding Margarita at Deireadh. Got a plan to break her out, but we need your help.
Zoltan Chivay|What should I do?
Geralt|Load a wagon with as much Mahakaman as you can find and drive it to Oxenfurt.
Geralt|Yennefer'll give the signal, you'll drive through the gates and treat the guards.
Zoltan Chivay|Ahh, understood, free hooch'll tempt any man. But Geralt… you realize this is a wee bit risky…?
Geralt|I do. It's why I'm here. Can only trust you to get this done.
Zoltan Chivay|Hmm… If that's how you want ot put it… All right, leave it to me, I'll think of somethin'. And where might you be headed?
Geralt|To meet Yen.
Geralt|She went to find a way into the ruins beneath the city.
Zoltan Chivay|Don't get caught… It'd be a cryin' shame to waste that much Mahakaman…
Zoltan Chivay|Ugh, these're terrible times… Since the mages left town, the hunters've taken to harrassin' nonhumans.
Zoltan Chivay|A dwarf lingerin' 'round the prison gates only stands to attract attention.
Geralt|Right, didn't think of that…
Geralt|I'll go straight to Yen, in that case.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Find a way in?
Yennefer|Several. Nearest is through a well not far from here.
Yennefer|Did you arrange any help?
Geralt|We'll manage on our own.
Yennefer|Shall we begin?
Geralt|Let's do this.
Geralt|Actually, maybe you're right. A little help can go a long way.
Yennefer|Of course I'm right.
Yennefer|Go. I'll wait here.
Geralt|Zoltan awaits your signal.
Geralt|Graden'll show up, and Zoltan awaits your signal.
Geralt|Need a bit more time.
Yennefer|Hurry.
Geralt|Not coming?
Yennefer|Mucking through ruins and sewers, hmmm, I'd rather leave it to the expert.
Geralt|Meaning you'd rather waltz in once the hard work's done.
Geralt|See you inside, then.
Yennefer|Good luck.
Geralt|It's never been this bad.
Yennefer|They failed to find a way to leave Novigrad, so they made a last, hopeless stand…
Yennefer|Here we are.
Geralt|This is it? Hmm… Boulder was plugging the well until recently.
Yennefer|Due to an edict Hemmelfart issued some years ago. But I managed to find two brawny and obliging passers-by who agreed to remove the impediment. For a modest fee, naturally.
Yennefer|Here.
Geralt|What is this?
Yennefer|Use it once you find Rita. I'll be able to pinpoint your location.
Yennefer|Come. It's a short way away.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Margarita!
Margarita Laux Antille|Who… Who's that?
Margarita Laux Antille|Geralt? Gods, I'm hallucinating…
Geralt|Getting you outta here.
Margarita Laux Antille|No chance. We'll both die in here.
Geralt|Síle?
Margarita Laux Antille|They captured her first. Her condition's critical.
Margarita Laux Antille|It's pointless… You'll never open it without the key…
Margarita Laux Antille|The warden keeps them with him at all times. His room is upstairs.
Geralt|Be right back.
Margarita Laux Antille|What are you doing?
Geralt|Yen insisted on coming.
Yennefer|Rita! Síle?!
Yennefer|When I get my hands on the sons of bitches…
Sheala|Yenna… I shan't make it…
Yennefer|Hold on, you must hold on.
Sheala|Aaaargh!
Sheala|I'm dying, Yenna. I'm a sorceress, let me die with dignity.
Geralt|Yen, get Rita out of here.
Yennefer|Geralt…
Sheala|Yenna, for once, don't argue with him…
Yennefer|I can't pass through the portal with you both. You'll need to get out on your own.
Geralt|Don't like portals anyway. Go.
Sheala|Funny… there was a time I'd have asked you not to do this…
Geralt|No, you'd never have asked… You're too proud.
Geralt|Yen, we should go. Nothing we can do to save her.
Yennefer|No. But we can help her die the way she wants to.
Geralt|I won't do it.
Yennefer|I will.
Yennefer|Come. We must hurry, or we'll lose Rita, too.
Yennefer|Rita!
Yennefer|What have they done… ? When I get my hands on those whoresons…
Margarita Laux Antille|I'll gladly help. If I live to see it.
Yennefer|I must take her from here. Immediately.
Margarita Laux Antille|What… What is this?
<|endoftext|>
Zoltan Chivay|Finally here. Your plan blew arsechunks.
Geralt|Why?
Zoltan Chivay|Soon as you started that butchery in the courtyard, they all wanted to run over there.
Zoltan Chivay|Had to hold 'em back… through conventional means.
Geralt|By yourself? All of them? Where are the bodies?
Zoltan Chivay|Hid 'em in the wagon. Runnin' a tavern with Dandelion's given me plenty of practice disposin' of corpses.
Zoltan Chivay|By-the-by, goin' back with me, or got aught to do along the way?
Geralt|Always up for a ride with you.
Zoltan Chivay|Let's hit the road, then!
Geralt|You clearly don't need an escort. I'll go on foot.
Zoltan Chivay|Heheh, fine. Meet ya there.
Geralt|Can't help being curious - how'd you get 'em drunk?
Zoltan Chivay|Ach, oldest trick in the book. Posed as a merchant conveyin' some wine. Soon as they eyed me, they decided an inspection was in order.
Zoltan Chivay|I started wailin', beggin' 'em to leave it. The best Redanian, I says, boss at the Passiflora'll have my balls. That settled it - they had to inspect it, each and every barrel…
Geralt|Good plan. And good work. Thanks, Zoltan.
Zoltan Chivay|Don't mention it. So, you goin' to Dandelion's with me, or alone?
Zoltan Chivay|There y'are. How'd you fare? Margarita with you?
Geralt|Yen's got her. Probably at Dandelion's already.
Zoltan Chivay|Grand work, there, both of you. Guards didn't even notice they had guests.
Zoltan Chivay|So, comin' with me to Dandelion's, or you gonna faff about along the way?
Zoltan Chivay|Here we are.
Geralt|Thanks again for your help, Zoltan.
Zoltan Chivay|Always willin', mate.

Witch Hunter 02|To arms!
Witch Hunter 02|Mages revolting!
Witch Hunter 03|Raise the barricades!
Witch Hunter 03|Archers on the roof! All others to their stations!
Geralt|Barred shut.
Geralt|Need to find another way out.
Witch Hunter 02|Where are the mages?
Witch Hunter 03|Don't be fooled!
Witch Hunter 03|Sent him ahead. They'll mount a full assault in a minute!
Novigrad Poor Man 11|Thank ye, thank ye, good sir…
Novigrad Traveler Man 04|Gods reward you!
Novigrad Poor Woman 11|Thank you… Be careful, now. Don't let 'em get you.
<|endoftext|>
Cirilla|Geralt!
Geralt|What is it?
Cirilla|Nothing just yet, but something's afoot. Philippa and Margarita want to speak to me.
Geralt|They say about what?
Cirilla|No, but I have my suspicions.
Cirilla|I bet they have plans for me. And they're deigning to inform me of them.
Geralt|Not a conversation you're likely to avoid. I'll go with you if you want.
Cirilla|Hmm… They'll weigh their words more carefully with you there.
Geralt|Wouldn't be so sure… But two heads're better than one.
Geralt|Let's get this over with.
Geralt|Got nothing to be afraid of. Just go, listen to what they have to say.
Cirilla|And if they try to force me into something?
Geralt|Can't believe you'd ever let them.
Geralt|Margarita's only ever cared about your education. Doubt she'll try to drag you into politics.
Geralt|Philippa's tougher. Plays a mean game, but ultimately respects those who hold to their views.
Geralt|If she makes you an offer, and you firmly turn it down, she'll respect that.
Cirilla|Thanks, Geralt.
Geralt|Well, go. Don't give 'em any more time to strategize.
Geralt|Then talk to them. Not like they're out to bite you.
Cirilla|If they do, I'll bite back.
Geralt|So what's the problem?
Geralt|Don't waste any time, do they. I don't like this.
Cirilla|Neither do I.
<|endoftext|>
Margarita Laux Antille|Sages invariably have hidden agendas. Altruism is simply not part of their constitution.
Margarita Laux Antille|You're a tool in his hands, even if you don't see it.
Philippa Eilhart|We will assure you knowledge and protection, but you shall be your own rudder, captain and ship.
Philippa Eilhart|And unlike Avallac'h, we can promise you this.
Margarita Laux Antille|We don't expect you to commit now. Think it over, what you've heard, what you feel. We will speak when you're ready.
Cirilla|If that is all, then…
Geralt|…Let's get some fresh air.
Geralt|…We need to go to Skellige, find the Sunstone.
Geralt|Avallac'h awaits down at the port.
Cirilla|You wished to speak.
Philippa Eilhart|To you. Not to Geralt.
Cirilla|Geralt stays or we both leave.
Margarita Laux Antille|Let him stay, Phil. He'd learn of it all anyways, eventually.
Philippa Eilhart|Ekhem. Fine then. So long as he does not interrupt.
Geralt|Think of me as part of the decor.
Philippa Eilhart|The Lodge once had great plans for you, important plans. Surely you remember.
Philippa Eilhart|You were to complete your studies and become one of us. Unfortunately, that did not come to pass.
Philippa Eilhart|We intend to revive the Lodge. And we renew our… offer - you must join us.
Cirilla|As before? I'm to marry some princeling and become your puppet?
Margarita Laux Antille|You were a child then, and we… misjudged the situation.
Margarita Laux Antille|This time we offer you a partnership.
Geralt|No equality in the Lodge. That's garbage. Some have always taken the reins, while others politely nodded.
Margarita Laux Antille|A wise and capable sorceress finds the role, the position that best suits her.
Philippa Eilhart|And yours should be supreme, you deserve to lead.
Philippa Eilhart|Realize, please, that you were made for great things. Work with us and you shall achieve them…
Philippa Eilhart|Just as soon as we teach you to control your power, channel--
Cirilla|I have Avallac'h for that…
Philippa Eilhart|You allow this? Do you truly believe his intentions are pure?
Geralt|I don't, but I'd rather deal with one Sage than the entire Lodge.
Geralt|Purer than yours, that's certain.
Geralt|I don't trust him, I don't trust you, but that doesn't matter. Ciri decides.
Geralt|The Lodge of Sorceresses has been outlawed throughout the Continent.
Geralt|Joining them means facing persecution, always being on the run.
Philippa Eilhart|Kings die, realms fall, but magic endures.
Philippa Eilhart|We are saddened our dear Síle will not join in this endeavor, but the circumstances preclude any prolonged mourning.
Philippa Eilhart|What is your decision? Will you join us?
Philippa Eilhart|We are saddened our dear Keira will not join in this endeavor, but the circumstances preclude any prolonged mourning.
Philippa Eilhart|We are saddened our dear sisters, Keira and Síle, will not join in this endeavor, but the circumstances preclude any prolonged mourning.
Geralt|I won't. Until Ciri decides otherwise.
<|endoftext|>
Yennefer|Not going with her?
Geralt|Can't hold her hand if they're gonna take her seriously.
Yennefer|True. Good decision.
Geralt|Relax, she'll be fine.
Yennefer|Rita won't hurt her, but Philippa… She can be ruthless.
Geralt|Ciri's been in tougher situations and come out of them all right.
Yennefer|True, we managed to instill some principles, skills that have helped…
Geralt|Exactly, so there's nothing to be afraid of.
Yennefer|Of course.
Yennefer|I'll just have a peek.
Geralt|Don't spy on her. You really have that little faith?
Yennefer|I don't trust Philippa and Rita.
Geralt|So why'd you even allow this meeting to happen?
Yennefer|For the same reason you did: if they're to respect her, she can't be seen to be hanging on to my apron strings.
Geralt|What do you see?
Yennefer|Philippa pontificating. Ciri pacing wall to wall.
Yennefer|She's stopped.
Yennefer|She's saying something.
Yennefer|Philippa's turned pale!
Geralt|What now?
Yennefer|Quiet! Here she comes.
Yennefer|So?
Cirilla|You were eavesdropping.
Geralt|Yes.
Yennefer|No.
Cirilla|You haven't changed a bit.
Geralt|Tell us what you talked about?
Cirilla|I'd rather not. Not yet, at least.
Yennefer|Of course, when you're ready.
Cirilla|I must unwind. I'll go for a walk.
Yennefer|Foot in mouth, as usual.
Geralt|What're you talking about?
Yennefer|Nothing.
Geralt|Just wanted to…
Yennefer|Go meet Avallac'h. He wished to see you, apparently.
Triss|What happened?
Yennefer|Our… beloved witcher was just demonstrating what we love most in him: his candidness.
Triss|Since it seems to be over, perhaps…
Yennefer|Yes, good idea.
Geralt|You two are acting strange…
Yennefer|Us? No…
Triss|Yen and I, well, we talked and concluded…
Yennefer|…That we've wasted much too much time fighting… over you.
Triss|Meanwhile, we'll probably soon face the Wild Hunt, most likely battle Eredin himself… And who knows what could happen.
Yennefer|So, we decided we must try to make the most of the time we have left. Together.
Geralt|Together? Go on…
Triss|We've always loved each other, you're in love with us…
Yennefer|There's no point in fighting it. We must enjoy what we have.
Triss|So we've prepared… something special.
Yennefer|Come by the Kingfisher this evening…
Triss|Bring wine. Lots of wine.
Yennefer|See you later, love.
Triss|I can't wait.
Geralt|This'll be interesting…
Geralt|I don't like this…
Yennefer|You soon will…
Geralt|Something's not right. What're you up to?
Triss|Don't be nervous.
Geralt|I could use a little rest myself…
Yennefer|Good idea. Get some sleep.
Geralt|Take a walk, get some air… We need to sail to Skellige. Avallach's waiting at the port.
Cirilla|Of course. I'll be there soon.
Geralt|If you wanna be alone for a while, to digest, process…
Cirilla|Yes. I shall go for a walk. I must unwind.
Geralt|I hope she's…
Yennefer|She'll be fine. She's tougher than we think.
Yennefer|You ought to visit Avallac'h. He wished to see you, apparently.
Triss|How'd it go?
Yennefer|No casualties, so not bad, I suppose.
Triss|Ciri can handle herself… Gets it from you…
Geralt|Remember, we need to go to Skellige. Avallac'h awaits at the port.
Cirilla|I remember. I'll be there soon.
Geralt|That's my Ciri. Probably gave her an earful.
Geralt|Lemme have a look.
Yennefer|In your dreams.
Geralt|Knew you couldn't resist…
Yennefer|Pots and kettles, Geralt. You were dying to do the same, I saw you.
Geralt|You're the one with your face to the door.
Yennefer|Mhm, which is why I can see what's happening.
Geralt|Finally. Thought you wouldn't do it, didn't have the gall.
Geralt|Calm down. You'll wear a hole in the floor.
Yennefer|I'll calm down once she comes out.
Yennefer|So?
Cirilla|I don't know… Don't really want to talk about it… I'm going for a walk.
Yennefer|Geralt… Geralt, wake up.
Geralt|Wh…what? Yen? Something wrong?
Triss|Wake up. Sit with us a while.
Geralt|Triss? You here too? What's, uh, going on?
Triss|We need to tell you something.
<|endoftext|>
Dandelion|Haha. Well, well. Ladies did quite a number on you.
Geralt|Save it. I'm not in the mood...
Dandelion|Well, I sure am. What'd you play?
Dandelion|"Tame the fiend?" Or was it "Free the prince?"
Geralt|Dandelionnnn…
Dandelion|All right, all right. Sorry, don't often see you like this, couldn't resist…
Dandelion|So, how do you feel? A bit numb, I bet.
Geralt|Triss and Yen - where are they? Got something to say to them…
Dandelion|Oh, Geralt, how little you know about women… Did you really think you could have them both?
Dandelion|You have a great deal to learn… Glad to give you some advice if you want.
Geralt|Think I'll pass.
Geralt|I'm off to see Avallac'h. Wanted a word, apparently…
Geralt|I'm going to the port. We should already be on our way to Skellige.
Dandelion|Well, take care of yourself, friend. And you're not sore about my teasing, are you?
Geralt|No, I'm not. So long, Dandelion.
Geralt|Got what I deserved… Should've known it was too good to be true…
Dandelion|You certainly should have.
Geralt|Tell anyone about this and…
Dandelion|Calm down, won't peep a word. It's one thing to laugh at a friend, another thing entirely to make a laughing stock of him.
Geralt|You know about this?
Dandelion|No, they didn't tell me till this morning.
Dandelion|A shame, really, because it looks like you had a roaring good time.
Geralt|Do a number on you if you don't…
Dandelion|In your shoes, my friend, I'd be promising mounds of gold, not making threats.
Geralt|Untie me now, or you'll need that gold to replace your teeth.
Dandelion|Haha. You'd have to catch me first. And you don't exactly look like you're getting out of here anytime soon.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Heheh. Tomb raider. Seems this one liked elven stuff…
Geralt|Wet clothes… Oh joy…
Geralt|Damn, lots of pops in the air.
Geralt|Need a dose of the antidote.
Geralt|Gotta be kidding me…
Geralt|Hmm… Maybe oughta let her unwind?
Geralt|Damn. Forgot the wine.
Geralt|Hmm… Try a merchant nearby…?
Yennefer|This is it.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Meet you there. Gotta see to something along the way.
Avallach|Hurry. I'd rather not loiter in the street any longer than necessary.
Geralt|Need a hanky? Gotta admit, never expected this of you…
Avallach|You humans have… hm, unusual tastes.
Avallach|How did you fare on Bald Mountain?
Geralt|Need to ask? You're a Sage.
Avallach|I ask as a courtesy. A concept you clearly forgot when you left without uttering a word.
Geralt|Ciri was in a hurry.
Avallach|I know, so she wrote in her letter. But that is not my concern. You eliminated Imlerith adeptly. So adeptly you might say you inspired me…
Geralt|Meaning?
Avallach|The loss of one of his great generals has weakened Eredin. Significantly. Two others remain.
Geralt|How do we get rid of them?
Avallach|Caranthir is a loyalist, but Ge'els - that is another story.
Avallach|He was a devoted follower of our former king…
Avallach|And as it happens, Eredin poisoned our beloved ruler.
Geralt|Regicide - serious stuff… Take it not many know about this?
Avallach|Of the living - only I. And Eredin, of course.
Geralt|Question is, can you get Ge'els to believe you?
Avallach|Nothing you need worry about.
Geralt|Fine, so what do you propose?
Avallach|Why, to bring Ge'els here, show him the truth of what happened.
Geralt|Fabulous plan - if we only knew where to find him.
Avallach|We do. In the land of the Aen Elle.
Geralt|Think you're forgetting something - you and Ciri might know how to travel between worlds. But me, not so much.
Avallach|You clearly know there are many other worlds apart from the one where we now stand.
Avallach|They're linked by passages, hidden gateways that afford travel from one world to another.
Avallach|Of course, few know of these gateways, even fewer can locate them.
Geralt|Elven Sages, for example?
Avallach|For example. One such passage will open soon, near where we are, fortuitously enough. Between this noble edifice and the Butchers' Yard.
Avallach|That's our chance. Shall we go?
Geralt|Let's go.
Geralt|Land of the Aen Elle?
Avallach|You don't recall? After all, you did travel with Eredin for some time.
Avallach|The land of the Alder Folk. The world where we arrived centuries ago, a world that is now our home.
Avallach|The Red Riders come from there. And it is there where we will find Ge'els.
Geralt|Wanna deal, talk to him, trust him? I'd rather just kill him.
Avallach|That is precisely one of the reasons why Ge'els abhors your world. Your senseless brutality.
Avallach|At times one must use reason, rather than blades.
Geralt|How can you be sure Ge'els'll believe you?
Geralt|Haven't mentioned killing Ge'els…
Avallach|Such drastic means are not always necessary.
Geralt|So, you probably plan to offer him a deal.
Avallach|Brilliant deduction, bravo.
Geralt|You make it sound important. So, guess it's not exactly common knowledge…
Avallach|I'd even call it a secret.
Geralt|How'd he manage to hide it?
Avallach|Oh, I assure you, he's excellent at covering his tracks - though not terribly subtle.
Avallach|But I'm even better at uncovering them.
Geralt|How do you know? Or are you bluffing?
Avallach|Eredin made sure very few individuals knew of his betrayal. Most are now dead.
Geralt|Didn't answer my question.
Avallach|"How" matters not. What matters is I know - and I've an idea how to use this knowledge.
Geralt|Skip the guessing games, I'm tired.

Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|And who might you be?!

Novigrad Peasant 03|I don't know them.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|Likely!
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|Get the hell outta my house!
Geralt|Was just on my way out.
Godling Sara|Corinne, look who's come.
Geralt|Huh, live here together now? Didn't know.
Dreamer Corine Tilly|Once you told me Sarah'd been responsible for my nightmares, I decided to see if the devil's as scary as they paint him… or her.
Dreamer Corine Tilly|I came in to find not a fiend, but our little Sarah. And… I can't say why, but we took a liking to one another immediately.
Dreamer Corine Tilly|Go with Avallac'h, we'll talk later.
Avallach|We must hurry. The portal will open soon.
Dreamer Corine Tilly|Of course.
Avallach|We shall return soon with your patient.
Dreamer Corine Tilly|I shall be waiting.
Avallach|This way, Geralt.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What then? What'll we do with Ge'els?
Geralt|Plan to talk to him and that's that?
Avallach|Words alone won't convince him. But I think Miss Tilly's oneiromancy might.
Avallach|We're close.
Avallach|Ready to travel to another world?
Geralt|Found the passage?
Avallach|Yes, step over here.
Geralt|I know this house.
Geralt|Met a godling pretending to be a ghost here. Drove her out.
Geralt|Supposed to drive a godling from here.
Avallach|Supposed to?
Geralt|Decided it was harmless.
Avallach|Hmm, then we might run into it. Along with the person who's agreed to help us.
<|endoftext|>
Avallach|Once we enter, there'll be no returning until we reach Ge'els. Ready?
Geralt|Yes, let's go.
Avallach|Remember, wherever you land, search for a place that looks like this one. We shall meet, sooner or later.
Geralt|Mean we'll be separated?
Avallach|It's possible. I lack your ward's talent. Zireael is the Lady of Time and Space, I merely know how to use this arcane knowledge to a limited degree.
Avallach|It's time.
Geralt|I hate portals.
Geralt|A portal, here?
Avallach|This passage has existed since the Conjunction of Spheres. It will continue to exist, opening periodically, long after you all die.
Avallach|Several centuries ago a temple dedicated to the moon stood here. Even earlier, there was a circle of monoliths. Now there is a city on this spot.
Avallach|You build upon the ruins of hallowed places, upon intersections of the Power. And then you forget why. The ancient magic of these sites persists regardless.
Avallach|Is that sufficient, does it satisfy your curiosity? Ready now?
Geralt|Wait for me a minute.
Avallach|I remind you we have a job to do. Hurry.
Avallach|This is the place.
Avallach|The passage is here, past this wall.
Geralt|There it is.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Where are we?
Avallach|Welcome to the Ddiddiwedht Desert.
Geralt|This somewhere in our world?
Avallach|Ever seen such canyons in your world?
Avallach|Come, we must go.
Avallach|Ah, the portal.
Geralt|Looks more like a ruin.
Avallach|Appearances can be deceiving.
Geralt|So what're we waiting for?
Avallach|For it to open. Shouldn't take but a few moments.
Geralt|What's going on?
Avallach|The sandcrabs have sensed our presence.
Geralt|Wonderful.
Geralt|What is this place?
Avallach|A very old world, thoroughly raped and destroyed.
Geralt|Anything live here?
Avallach|Mainly desert creatures able to survive months on end without water.
Avallach|Oh, and large sandcrabs, beneath the surface.
Avallach|We must be careful they don't sense us.
Geralt|And before? Were there any… people? Or elves?
Avallach|Do you believe humanoids have a monopoly on destroying worlds?
Geralt|So what did live here? Sentient monsters of some sort?
Avallach|Look at those cliffs. Remind you of anything?
Geralt|Hmm… Look a bit like the bed of a giant river.
Avallach|Or the bottom of a sea.
Geralt|Mean there were water creatures here once?
Avallach|No creatures. Merely a sea.
Geralt|Trying to say that…?
Avallach|That there are many different worlds, and even more forms of life.
Avallach|Many of them intelligent, much more so, in fact, than you humans.
Avallach|But as it turns out, not even that could stop them from exhausting all the resources of their world. To the last drop.
Avallach|Three, two, one… Very good. On time.
Geralt|What a relief.
Avallach|Quickly! Jump in!
Avallach|Faster, Geralt!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Brrr… Cold.
Geralt|Freeze to death if I don't hide somewhere.
Geralt|And I gotta find that next passage quick.
Geralt|If I can just find cover along the way, I should make it to the passage.
Geralt|Light, in a place like this? Someone must've lit it.
Geralt|With any luck, it was a certain grouchy elven Sage.
Geralt|Finally. Warm up a bit.
Geralt|Course… What else? Might've expected this.
Geralt|Just one more wave…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What is this place? Feels like I've been here before.
Avallach|You have. You fought Eredin's projection here. Before that, Ciri fought here. For you.
Geralt|What're you talking about?
Avallach|Ever wondered how you managed to leave the Red Riders?
Geralt|Many times, but I don't remember a thing.
Avallach|Ciri came for you. She sensed you were in danger, tore you from the Hunt's grasp, then deposited you in the woods near Kaer Morhen.
Geralt|Did Eredin start hunting her because of that? Because of me? Why didn't she say anything?
Avallach|Ugh. What would it have changed?
Geralt|Doesn't look safe here, either. Let's go.
Avallach|This way.
Geralt|Where are we? World of the Aen Elle?
Avallach|No. This is Tedd Deireadh, the Time of the End. The world destroyed by the White Frost.
Avallach|Alas, this awaits us all, though at differing stages of our existence.
Geralt|So calm when you say that…
Avallach|Eredin succumbed to his knowledge of the apocalypse. Fear rules him now. I'll not commit the same error.
Geralt|Care to clarify?
Avallach|Not here, not now.
Geralt|Going after Ge'els is proving quite a trek, but I still don't know why he's so important.
Avallach|Eredin differs from the king he killed. Power for its own sake interests him. He has little patience for bureaucracy.
Avallach|He spends most of his time atop his steed, leading the Red Riders. So what does he need in the capital? A good viceroy.
Avallach|Ge'els is an excellent administrator and an even better plotter. He's the most dangerous individual amongst the Aen Elle.
Geralt|He got any weaknesses?
Avallach|Yes. He's righteous.
Geralt|I was hoping we wouldn't get separated.
Avallach|I warned you it could happen.
Geralt|Where'd your journey take you?
Avallach|Through a world whose sun had just died. I barely reached the next passage in time.
Geralt|Light on the peak - was that you?
Avallach|I thought it might aid your passage. After all, that is what lighthouses do - show the way.
Avallach|Took you a while. Did you run into trouble?
Geralt|Erm, no. Just taking in the sights.
Geralt|Next passage - when will it open?
Avallach|Shortly.
<|endoftext|>
Geels|I detect a shadow of impatience in your faces, it seems. So, what brings you here?
Avallach|I've come to tell you who killed our king.
Geels|You've gone through a great deal of trouble to reach me…
Geels|So I must believe you've put equal effort into preparing this lie.
Avallach|You shall see the truth. You will dream it.
Geels|You've an oneiromancer? Hmph.
Geels|My intuition was correct - this will be interesting.
Geralt|Tired of your pseudo-sophisticated courtesy. Let's go.
Geels|Where to, if I might ask?
Avallach|To the world of the Aen Seidhe.
Avallach|Directly, this time.
Geralt|Let's go. Before any guards show up.
Geralt|Better believe it. This way, please.
Geels|Witcher Geralt, a true man of action. Might I know where we're going?
Geels|Crevan Espane aep Caomhan Macha and the witcher of Rivia. Ceádmil.
Geels|Do you like my new model? Something of Lara Dorren about her, wouldn't you agree, Crevan?
Avallach|Her height, perhaps. Nothing more.
Geels|Ah, I see I've touched a tender spot… So let's change the subject, shall we? Care for a drink?
Geralt|Got any vodka?
Geralt|Oh, yeah, keep forgetting you don't touch that filth, disgraceful as it is.
Geels|Hmm… I must admit, you appearing here - quite the surprise, witcher.
Geels|Incidentally, interesting choice of allies. Do you think Avallac'h is honest with you? Just curious…
Geralt|I think that even among the Aen Elle elves there are those capable of being decent.
Geels|Naïvety is a fool's blessing…
Geralt|No. But honesty's not a facet of your species. So quit spewing bile, won't gain you anything.
Geralt|Didn't come here for tea.
Geralt|Shut your mouth or I'll shove a gag in it.
Elf Female 01|Oh! Who's this? And why are they here?
Geels|I believe we're done for the day, my tulip. Be a dear and leave us alone.
Geels|For I think we can agree this matter is between us and us alone, correct?
<|endoftext|>
Avallach|I take it I needn't introduce our guest.
Geels|Greetings, Zireael. So it's true - the Swallow has befriended the Fox.
Cirilla|There's naught you can do to make us turn on one another.
Geels|Avallac'h blackmailed you - do you not remember? Tried to force you to warm our king's bed?
Geels|Treated your body like a side of pork.
Cirilla|I remember. But I also remember what you advised Eredin do with me once I was caught. And I remember what the Red Riders did at Kaer Morhen.
Geels|I didn't come here to argue. The proof you promised, where is it?
Avallach|You will see it. In your dream.
Geels|Ah yes, the oneiromancer. Visions that cannot be fabricated. Do you wish to show me how Eredin murdered our king?
Geels|What then? Am I to incite the Aen Elle against Eredin? Call for revolution and proclaim Avallac'h our new king?
Geralt|Don't flatter yourself. Defy Eredin, that's all you need to do.
Geels|Very well. Have your oracle summon dreams of my king's last moments.
Avallach|We shall all dream them. To make certain there are no misunderstandings.
Geels|Why not.
Eredin|The king is dead. Long live the king.
Geels|You must face him on your terms, in this world, in a place of your choosing. It's your only chance.
Geels|Sail to Skellige and find the Sunstone. With it, you will summon the Naglfar. Eredin will come, too.
Geels|Should he call for reinforcements, no Aen Elle will answer.
Avallach|You have done the thing most just.
Avallach|A new portal to Tir ná Lia will open. I shall stabilize it, and you will return. Come with me.
Geralt|You'll do what you want. If you decide to continue serving the regicide, so be it. Wouldn't even be surprised.
Geralt|He got off cheap and easy… Sold us a few pieces of advice, some story about a Sunstone…
Avallach|He gave us his assurance that he'll not support Eredin. And that is quite a lot.
Cirilla|Seems to me you have a plan. Care to share it with us?
Avallach|Once we find the Sunstone, aided by your sorceresses and their magic, we shall draw Eredin's ship to a bay along the coast of Undvik.
Avallach|We will wait in ambush. Lay a trap. When the King of the Hunt arrives, we will spring it and kill him.
Geralt|Just like that?
Avallach|Defeating Eredin will be no small feat, but we will accomplish it.
Avallach|Find the sorceresses of the Lodge and we'll meet at the port. Then we sail to Skellige.
Avallach|Gather everyone and we'll meet at the port. Then we sail to Skellige.
Geralt|Just as well, could've been bluffing. Might've just said that so we'd let him go.
Geralt|Dammit. We should've pressed him.
Cirilla|Calm down. Avallac'h knows him better. We'll hear him out when he returns.
Geralt|Speak of the devil.
Cirilla|Geralt's worried. He believes we let Ge'els go too easily.
Geralt|Can never be too careful.
Avallach|Agreed. Yet I do believe Ge'els will keep his word, withhold support from Eredin.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Need to talk to you.
Sergeant|About?
Geralt|Uma - gonna take him with me.
Sergeant|Gotta ask the baron's permission. Thing is, he ain't 'ere.
Geralt|But that'd be an error. A mortal one.
Sergeant|Think you got me shakin' in my boots?
Geralt|You sure as hell should be.
Sergeant|Fine. Cripple's not worth no blood. See the groom. He oughta be glad to give 'im up, bugger's been eatin' from the feedbags. And a pleasant journey to you both.
Geralt|Thank you kindly.
Sergeant|Believe you meant to say you've come to ask my permission to take 'im. I am in charge now, so…
Geralt|But then I'll bring your enlightened reign to an end, an abrupt and premature end.
Geralt|Never mind. We'll talk later.
Geralt|Not about to ask for anything. I'm telling you. You can try to stop me.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|No. Not about to bring him back.
Geralt|Open the door. Now.
Geralt|Find something else to laugh at. I dunno, catch some frogs and shove straws up their asses…?
Baron Bandit Strong 02|Huh. That one of your witcher games?
Geralt|Witcher version's different. Don't make me show you.
Geralt|I'm taking Uma.
Baron Bandit Strong 02|There ain't a--
Geralt|Got the baron's permission.
Baron Bandit Strong 02|Bring 'im back, though, won't you? Be awful dull without 'im.
Geralt|Sergeant Ardal said I could.
<|endoftext|>
Emhyr|… and the Third Army will sweep in from the west to take Ban Gleán.
Voorhis|If I may, Your Imperial Majesty… Our spies report that the garrison at Ban Gleán consists almost wholly of mercenaries.
Emhyr|Bribery, then?
Voorhis|We stand to lose exactly no men in battle.
Emhyr|And we stand to lose less time. Very well, give the orders. Then set sail.
Voorhis|As you wish. At once.
Geralt|Your Imperial Majesty… Yennefer…
Emhyr|I did not have you brought here for an exchange of courtesies. Report.
Geralt|As you wish, Your Majesty.
Geralt|Ciri… Well, this… man is the key to finding her.
Ugliest Man Alive|Ummamamama…
Emhyr|I give you three solid leads, trails as fresh as morning dew, the aid of my spies and my court sorceress. Yet in my daughter's stead, you bring me this… monstrosity?
Emhyr|I hope you have more to say - for your sake.
Geralt|Listen, I'm looking for a needle in a haystack. A needle that at any moment can--
Emhyr|It's a difficult task, I know this. What of it?
Emhyr|Listen to me. I rule the largest empire the world has ever known. I wage a war against the North, command men in the tens of thousands, while at home, the trade corporations and nobles seek to depose me.
Emhyr|You cannot expect me to pity you the difficulty of your task.
Geralt|This "monstrosity" might well be your daughter. Its body is the product of a curse. Someone hides inside it.
Emhyr|Can you lift this curse?
Yennefer|I've done a great deal of research, made inquiries… but to lift it, I would need to know the words used to cast it, and that--
Geralt|"Va fail, elaine - cáed'mil, folie! Glaeddyv dorne aep t'enaid, bunn'droh ithne i'yachus."
Geralt|Dandelion told me. Ciri talked to him about it.
Emhyr|At last, you provide a pleasant surprise. Lady Yennefer, my question stands.
Yennefer|Yes. I believe I can. But I must--
Emhyr|The details do not interest me. Geralt, you've achieved precious little - yet admittedly more than the bumblers in my spy corps have. I give you half the promised reward. You will receive the other when you bring me Ciri.
Geralt|Wouldn't count on that happening.
Emhyr|That was no request. It was an order, Geralt. And I advise you well… Do not disobey me.
Emhyr|This audience is over. Till the next.
Geralt|So, how do we lift Uma's curse?
Yennefer|We must take him to Kaer Morhen.
Yennefer|I'll explain once we get there. Oh, and Geralt… Forgive me, but I'm unable to teleport you, Uma and Roach, so…
Geralt|Don't worry. We'll ride there. Never did like teleporting.
Yennefer|Take care of yourself.
Geralt|Wait.
Geralt|Here.
Geralt|Probably better if you keep it.
Yennefer|Of course.
Yennefer|I'm off.
Geralt|Could've used some of that famous biting wit of yours. Where'd it disappear to? I mean, you were meek as a novice at Aretuza called in to the dean's office.
Yennefer|I merely know when I can indulge my pride, and when I must swallow it.
Geralt|Ah, I see. So you show your claws to me because I'm a lowly witcher, but--
Yennefer|Do you really wish to do this now, Geralt?
Yennefer|We can fight another time, in another place. Where the walls have no ears.
Yennefer|Unlike some others I know.
Geralt|Yen, what happened back there - in Skellige...
Yennefer|Please, Geralt. There's nothing left to say.
Geralt|Yen...
Yennefer|No more. Please.
Geralt|Fine.
Geralt|I pursued those leads you gave me.
Geralt|Ciri first reappeared in Skellige. With a mage, an elf. Yen knows more.
Yennefer|The Wild Hunt tracked them down, found them there. They were forced to flee to Velen.
Geralt|Where they were separated. Ciri spent some time with a local warlord, a self-styled baron who--
Emhyr|Yes, yes. I know my vassals.
Geralt|…who helped her get to Novigrad, where Ciri crossed some of the city's underworld bosses. She had to flee, went back to Skellige. Ran into her elf companion there.
Yennefer|And into the Wild Hunt, again. Ciri and the elf fled, out to sea this time. Their boat returned to shore the next day with only him on board.
Emhyr|Hm… The information appears of little use. Though, at least, it seems you kept busy.
Geralt|No courtesies needed? Perfect.
Geralt|But remember, I'm not your soldier, or page, or dog. So don't give me any orders.
Emhyr|Would you prefer I order my guards? Look around. I need only beckon.
Yennefer|Geralt!
Emhyr|Now report.
<|endoftext|>
Vesemir|And your journey - how was it?
Geralt|Calm, if you don't count the forktail that flew over our heads a few miles back. Passenger got a little restless.
Ugliest Man Alive|Uuummmmma…
Vesemir|Hm, what have we here? Multiple deformities. Eyes, ears, nostrils. A harelip. And is this…?
Ugliest Man Alive|Ummmamamama!
Vesemir|Now, now. Calm down… Yennefer was right on one count… Thing sure isn't pretty.
Geralt|Yen's here already?
Vesemir|And how.
Geralt|Huh… You two argue?
Vesemir|Geralt… I understand she's a-- well, how do I put this? Emancipated, strong-willed woman… But do manners count for nothing?
Vesemir|She teleports in, not even a "nice to see you." Jumps right into, uh - "We've a curse to lift. There's this to do, and that - so Eskel and Lambert, get going." Then she went to the guest room, to rearrange things… threw the bed off the balcony.
Geralt|So where is everyone?
Vesemir|Eskel's hunting forktails. Gotta nip that infestation in the bud, and since Yennefer needs to distill some ingredients from their organs… Well, like they say, two birds, one stone.
Vesemir|Lambert's still in the keep, preparing to venture into the mountains to enrich the phylactery with elemental power.
Geralt|Mhm. And Yen?
Vesemir|Assembling her megascope. Wanted my help - running around with some chirping contraption, searching for something. But I'm too old for that… nonsense.
Geralt|I should let her know I'm here.
Vesemir|If you say so. But… Don't go thinking she'll throw her arms around your neck.
Geralt|So what's Yen planning?
Vesemir|Wish I knew.
Geralt|Mean she didn't tell you?
Vesemir|She told us what she needs to lift the curse, not what she plans to do with it. Despite our asking.
Geralt|She's up to something…
Vesemir|Glad you noticed.
Geralt|She's gotta have a good reason…
Vesemir|Huh, more than one, most likely… In any case, she's set her mind on something. Needs us to stay out of her way, mostly.
Geralt|Shame, that was a good bed.
Vesemir|Said the same myself. Solid oak frame, down mattress. Triss always said she--
Vesemir|Aaaah… Now I see.
Geralt|It's either that, or Yen really hates oak furniture.
Geralt|Don't look all that nice yourself. How'd you get so dirty?
Vesemir|Huh? Ah, this… I was mixing some lime for the mortar. Need to patch up the walls before they crumble.
Geralt|Lotta work for one person. Lambert and Eskel not willing to help? Don't see the sense in it?
Vesemir|No. Yennefer found more important things for them to do.
Geralt|Whoa there, Roach. It's all right.
Geralt|Forktails this close to the fortress? Someone's been slacking off…
Vesemir|Well, look who the wind blew in! Been away quite a while.
Geralt|Too long.
<|endoftext|>
Vesemir|Look. Like that? Pretty, isn't it?
Ugliest Man Alive|Ummmmamamama…
Vesemir|Interesting… Not afraid of silver.
Vesemir|Pulse weak… but regular…
Vesemir|Look at the fire… Now look here…
Vesemir|Pupils functioning normally…
Ugliest Man Alive|Ummmmamama.
Vesemir|Hold this.
Ugliest Man Alive|Umamamma.
Vesemir|No reaction to dimeritium.
<|endoftext|>
Yennefer|Akh akh akh… Damned crystal! Akh akh…
Geralt|You decide to blow us up?
Yennefer|Geralt, I'm in no mood for jests. Especially dull ones.
Geralt|What's eating you?
Yennefer|Let me think - that was the… third crystal to explode. It's been a week and Lambert's still not done what I've asked. Vesemir spitefully insists on repairing the wall just beneath my window and starts hammering at the crack of dawn, while Eskel seems to have gone mushroom picking, not forktail hunting.
Geralt|The guys… well, they're not exactly happy with you.
Yennefer|Mhm. Why is that?
Geralt|Because… you aren't willing to say what you're planning. You're treating them like pages, not including them - us, actually, 'cause I feel that way, too.
Yennefer|I shall explain everything - when the time is right. First, we must finish our preparations.
Geralt|Fine… What do I do?
Yennefer|Firstly, help Eskel and Lambert. One was supposed to get me forktail spinal fluid, the other was to fortify the phylactery with elemental power. I've yet to see anything from either of them.
Geralt|All right, I'll talk to them. Anything else?
Yennefer|Yes. There's one other trifling matter.
Yennefer|As you saw, my megascope's acting up… in rather spectacular fashion.
Yennefer|I'm certain there's an energy source nearby, generating disturbances, making the crystals malfunction. We must find it and neutralize it… quickly - I must contact someone, it's urgent.
Geralt|All right, how do I find the source?
Yennefer|Use this potestaquisitor.
Geralt|Potesta… Potestaquisitor? Sounds fancy, complicated.
Yennefer|Yet it's ever so simple. Grasp it firmly, move it around, and the louder it squeals, the closer you are.
Geralt|Mhm…
Yennefer|Spare me your juvenile wit, please. Well? What're you waiting for?
Yennefer|Ah! One more thing…
Geralt|Mhm?
Yennefer|Thank you, Geralt.
Geralt|Who you plan to contact? Or is that a secret, too?
Yennefer|First off, stop pouting. Second - no, it's no secret. Ida Emean. Remember her?
Geralt|How could I forget. Member of the Lodge… Elven Sage.
Yennefer|Exactly. A Sage. As the name suggests, she should know a great deal. I'd like to ask her for advice about Uma. Satisfied?
Geralt|Hmph… Your sorceress friends - the sage and not so sage - they've let me down before. But if we gotta, we gotta.
Yennefer|If only you'd been this cautious with all of them… But no matter. Thank you for your permission.
Yennefer|No secret at all. Ida Emean. Remember her?
Geralt|Already helped Lambert, I'll go see what Eskel's up to. Anything else?
Geralt|Already helped Eskel, I can check on Lambert. Anything else?
Geralt|Taken care of.
Yennefer|Is that so…? My, the initiative. That leaves one other trifle to resolve.
Geralt|Hm. You got trust issues with us?
Yennefer|Ugh. No… Actually, I fear you don't trust me. So I'd rather keep certain things secret - for the time being.
Geralt|Pretty tortured logic…
Yennefer|It may seem that way now… But you'll understand in time.
Geralt|Heard about the bed… Really prefer to sleep on the floor? Wouldn't recommend it. That stone can get awfully chilly.
Yennefer|Frankly, I prefer a chill to bedding littered with red hair.
Geralt|Ah. So it is about Triss.
Yennefer|Yes. It's about our dear darling Triss.
Yennefer|Know what…? We should end this discussion - before I say something I'll regret.
Geralt|But I'd love to hear what you have to say.
Yennefer|Is that so? Very well then. Listen.
Yennefer|You shagged my friend. For upwards of a year. I cannot know what your witchers' code says on the matter, but ordinary folk would consider it obscene, base, vile.
Yennefer|I try not to think about it… That stupid bed was making it difficult. That's that.
Geralt|Come on. Triss? That's the past. You know that.
Yennefer|I do. But that does not mean I've forgotten it.
Yennefer|Very well… On to more pressing matters. We've a great deal of work to do.
Geralt|Not about to grovel, if that's what you're after.
Yennefer|I tire of this conversation. It ends. Now.
Geralt|That… was a mistake.
Yennefer|I'm glad you realize it. A mistake engaged in regularly for more than a year, an apology well after the fact, but… I'm glad.
Geralt|Yen… Told you already. I lost my memory.
Yennefer|And I've lost my patience.
Geralt|If that's what you want.
Yennefer|Knew I could count on your better judgment.
Yennefer|Geralt… I don't want to seem like a vindictive shrew, but that very bed is where you just happened to fuck a dear friend of mine.
Yennefer|Yes, I know. You'd lost your memory. Whatever…
Yennefer|Let us agree that I will refrain from scolding you, while you will stop mentioning that stupid bed. Agreed?
Geralt|Agreed.
Yennefer|Splendid. On to more pressing matters.
Geralt|So upset about Triss you gotta take it out on the furniture?
Yennefer|Would you prefer I take it out some other way?
Geralt|Need to blow off steam? Go ahead, just not on me. Find some other target. I don't know… throw another bed off the balcony.
Yennefer|Ha, ha, ha. So it's to be dull jokes after all?
Geralt|Rather have a serious conversation? We can do that, if you prefer.
Geralt|I mean, what got into you? That determined to make Vesemir your enemy?
Yennefer|No. I was determined not to sleep in the bed in which you swived Triss. Repeatedly.
Yennefer|Geralt… I'm sorry, but I'm in no mood for jests.
Geralt|Sorry… Pretty dumb excuse.
Yennefer|Extremely stupid. I'm glad a mere whiff of fresh air helped you realize that.
Geralt|Mhm. The view from there - spectacular.
Yennefer|Perhaps I should've teleported you two miles higher? Breathtaking, that view! To die for, really.
Yennefer|Ah, Geralt… Anything you'd like to say?
Yennefer|Certainly wouldn't hurt. But even a modicum of understanding would suffice.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Disturbance is coming from there.
Geralt|What's in these crates?
Vesemir|Dimeritium bombs. Lambert made 'em.
Geralt|No wonder the megascope doesn't work. All right, gotta get 'em outta here.
Vesemir|I can do that. Rather you not make a mess of my shelves. Just keep an eye on Uma.
Geralt|Yes, Uncle Vesemir.
Geralt|How goes it? Vesemir's not working you too hard, I hope?
Ugliest Man Alive|Uma.
Geralt|Thought so.
Vesemir|All done. You can go.
Vesemir|Now… let's check your conditioned reflexes…
<|endoftext|>
Yennefer|Thank you. Seems to be working now. What was it?
Geralt|Dimeritium bombs. Lambert left them by the beds.
Yennefer|Mhm. I suppose he had no idea they could interfere with my megascope?
Geralt|No, he probably knew… But that's the sort of prank you only pull on someone you like.
Yennefer|You don't suppose he--? Lambert? Really? I'm flattered.
Yennefer|But no matter… More importantly, I shall finally be able to contact Ida.
Geralt|The Ida? Elven Sage? What do you want from her?
Yennefer|Stay and you'll learn for yourself.
Geralt|Members of the Lodge don't let just anyone in on their secrets… or so I've heard.
Yennefer|Consider it a token of our trust. Now, let's begin. And, Geralt, behave - please?
Geralt|Didn't you just say you trust me?
Yennefer|Stop twisting my words.
Ida Emean|Cáed'mil, Yennefer aep Vengerberg. Gwynbleidd.
Geralt|Ceádmil, Aen Saevherne.
Ida Emean|Why have you summoned me?
Yennefer|We've come up against a curse, one we must lift. It was uttered in a dialect of Elder Speech unfamiliar to me.
Ida Emean|I see… The words of the curse?
Yennefer|Va fail, elaine - cáed'mil, folie! Glaeddyv dorne aep t'enaid, bunn'droh ithne i'yachus.
Geralt|Take it you've heard the words before.
Ida Emean|Yes… In legends. Of the kind that do not end happily.
Yennefer|Can you help us… with the curse?
Ida Emean|To a degree. Agnes de Glanville's incantation combined with Eldar's Triangle - inverted, of course - they are your only possible recourse. But I cannot guarantee that even they will suffice.
Yennefer|Thank you, Aen Saevherne. Va fail.
Ida Emean|That does not conclude our conversation.
Geralt|Lemme guess… you want something in return.
Ida Emean|If I may, Gwynbleidd, I'd like to request - stop guessing. Just listen.
Ida Emean|The Time of the White Frost and White Light is nigh…
Geralt|… and the world will perish amidst ice. I know Ithlinne's prophecy.
Ida Emean|I don't doubt you know it. But do you understand it?
Ida Emean|The Elder Blood can initiate the Final Age, the Time of the End… or stop it. Remember this, Gwynbleidd. For you will be the one to determine if the seed bursts into flames.
Geralt|All in all, interesting conversation. What now?
Yennefer|Finish whatever it was you and the boys were planning to do… Then we'll begin.
Yennefer|All is ready. We should gather the others and begin.
Yennefer|You can start by apologizing for acting like a boor. Despite my asking you not to.
Geralt|I'm sorry. It's just, when Ida started in with that patronizing tone--
Yennefer|You decided to prove she was completely justified to adopt that attitude? Well done, Geralt. Bravo.
Yennefer|Ugh. Oh, enough.
Geralt|Don't really see why I should apologize. I know sorceresses expect me to bow down before them…
Yennefer|So you refuse to bow and thumb your nose at them instead. Very mature.
Geralt|Any idea what she was talking about?
Yennefer|Ciri, of course.
Geralt|Wish everyone'd just leave her the hell alone.
Yennefer|Wouldn't count on it.
Geralt|What was that about… the Migration?
Yennefer|Good gods! Did they teach you no history here?
Geralt|No. Vesemir figured sword work'd be more useful on the Path. Gonna answer me?
Yennefer|Naturally. One's never too old to learn.
Yennefer|The Aen Seidhe and the Aen Elle elves were once one folk, the Aen Undod. Then came a cataclysm, no one knows its nature. The Aen Undod were forced to leave their world. They split along the way.
Geralt|So if Uma's curse was uttered in this Laith aen Undod…
Yennefer|Then it's old. Very, very old.
Geralt|What is it?
Geralt|Recognize the dialect?
Ida Emean|Laith aen Undod.
Geralt|Meaning?
Yennefer|The so-called One Speech… A forgotten language dating from before the Migration.
Geralt|The Migration?
Yennefer|Later, Geralt.
Geralt|Hey there, Ida.
Yennefer|Geralt…
Ida Emean|It matters not, Yennefer. I've grown accustomed to human… decorum.
Yennefer|Enough. Ready for this conversation?
Geralt|Sure you want me here? Members of the Lodge don't let just anyone in on their secrets… or so I've heard.
Geralt|You know… Lambert's not exactly an expert on megascopes, so--
Yennefer|Please. Lambert is mean, not stupid.
<|endoftext|>
Eskel|De ole hen she cackled, she cackled on de fence… de ole hen she cackled, an she ain't cackled sence.
Geralt|What's that song?
Eskel|Some old hill-folk tune, perfect for hiking… My mom sang it to me.
Geralt|You remember her?
Eskel|Just that silly song. Nothing else.
Geralt|Not scared to leave the horse down below? Forktail could decide to have at him…
Eskel|Bah… Scorpion's a war horse, a purebred Kaedweni. He'll be fine. Have I told you how I got him?
Geralt|No… don't think so.
Eskel|Saved this lost knight once… You know, woods, dark, wolves. The standard.
Eskel|Told him, "Give me what you find at home" and all that… No kid this time, but his mare had just foaled.
Geralt|Eskel and Scorpion… Bound by fate. An enchanting tale.
Eskel|Mock me all you want. You're just jealous.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Must be Eskel's prints… No one else has left the keep recently.
Geralt|Footprints… and hoofprints. A goat. Interesting…
Geralt|That's his horse… what's it's name? Scorpion? Beautiful animal…
Geralt|Eskel made camp here… Looks like he planned to stay outside a while.
Geralt|All right… Let's see where this aroma leads me.
Geralt|Rocks… tracks end here. Great.
Geralt|Could try to follow my nose. Can't smell Eskel, but there is the goat… Just gotta find a sample of its scent.
Geralt|A clump of goat hair. Oof, the stench…
Geralt|Damn… Can't smell a thing. Must've lost the trail.
Geralt|Bits of bark… Looks like Eskel's goat rubbed against this tree.
Geralt|Ha, Eskel's tracks… The nose knows.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|"As for forktails, bait them thusly: pound a stake in the soil, bind a goat to it, then hide ye in nearto shrubbery posthaste."
Eskel|Brother Adalbert's bestiary, page eighty-two. See your memory's back in full, and sharp as ever, in spite of your years.
Geralt|Whereas you're getting hard of hearing in your old age… Squawking grouse could've snuck up on you.
Eskel|Nah, heard you panting from three miles away. Just didn't wanna give up that vantage point.
Eskel|Good to finally see you again.
Geralt|Yen's keepin' you pretty busy, huh?
Eskel|Mhh. Started shouting out orders with just one foot outta the teleport. I tried to get a word in edgewise, to which she said--
Geralt|"One should not interrupt a lady."
Eskel|Exactly. Times like these I'm glad this ugly mug of mine keeps the women away.
Geralt|Come on. You're a handsome guy in your own way…
Eskel|Geralt, please… Cut the crap.
Eskel|Shh! Hear that? Incoming!
Geralt|Looks aren't everything - certainly not to all women.
Eskel|You're right… But most like a full purse, too. Don't have much to brag about in that domain either.
Geralt|You too. How are things?
Eskel|Same ol', same ol'. Another day, another drowner.
Geralt|That it?
Eskel|I'm a simple witcher, Wolf. Don't fight dragons, don't fraternize with kings and don't sleep with sorceresses… Unlike some.
Geralt|Fame's not all it's made out to be… Consider myself lucky if I were you.
Eskel|You're right. Takes a lotta champagne to wash down all that caviar. That is tough goin'.
Geralt|Try to limit myself to the sorceresses from now on.
Eskel|No doubt the most pleasant part… though I'm not sure it ain't the most dangerous, too.
Geralt|You're as old as I am, wise guy. Don't let the gray hair fool you.
<|endoftext|>
Eskel|Foul, overgrown reptiles - hate it when they do that… Mighta saved us some trouble, let us kill it now.
Geralt|Mhm. Then maybe gut itself, run a spit down its throat and out its ass?
Eskel|Damn straight. Doubt the beast's that well-mannered, though… We gotta climb.
Geralt|Bit of exercise'll do you good.
Eskel|Huh?
Geralt|Well… you've rounded out a bit… Still got some of last winter's blubber on you.
Eskel|Speak for yourself, funny bunny…
Geralt|That a problem?
Eskel|No… Just… my last hunt in mountains, griffin knocked me off a rock face.
Geralt|Ouch.
Eskel|Yeah. Dropped twelve yards, twisted my ankle, broke a rib… But you shoulda seen the griffin.
Eskel|Right, talked enough. We've got a goat to avenge.
Eskel|Let's go… Lemme just untie Lil' Bleater.
Geralt|Lil' Bleater… Make it home all right on his own?
Eskel|Course. Not the first hunt he's helped me with. C'mon. Get.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Gonna tell me which side of the knife to cut with next?
Eskel|The sharp one. C'mon, hurry up.
Geralt|Yen tell you why she wants this?
Eskel|Mean you don't know?
Eskel|And that, uh… doesn't bug you?
Geralt|Course it does… Don't see us lifting the curse without her, though.
Eskel|We could've gone to Triss for help.
Geralt|Put it to you this way… If Yen can't help Uma, we can always go to Triss - she won't hold it against us. But if we'd done it the other way around…
Eskel|Oof… There'd be hell to pay.
Geralt|Exactly. Enough of this talk. Let's go.
Geralt|No, it doesn't. I trust her.
Eskel|And they say people learn from their mistakes…
Geralt|What was that?
Eskel|Nothing, nothing.
Geralt|Great. Let's go.
Geralt|Something about Yen bothering you? C'mon, grow a pair, give it to me straight.
Eskel|You grow a pair and admit she tricked you. More than a few times.
Geralt|That was then. Yen's changed.
Eskel|Right. Fine, never mind… Let's go.
Eskel|All right. Let's collect the spinal fluid and get outta here.
Eskel|Cut into its back, just below the skull.
<|endoftext|>
Eskel|"I could beat you riding a lame sow"… Good one.
Geralt|Underestimated you… Or should I say Scorpion. One fast mount.
Eskel|And I overestimated you. If I'd known it'd be that easy I'd 'ave bet something on it…
Geralt|All right. Name your prize. Earned it.
Eskel|Hm… Had this craving for Mahakaman spirit a while now. Nothin' burns quite like it.
Geralt|Have a bottle for you next time we meet. Promise.
Eskel|Hold you to that.
Geralt|As luck would have it, gotta bottle with me… Here.
Eskel|Damn… Must've read my mind long range!
Geralt|Nah. Enjoy a swig from time to time, just like you.
Eskel|Right… Vesemir used to say he couldn't tell us apart. Like brothers, two drops of water… A long time ago, that. Thanks.
Geralt|Bet you next time. Thing is, I'll win.
Eskel|Yeah. Sure.
Geralt|Finally! Took you a while.
Eskel|Saddle kept sliding…
Geralt|Mhm. Not a crappy show dancer out there who doesn't blame her shoes.
Eskel|You're a fucking show dancer - but one who's damn good on horseback. Didn't wager anything, but can't help thinking you deserve a prize.
Geralt|C'mon, not gonna take anything from you. Buy me a round some time and we'll call it good.
Eskel|Done deal.
Geralt|Since you insist…
Eskel|Here. Use it wisely.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Been thinking… We gonna swim across the pond?
Lambert|No, I got a boat moored there. You know, for fishing.
Geralt|Wow… Never took you for the fishing type.
Lambert|I use bombs. Drop 'em in, then scoop up whatever floats to the surface.
Geralt|Hm. That makes sense.
Lambert|Uh-oh. Looks like someone beat us to it.
Lambert|Dammit… Gonna chain that boat down next time.
Geralt|Stop talking and listen.
Geralt|Make this boat yourself?
Lambert|Yeah. Something you don't like about it?
Geralt|Besides the water up to our ankles? Nothing.
Lambert|Quit whining… It'll make it across the lake.
Geralt|Provided we don't smash into something first. Barely see the tip of my nose.
Geralt|Fog's thick as curdled milk…
Lambert|Never took you for a poet.
Geralt|Oh, but I am one. Wanna hear a limerick?
Lambert|Sure.
Geralt|Lambert, Lambert - what a prick.
Lambert|Not bad.
Geralt|Mind not stomping like that?
Lambert|Relax… I slipped.
Lambert|Ugh!
Geralt|What?
Lambert|Something fell in my eye. A splinter, I think.
Geralt|Hope it wasn't from a broken mirror… That'd make you even nastier.
Lambert|Ha, ha.
Lambert|Oof, place reeks of mould…
Geralt|What'd you expect? Scent of violets?
Lambert|Would've been nice…
Lambert|Think you might've missed your calling.
Geralt|Hm?
Lambert|If I remember Pappy Vesemir's lessons correctly, witchers kill monsters.
Geralt|Your memory's shit. They only kill harmful monsters.
Lambert|They threw stones at us, Geralt.
Geralt|Whine about it to Eskel later.
Lambert|Just… a few steps more… and we're there.
Geralt|Oo, that's some serious panting. Out of breath, out of shape.
Lambert|Nah… Just a bit… hungover.
Geralt|Been hitting the hooch with Eskel again?
Lambert|No… Been hitting it alone…
Lambert|How'd it go? Water, then earth… then air?
Lambert|Right… Almost there.
Lambert|Hah! See 'im shit and run soon as he saw us?
Geralt|Mhm. Never known a troll to do that.
Lambert|Dammit… Blocked.
Geralt|Relax… Aard oughta take care of it.
Lambert|Now that's the kind of negotiating I understand.
Geralt|Thought you might like it.
Lambert|And I thought you'd drag that conversation out forever… Surprised me.
Geralt|Even my patience has its limits.
Geralt|Savolla's breach. Still haven't patched it up?
Lambert|Vesemir'd like to. Doesn't bother me, though.
Lambert|Not expecting anyone to lay siege and… this way I got a shortcut to the pond.
Geralt|Shame those Salamandra assassins didn't punch a few more holes in our walls.
Lambert|Or finish the job and reduce these ruins to rubble.
Geralt|Tell me about Vesemir - things any better between you?
Lambert|Seems so… Old man's dropped the moralizing, and I try not to piss him off too often.
Geralt|Mhm. Working out well?
Lambert|Moderately. Castle's pretty big. Easy to stay out of each other's way.
Lambert|Hm, see you changed your mind. Good call.
Lambert|Hey! Thought we were going straight to the cave?
Geralt|Shhh. Shut up and follow my lead.
Lambert|And they call me grumpy…
Geralt|Fall off a bit, sail's fluttering.
Lambert|Don't teach your grandma to suck eggs.
Lambert|Hmm… Wall looks a little shaky… Aard, maybe?
Geralt|Mhm. And wake Old Speartip?
Lambert|What? You afraid?
Geralt|No. I just think before I act.
Geralt|Water hag...
Lambert|Great. Last thing we needed.
Lambert|Harpies. Lovely.
Geralt|Relax. I'll shoot 'em down.
Lambert|Hope your aim's good. They smash the boat, we'll be in for a nice swim.
Lambert|Nice shot.
Geralt|And that'd be about it.
Lambert|Well, well, color me impressed. Where'd you learn them tricks?
Geralt|It's an art. Learned it from this old master down in Zerrikania.
Lambert|Pfff. Yadda yadda. Save that tale for your next sorceress.
Lambert|Hunting's almost a diversion with that gabriel. Gotta get me one.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|No reason to wait. Let's go.
Geralt|Gotta take care of something. Wait for me.
Lambert|Sure.
Lambert|Everything's ready at my end.
Geralt|What's this? Brewing potions?
Lambert|No. Booze. From potato peels.
Geralt|Mm. For my welcome back feast?
Lambert|Actually, more like my farewell feast…
Lambert|Haven't heard? Madame sorceress has requested I fortify the phylactery with Power from the Circle of Elements. Says it's essential to lifting the curse from that monstrosity of yours.
Geralt|Don't sound too thrilled about all this.
Lambert|I'm not. You know the trek to the Circle's no walk in the park. In more ways than one.
Geralt|Lemme go with you.
Lambert|Well… Might have more spring in my step with the famous White Wolf at my side. So… you ready?
Geralt|Realize that monstrosity, as you put it, might be Ciri?
Lambert|Yeah. I heard.
Geralt|Mind showing a bit of sympathy?
Lambert|I call 'em like I see 'em. That's how I am.
Geralt|Irritating, you mean?
Lambert|Thought you liked people with bitchy streaks.
Geralt|So long as they're women.
Lambert|Then you found the best of 'em. Enough about that. The Circle of Elements awaits.
Geralt|Know what? Never mind. Not gonna argue with you.
Lambert|Right, no time to lose. The monstrosity awaits.
Geralt|Lambert!
Lambert|Oh, sorry. The potential Cirilla.
<|endoftext|>
Lambert|All right. Cave entrance is just opposite. See it?
Lambert|Gotta sail across the pond, go through the cave, climb Troll's Head… and we're there.
Geralt|Doesn't seem like such an ordeal now, does it?
Lambert|No… Still gives me the shivers, though. You know only two boys returned from my group?
Geralt|You were the ones who ran into Old Speartip in the caverns, right?
Lambert|Mhm.
Geralt|Let's go. Jump in the boat.
Lambert|All right. I'm taking the tiller, though.
Geralt|Because…?
Lambert|Cause it's my boat. Not up for discussion.
Geralt|That still gnawing at you?
Lambert|Gnawing? No. Straight old pisses me off.
Lambert|What the fuck was that Trial for? Most who returned from the Circle of Elements died within a year in some swamp, hunting drowners for a crown thirty a head. So exactly what was the point?
Geralt|Oughta ask Vesemir.
Lambert|Oh, I have, many times. Believe you me.
<|endoftext|>
Lambert|An illusion… Who woulda thunk?
Geralt|You're not gonna let this drop anytime soon, are you?
Lambert|No, I will not. In fact, whole world should hear about the time the famed Geralt of Rivia was duped like a child. Think we oughta get Dandelion to write a ballad about it. How's that sound?
Geralt|Dandelion should sing about you instead. "Lambert, the Smart-Ass Witcher."
Lambert|Better that than naive. Smart asses live longer.
Geralt|Changing subjects… Did I see right? Was that boy--?
Lambert|Yeah. One of ours. Must've drowned during his Trial… Foglets remembered his voice and appearance.
Geralt|Charming…. Let's get out of here.
Lambert|Needn't ask me twice. In fact, I didn't even wanna come here.
Geralt|Lambert, enough.
Geralt|When someone's life might be threatened, I'd rather be safe than sorry. Enough said.
Lambert|Course. The noble White Wolf never abandons a man in need. He's more saint than witcher!
<|endoftext|>
Lambert|Hear that?
Geralt|Mhm. Old Speartip's looking for us already.
Lambert|Something tells me he's not gonna like this…
Geralt|Bones… Pulverized.
Lambert|Mhm. Old Speartip's never been kind to guests.
Lambert|Get ready… He's coming.
Lambert|You miss me, whoreson?
Lambert|Ah, so soft and sweet, just sleepin' there… Makes you wanna make this moment last forever…
Geralt|We need to be quiet… I could do without a warm welcome from Old Speartip.
Geralt|Just lost the element of surprise.
Lambert|Couldn't care less. I'm up for the challenge.
<|endoftext|>
Lambert|Have a nice swim? Water not too cold for you?
Geralt|Nope. Just right.
Lambert|You're one strange duck… But I suppose I knew that already.
Lambert|Ready for the caverns?
Geralt|Almost. Before we go inside--
Lambert|Ugh, drink a dose of Cat, I know. Any more words of wisdom? Like, "Step softly or you'll wake Old Speartip?"
Geralt|Sheesh. You're pricklier than Yen…
Lambert|Ugh. Don't fall in love with me. Let's go.
Verden Boy 03|Aaaah! Help!
Geralt|Hear that? Sounds like a kid…
Lambert|You know this valley's uninhabited except for us. Gotta be an illusion.
Geralt|What if it's not?
Verden Boy 03|Aaa… Aaaaaah!
Lambert|Whatever you want to do…
Geralt|We'll investigate. Just in case.
Lambert|You know, Vesemir's right. You do poke the damn hive, almost always. Fine. Let's go.
Geralt|You're probably right… Let's go - straight to the cave.
Lambert|Finally, something reasonable.
Geralt|Old Speartip's still down there?
Lambert|Yeah, he is - unless he's done us a favor and keeled over on his own. Could come at us at any moment.
Geralt|How'd the rhyme go? Old Speartip's a deep sleeper…
Lambert|Wake him up and you'll sleep deeper. C'mon.
<|endoftext|>
Lambert|Oof… Good to be back above ground.
Geralt|Mhm… Still trouble ahead.
Lambert|Mean the trolls? They're in for trouble, not us.
Geralt|Dunno who you're trying to impress. Tough-guy stuff's just not working on me.
Lambert|Heh, look who's talking. Vesemir told me about that job you did for those Nilfgaardians in Velen.
Lambert|What… what are you doing?! "Killing monsters." Haha, good one.
Geralt|Just came out that way…
Geralt|C'mon.
Geralt|We oughta be careful. This is their turf.
Lambert|Couple of trolls got you soiling your knickers?
Geralt|Was bold and brash once, like you. Then I took a pitchfork in the gut. Peasant kid, not a troll - I almost died. Hard way to learn, but I did.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|You gonna live?
Lambert|Mhm. Probably.
Geralt|Let's get outta here.
Lambert|Wait.
Lambert|That's for Voltehre, you whoreson. Ptoo!
Geralt|You finished?
Lambert|Let's move.
Geralt|Voltehre… Who's that?
Lambert|Ya don't remember? Little guy, scar on his chin, right here.
Geralt|Oh, yeah. I remember.
Lambert|All we can do now. Never made it outta here.
Lambert|Let's go.
<|endoftext|>
Troll_1|Oooo. Witcherses two, walk no more… stops! This mountain trolly mountain.
Troll_2|Troll mountain.
Troll_1|Huh? Ah… Aye. This troll mountain!
Lambert|Ugh… You talk to these idiots.
Geralt|Stay calm… We just wanna get to the Circle.
Troll_1|Witcherses thing one say, thing two do.
Troll_2|Thing three do. Sometime.
Lambert|Argh, enough. Outta my way, dimwits, or I'll grind you to gravel. Understand?!
Geralt|Mhm. They understood all right. Congrats.
Lambert|Run for the cave… Before they stone us to death.
Geralt|Take my advice. You don't wanna mess with us.
Troll_1|Trolly advice take!
Troll_2|No… Trolls' advice! And witcherses takes must it!
<|endoftext|>
Troll_1|We rocks throws - yous goes no farmore. Witcherses understanded?
Geralt|We understanded. But we still gotta get to the Circle of Elements.
Troll_2|Listen, Butwe. Trolls come no to witchersy castle.
Troll_3|Rock lots there. Pretty rock.
Lambert|Enjoying this little chat? 'Cause, er, it's not getting us anywhere.
Geralt|Yeah. Gonna have to agree to disagree.
Lambert|Finally. My brain's gonna ooze out my ears if I have to listen to this bullshit any longer.
Lambert|All right, calcites and dolomites. Who wants to taste some witchers' silver?
Troll_2|I itsay. No should trusty witcherses!
Geralt|I'm talking. Fact is you know as much about negotiating as they do about grammar.
Geralt|We're not here to hurt you. We don't wanna touch your rocks. Just let us pass.
Troll_2|Troll rock throw… Witcherses strike no back. Just talkie-talkie. Witcher… good?
Troll_3|Dummy you. Witcherses monster kills. Trolls monsters… Yes, true is, no face make!
Troll_1|Hmmm… We do go this. Yous sharp backclubs leave here, yous pass. No agrees - we smash.
Geralt|All right. We'll leave our swords here. Pick 'em up on the way back.
Troll_1|We them want no.
Troll_3|Ick metal. Mouth stings.
Lambert|You nuts?!
Geralt|Shut up and follow my lead.
Geralt|No way. Witcher without his sword - it'd be like losing an arm.
Troll_1|Better arm lose than head!
Troll_1|Witcher say hurt no. But before at troll hit! So hit hard big ouch! Spot!
Troll_3|Before throws too trolls. Trolls throws first, witchrses hit then!
Troll_1|Witchrses throws on trolls - ouch… Trolls on witcherses throws - ouch. Ouch here, ouch there…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Well… We made it.
Lambert|No denying that.
Lambert|Damn… Beautiful view.
Geralt|Must be if you noticed it.
Lambert|Geralt, who do you take me for?
Geralt|Lemme think… a sourpuss?
Lambert|Hah! Fair enough, but save the rest of your compliments for later. Let's get to work.
Geralt|Remember how this Circle works? Been a while since I activated my medallion here…
Lambert|It's fine, old man, no need to make excuses. Light the torches and place the phylactery on the altar. I'll handle the rest.
Geralt|We can soak it in later.
Lambert|Of course. Duty before pleasure.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|All right… Phylactery's in place.
Lambert|Then all we gotta do is wait. The container'll absorb the Power of the elements… while we catch a breather.
Lambert|Oof… So, how'd you deal with the trolls when you passed the Trial of the Medallion?
Geralt|Lemme think… Oh yeah. Used Axii. But I only had to get past one troll. Other two were busy.
Lambert|Yeah, useful sign, Axii. Saved my life a short while ago.
Geralt|Yeah, Axii's useful… and dangerous.
Lambert|Hmph. What makes you say that?
Geralt|It tempts you to overuse it. Force a merchant to reduce his price, make an arrogant noble drink from the gutter, teach someone to show you respect… Can become hard to resist.
Lambert|I don't. Life's too short.
Geralt|Tell me… You always been such a cynical bastard?
Lambert|No. I was adorable before Vesemir brought me to Kaer Morhen.
Geralt|Think it's that bad being a witcher?
Lambert|Guess I could've been someone worse… Just a shame I had no choice.
Geralt|It was our destiny…
Lambert|Destiny? Let me tell you about destiny.
Lambert|My dad was a drunk. He'd knock a few back, then beat me and Mom bloody. We prayed for his death, every night.
Lambert|One day our prayers were almost answered. Dad lost his way coming home from the tavern, walked smack into a nest of nekkers… But some witcher saved him. Know what he wanted in return?
Lambert|"Give me the first thing you see when you get home." My life… For the life of that prick? I say fuck that kinda destiny.
Geralt|Didn't know… I'm sorry.
Lambert|Next time you wonder why I'm so bitter… well, there's your answer.
Lambert|All right. We've griped enough. Let's get out of here.
Geralt|Need to get our swords. Witcher with no sword's like a man without an arm.
Lambert|Sure thing, brother.
Geralt|Right. Let's get back.
Lambert|After you, sir.
Geralt|You go ahead. Gonna stay here a bit.
Lambert|Mhm. Not too long, though. Remember, got ourselves a cripple to cure.
Geralt|Know what… Let's get outta here.
Lambert|Don't like what you're hearin', huh? Witchers shouldn't talk like that.
Lambert|Know what else you won't like? After the Trial of the Medallion, I rode straight home. To thank my daddy for everything. Wanna hear what I did to him?
Geralt|Lambert… Please.
Lambert|Thought we were opening up, having an honest talk… But fine, let's continue pretending everything's just peachy.
Lambert|The road beckons, my good man! Our companions await!
Geralt|We all went through it…
Lambert|That's just it - not everyone made it. Lots of boys died here. Boys taken against their will.
Geralt|Sense a good story coming…
Lambert|One of the best. A couple of road robbers stopped me - one pointed a crossbow at me and the other started rummaging through my satchel.
Lambert|Made the man with the crossbow shoot his friend… then hang himself.
Geralt|Didn't have to kill them…
Lambert|But I could, so I did. Two whoresons less in the world. Big deal.
Geralt|Wow… truly great story.
Lambert|Isn't it? Real side-splitter, I think.
Geralt|Let's get outta here.
<|endoftext|>
Yennefer|Lambert, prepare the apparatuses. Eskel, go--
Vesemir|Last I heard, my dear, I give the orders around here. Not you.
Yennefer|I believe we made an agreement. To seek to cure Uma my way.
Vesemir|I said we would help you. That's it.
Vesemir|I don't know what you want to do with him - you haven't deigned to inform us. But it's not safe, is it?
Vesemir|Just as I thought. Which is why I think we should first try another, less invasive method.
Geralt|What's this method?
Vesemir|Derives from folk traditions. I've used it many times, in 1211, to lift the curse that held the Swan of Poviss, for instance.
Vesemir|I'll take Uma into the mountains.
Yennefer|What then? Will you howl at the moon together?
Lambert|A bit of respect. You're not talkin' to Geralt.
Vesemir|No, we will not howl at the moon. I'll lay him down on a grave stone. Come midnight, I'll give him tea made of hemlock harvested from… But I don't see that I need to explain this to you.
Yennefer|In my opinion--
Vesemir|I know your opinion. But I'm not asking anyone's permission. I'm saying what will happen. I'll be back at dawn. With Uma… or whoever hides inside him.
Geralt|So… got the evening off. What do we do with it?
Eskel|Vesemir mentioned some roof beams in the tower need replacing. Maybe we could see to that.
Eskel|Or… we could have a drink.
Lambert|Sounds a lot better than the beams.
Geralt|Wouldn't mind a shot myself. Or two.
Eskel|Nothing I can do - been outvoted. Let's go.
Yennefer|Do as you will… But in a moment. Geralt and I must talk.
Eskel|Oo, sounds serious. C'mon, Lambert… See you in a bit Geralt.
Geralt|All right. What did I do this time?
Yennefer|No, nothing. I just wanted to take you aside… without cluing the others into what we're up to.
Geralt|Mhm… And what're we up to?
Yennefer|Sneaking upstairs to make love.
Geralt|Wow, you don't exactly mince words…
Yennefer|I'm too old to play the blushing bride… Unless you ask nicely.
Yennefer|Shall we go? You can rejoin them afterwards. In an hour… or two.
Geralt|Or three…
Yennefer|I'll hold you to that.
Geralt|Yen… Don't get mad, but--
Yennefer|Stop.
Yennefer|Suddenly, I've an immense desire to drink.
Yennefer|I'm still mad at you… I've tension to release.
Geralt|Something not quite right?
Eskel|Geralt gave me a bottle of Mahakaman spirit… That'll hit the spot for me.
Geralt|Vesemir's gotten a bit grumpy in his old age.
Eskel|That was nothing. Shoulda been here last winter when Lambert tried to convince him we oughta abandon Kaer Morhen for good.
Lambert|What good's this old ruin anyway? Moldy walls, leaky roof, and it's one big fucking ice cube in the winter.
Eskel|Vesemir didn't say a word. Stood, grabbed his sword, and slammed the door on his way out. Didn't come back for a month.
Geralt|Don't take this the wrong way, Vesemir, but clock's ticking.
Vesemir|I ask only one night's delay. If nothing comes of it, we'll do what Yennefer wants.
Yennefer|Listen, everyone. All is in place. We may begin.
Geralt|Got you everything you need.
Yennefer|Splendid.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Eventful times for me, recently. Kings, dragons, conspiracies and, then, I found Yen.
Lambert|We're thrilled for you. But why don't you tell us about Uma instead?
Geralt|Pff. Long story. I was on Ciri's trail - went to Velen, Skellige, Novigrad - where Dandelion needed saving again.
Eskel|He get caught ploughing somebody he shouldn't 'ave been?
Lambert|Right. Speaking of old friends, Novigrad and ploughing… How's Triss?
Geralt|Fuck off, Lambert.
Lambert|Whoa! Hit a sore spot, I guess.
Eskel|Lambert. Not funny.
Lambert|Fine. Conversation turned serious? Let's talk. Yen, what do you plan to do with Uma?
Yennefer|I said I'll tell you tomorrow.
Eskel|So tell us now. It's after midnight.
Yennefer|I'll subject him to the Trial of Grasses. But only--
Lambert|You'll fucking what?!
Geralt|Mind your manners, Lambert.
Lambert|Did you hear what--?
Geralt|Not gonna ask you again.
Eskel|Uh, sorry… looking to turn him into a witcher?
Yennefer|Of course not. As I was about to say, I'll only apply the first half of the Trial, because--
Lambert|Because you wanna watch him suffer?
Yennefer|Stop interrupting, or I will watch you suffer.
Yennefer|To restore Uma's former appearance, we must first… Hmm… How do I explain it…
Yennefer|Imagine a lump of clay. In order to shape it, you must first moisten it or it will crumble. The Trial's initial part does just that. It opens the body to change, so to speak. Only then can the mutagens produce a witcher.
Geralt|It'll be the first Trial in years… decades.
Yennefer|I knew you'd be wary.
Lambert|Wary? That's not the problem. Those secrets have been forgotten. And that's how they should stay.
Yennefer|I'd be the last to suggest you start producing hordes of witchers.
Eskel|You hardly need to. See, till now we had a great excuse not to take in apprentices. Seems we'll need to talk it over.
Geralt|Maybe later. Who's up for another round?
Eskel|Oh, I am. But we're all outta stuff to chew on. Geralt, mind raiding the kitchen?
Geralt|Not at all.
Yennefer|Gentlemen, pleasure drinking with you… Lambert especially. But the hour is late.
Yennefer|Don't stay up long. Tomorrow's an important day.
Geralt|What are the chances Uma will survive?
Yennefer|Not great. But we've no choice.
Lambert|Unless Vesemir can do the trick with his hemlock.
Eskel|Might be surprised. Old man knows his stuff.
Geralt|We were talking about Uma, weren't we?
Lambert|The night is young. Got time to talk about everything.
Geralt|Triss is… managing all right.
Lambert|How're those scars she got at Sodden? Still there?
Geralt|What've you been up to, Lambert? On your way west last time I saw you.
Lambert|Uh, yeah. Contract in Lan Exeter. Not to boast, but a pretty lucrative one.
Eskel|Yeah, Kovir's where the gold's to be made. Know how much they pay there for a drowner?
Lambert|Shush, I'm talking now. So this giant was giving 'em trouble. Attacking convoys, dragging folk off into the swamps…
Yennefer|…and relieving himself on the highway, rendering it dreadfully slippery. You've built enough suspense, get to the point.
Lambert|Fine. Turned out it wasn't a giant, just a fat forest troll. And a group of bandits were ambushing the convoys.
Geralt|What did you do?
Lambert|Killed the bandits to keep the roads safe. Then I killed the troll. Needed its, uh, head to collect the bounty.
Geralt|Pragmatic as ever…
Yennefer|You could stand to show some of Lambert's expediency, set ideals like justice for trolls aside, keep yourself out of poverty instead.
Lambert|Knew the sorceress would see it my way.
Geralt|Could've spared the troll…
Lambert|Pff. To eat roots and sleep in roadside ditches? I needed the coin. And not a soul mourned that troll's passing.
Eskel|Let's raise a mug to his memory - the least we can do.
Geralt|What've you been up to, Lambert? Any interesting contracts before you set off in search of Karadin?
Geralt|Where'd you go while you were away, Eskel?
Eskel|Aldersberg. Hunted a higher vampire.
Lambert|Oh-ho-ho… Dangerous whoresons, those.
Eskel|Finicky, too. Specimen in question only went for young women from the upper classes.
Lambert|That's like me.
Yennefer|We've no interest in your fantasies, Lambert. Whereas the vampire… even I'm curious to know how you managed.
Eskel|My client threw a masquerade ball for the city's notables - to lure the vampire out of hiding. I was there, too, disguised. Lemme tell you, never had so much success with the ladies as I did that night.
Geralt|What about the vampire?
Eskel|I'd made a deal with this young alchemist. She really loaded up - fisstech, vodka, magic mushrooms. Went out into the garden, vampire found her and drank his fill. Fight was an afterthought.
Yennefer|Hm… A fairy tale on gluttony for modern times.
Geralt|Alchemist come out of it all right?
Eskel|Fine. Lost a bit of blood, I suppose. Hangover was the worst part. She drank nothing but pickle juice for the next month.
Geralt|Mixing work and romance? Bad idea. Vampire coulda caught you with your pants down.
Eskel|Suppose so. But you look the way I do, you gotta grab every chance you can get.
Lambert|Hahaha, maybe you should wear a mask permanently.
Eskel|Huh! And maybe you should wear a gag.
Geralt|Eskel, that katakan we cut up together - tell us how you nabbed him.
Lambert|A katakan?
Eskel|Uh, Yen, we don't have glasses. You all right drinkin' from a mug?
Yennefer|I'd drink from an old boot tonight.
Yennefer|Urghgh… Perhaps instead of getting crocked in deep glum, we could do some catching up?
Lambert|So? Head Sorceress box your ears again?
Geralt|You could say that.
Lambert|Well, well… Lovebirds decided to join us. Enjoy yourselves?
Eskel|You heard the answer to that question, Lambert… Besides, not our business.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|How about a round of cards?
Lambert|Why not. Playin' for coin, though, right?
Geralt|Yeah… Unless you'd rather play strip gwent.
Lambert|Maybe I'd finally come to understand what women see in you…
Eskel|Compare your trouser snakes later. Pouches on the table!
Lambert|Hahaha!
Eskel|What's with him?
Geralt|Don't worry about it. Let's play.
Geralt|I'd prefer to play for pleasure.
Lambert|Pleasure? You should really talk to Yen about that.
Eskel|Got a one-track mind, Lambert. What are you, twelve?
Geralt|His voice has started cracking. Haven't noticed?
Lambert|Very funny.
Eskel|Very funny!
Geralt|Hahaha!
Geralt|All right, that's enough. Let's play.
Lambert|Can't get enough, can you? Whole castle heard you gettin' pleasured earlier…
Geralt|C'mon… Let's have some fun.
Eskel|We boring you?
Geralt|No, it's just kinda…
Lambert|Slow. Pretty boy's right. Listen… there's this game, student from Oxenfurt taught me.
Geralt|Hm?
Lambert|Someone starts by saying "I've never…" - and finishing the sentence however they want. Whosever done that thing, downs a shot. Then it's the next guy's turn.
Eskel|Sounds great. You start.
Lambert|I've never… slept with a succubus.
Lambert|Expected Geralt might've, but you?
Lambert|Eskel, Eskel… Still waters run deep.
Eskel|I'm a sucker for women with horns.
Eskel|Right, my turn. I've never, after a bender, woken up wearing nothing but my knickers.
Eskel|Geralt? Lambert's a lost cause, but you… What would Papa Vesemir say?
Geralt|Think Papa Vesemir woulda… drank that round, too.
Eskel|All right, Geralt, your turn. I've never…?
Geralt|…Taken fisstech.
Geralt|Eskel… Really?
Eskel|Once… With that succubus.
Geralt|Right, men, let's end on that. Or else I'll never be able to look you in the eyes again.
Lambert|Brrr… Colder'n up an ice giant's ass in here. Gentlemen, I shall return. Gotta go drain the dragon.
Geralt|You and Lambert get along?
Eskel|In a way… I've learned not to talk to him about certain things.
Geralt|Guessing that's quite a list.
Eskel|It is.
Lambert|Hullo, young 'uns! Got your own little carnival going, eh? Alcohol, my good men, is a witcher's worst enemy!
Geralt|Where'd you dig up that bonnet?
Lambert|Vesemir's trunk. The height of fashion in 1112! Old man probably put it on when he went courting! Or, in the jargon of the time, "wooing the damsels."
Lambert|Men, a witcher's life is not all cards and liquor. It is toil, it is labor. No gurgling babes to wean for us, nay, not for us.
Eskel|All right, one Vesemir's enough. Take that off before you get it dirty… And pour.
Lambert|Oh, I'll pour, Eskel, I'll pour. To the brim. 'Cause without vodka, you're as stiff as a bookkeeper in a body cast.
Geralt|So, what's this about a samovila?
Eskel|Snared this peasant in her dance. Instead of bein' happy he escaped with his life, yokel fell head over heels in love.
Eskel|Wanted me to trap her. Turned him down, so he tried it on his own, with a fishing net. Bet you they're still dancing a mazurka in some fallow field.
Lambert|Great story. With a moral, too!
Geralt|Really? What's that?
Lambert|Stay away from dangerous women.
Geralt|You can breathe easy. Yen and I - we're not a couple. And we won't ever be one…
Lambert|Ah, explains why the Sorceress Superior was so damn sulky.
Eskel|Lambert, drop it… Sorry, Geralt, that was, uh, insensitive. We didn't know. You wanna… wanna talk about it?
Geralt|No. I wanna drink.
Lambert|Doable. Definitely doable.
Geralt|Will you ever lay off Yen?
Lambert|Yeah. Soon as I trust her.
Eskel|You'd brave a fire for her… Whereas she plays you like a cheap fiddle. Way it's always been.
Geralt|Listen to you two goddam relationship experts. Neither of you's been with a sorceress…
Eskel|For good reason…
Lambert|Fine, leave pretty boy alone before he gets grumpy. Already has that pouty look on his face. Can't stand it.
Lambert|Drink up, Geralt. To you and Yen - happily ever after!
Geralt|All right, change the subject.
Lambert|Cause you refuse to admit I'm right? Whatever. Fine.
Eskel|Stop being a smart ass and pour.
Geralt|All right, guys… Bed time.
Lambert|Speak for yourself. Night's still young as I see it.
Eskel|Huh, but we're not… And tomorrow's a big day.
Lambert|Fine… Drinkin' with my mirror image is just no fun. Least it wasn't last time.
Geralt|See? Even you can't stand yourself… Good night.
Lambert|Aah… Vodka… vodka's gone. Who's gonna go get some more?
Geralt|Already went… to get food.
Eskel|All right… I'll do it… Kitchen… It's that way, right?
Geralt|Lambert… Bud… Gotta tell you something…
Lambert|Yeah??
Geralt|Sometimes you're… a real jackass… but… I love you, brother…
Lambert|And sometimes you're a real blowhard. But dammit… I'd go to hell and back for you. Come here, you oaf!
Lambert|Damn… broke…
Geralt|Good thing it was empty… Eh… Where's Eskel? Shoulda been back by now. We oughta… look around.
Lambert|This is a job… for Vesemir!
Geralt|Not again… Take that hat off…
Lambert|Where's that whippersnapper wandered off to? He could be… beleaguered… I wager! Come, men, to the rescue!
Geralt|Lambert… Listen… You… You got a problem with me?
Lambert|Me? Why… why would you say that?
Geralt|Well… just seemed that way. And you know… you're a little like my little brother. Dumb and annoying. But a brother.
Lambert|Geralt… dammit! You're gonna make me cry! Come here!
Geralt|Gotta say I'm pretty warm…
Eskel|He's always been a wuss about the cold. Remember winter, fifteen years ago, when the snow stayed around until Belleteyn?
Geralt|Mhm… Lambert sat by the fire, wrapped in a blanket. Cussed copiously every time it started to snow…
Geralt|… jumped out a lover's window.
Eskel|That so… Must've been one tough character whose wife you were ploughing…
Lambert|That wasn't it… He was a friend. Didn't want to hurt his feelings.
Eskel|Yeah, you're a true friend.
Eskel|Oh, Lambert, Lambert… Kaer Morhen's black sheep…
Lambert|Wanna know the best part? They weren't even my knickers!
Geralt|What're you talking about?
Lambert|Samovila contract Eskel got a while back. Good story.
Eskel|Finish it in a minute. First, some more fuel.
Geralt|Ooooh… Now that's a kick in the liver… What is it?
Lambert|"The Gauntlet" - equal parts spirit and White Gull. What's that look about? Yen's gone to bed, time for some serious drinking.
Eskel|Damn straight. Pour us another. Bottoms up!
Lambert|How 'bout that!
Eskel|Good game, Geralt. Especially that move with the--
Lambert|Eskel, he doesn't need any praise. Just pour.
Lambert|Huh. So, Geralt, seems to me you got your ass whooped.
Geralt|Unlucky at cards, lucky in love. And vice versa.
Lambert|Heh. Didn't listen, did he?
Eskel|They never do.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Spilled some wine… and crawled through it.
Lambert|Had to kneel down to see that?
Geralt|If I'd a' bent over, I'd 'ave puked…
Lambert|Eskel! Eskeeeeeel!
Geralt|Eeeeskeeeeeel!
Geralt|Think he… think he hurt himself.
Lambert|What's one scar more or less in his case? Makes no difference, as I see it.
Lambert|Hey… Hic! Hear that?
Geralt|Sounded like… panting… of a wounded wyvern…
Lambert|Dammit… We missed a fight!
Geralt|Aha… Eskel's close…
Lambert|Hang in there, brother! We're coming!
Geralt|Eskel! Chop chop!
Lambert|Eskel, you drunk! Get out here!
<|endoftext|>
Lambert|Hellooo, Eskel! Wake up!
Eskel|Hm? What? What happened?
Lambert|Got sloshed, stewed and fifty-seven other varieties of drunk - that's what happened. Get up, time to have a drink.
Eskel|Le' me alone… Gonna puke… The three of us get together, always ends like this…
Lambert|Let's find a fourth! Better! A woman!
Geralt|None here but Yen… And we don't wanna wake her up. Believe me.
Lambert|What about that sorceress you talked to? Think about it. We turn on the megascope, cordially invite her… she teleports here… maybe brings some friends! How's that sound?
Geralt|Lambert… You're a genius!
Lambert|Course I am! So? We inviting the Lodge to our bash?
Eskel|Fuck yeah! Summon the bitches!
Geralt|Lambert… Believe you've had your last drink.
Lambert|You're just jealous you didn't think of it first… But is that any reason to spoil it for us?
Geralt|I don't have the strength to argue.
Lambert|Course you don't, cream puff. Bet I could take you with one finger.
Eskel|Hey… Relax, Lambert…
Lambert|Wanna fight? Huh? Wanna? C'mon!
Geralt|Good night.
Geralt|Heeeey… Look… Here he is!
Lambert|With his ever faithful Lil' Bleater!
<|endoftext|>
Eskel|All right… how's this work?
Geralt|Well… A twist here, a turn there… Then you gotta say something in Elvish.
Lambert|Easy-peasy. Let's do it.
Eskel|Hey. Hang on. When this… Ida sees us… we'll scare her off. I mean, we don't look anything like sorceresseswes…
Lambert|I know! Yennefer's clothes! Let's dress up. Bags're over there.
Eskel|What's this thing you got for dressing up?
Lambert|Shut it, wiseass, or I'll lace your corset up so tight you'll shit in your bloomers.
Geralt|Stop whining, Eskel. Times you gotta squeeze into some fr-fr-fr….
Lambert|Frippery.
Eskel|Uuugh… We don't tell a soul, understand? This stays here.
Geralt|Don't really like the idea, either…
Lambert|Fine… But if this Ida refuses to talk to us, it'll be your fault.
Hemmelfart|No, you oaf! Witchers! Witchers attacking!
Eskel|Hahahahaha!
Lambert|Hahhahaha!
Yennefer|I trust you have an explanation for this. A very good one.
Yennefer|Go to bed. Now.
Geralt|Now… I'll do the talking, you two fiddle with the crystals.
Geralt|Cáed'mil, bloede dh'oine… Hocus-pocus… Abracadabra… Arse blathanna…
Hemmelfart|What is this…? Who's that?
Geralt|So sorry… We were never here.
Hemmelfart|Guaaaaards!!!
Eternal Fire Guard 01|More paper, Excellency?
Hemmelfart|No, you oaf! The Lodge! The Lodge has come for me!
Lambert|Damn, Eskel… You got an hourglass figure…
Eskel|And you're an ass. C'mon, go, thing's tight as hell.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|See everyone's up and at 'em.
Vesemir|Mhm. Take it you had a productive evening?
Eskel|Yes. We talked about Uma. Till late.
Vesemir|So I guess you didn't get a chance to see to the beams in the tower?
Eskel|Uh… No… But we'll, uh, get to that, I promise. Right, Lambert?
Yennefer|You can give the boys a rap on their knuckles later. Let's get to work.
Geralt|Vesemir, learn anything?
Vesemir|While you were out hunting forktails and playing with the megascope, I examined Uma. Noticed one thing - at moments of, what's the term… relaxed consciousness, he behaves differently.
Vesemir|While falling asleep, he'd pause awake for an instant. Something different about his movements, his gaze, then. But only for a moment.
Vesemir|So I induced a trance, hypnotized him, essentially. No effect at first, but as he dropped into deep lethargy, I heard something… a sigh or a moan. And it wasn't Uma's voice.
Lambert|All right. I just don't get how that helps us.
Yennefer|Then keep silent. Thank you, Vesemir… And… I apologize for what I said earlier. Have the boys told you what we plan to do?
Vesemir|Yes. Don't like it one bit. But I suppose I have to trust you.
Geralt|Right, so what now?
Yennefer|We can begin. We need only brew the potions.
Lambert|Wait. Why couldn't we--
Yennefer|Do it earlier? Because the preparatory potions for the Trial are strongly reactive. They must be administered immediately after they're brewed. Satisfied?
Yennefer|Geralt, make the potions. Here are the formulae. Eskel, take a bottle of spirit…
Eskel|Oh no. After last night, I--
Yennefer|…and disinfect the tools. Well? Chop-chop!
Geralt|Thought we got rid of that table ages ago.
Eskel|Huh. Must be fifty years since I last saw Sad Albert.
Vesemir|Couldn't bear to part with it. Thought we might find a use for it one day. You know how old people are.
Lambert|Sure. Every grandpa out there's got an attic full of torture devices.
Geralt|Guess your gravestone and hemlock method didn't work…
Vesemir|Not entirely. But I did learn something.
Vesemir|Mhm. And reeking of booze.
Vesemir|That hat was a memento, Lambert.
Lambert|Relax, old man. It'll come out in the wash.
Geralt|Damn… What a dream.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Potions ready.
Eskel|Tools, too.
Yennefer|Good. Vesemir…
Vesemir|Hookweed extract to deaden the pain. I know. Done this before.
Yennefer|Eskel, make the incisions in his veins, insert the tubes. Geralt, place the potion vials in the feeders.
Ugliest Man Alive|Umauma!
Geralt|Ready.
Yennefer|Open the valves. It doesn't matter in which order.
Ugliest Man Alive|Aaaach… Aaaaaach!
Ugliest Man Alive|Aaaa…. Aaaa…. Ummmmmmamamamaaaaa…
Geralt|The hookweed work?
Vesemir|If it hadn't, the pain would've sent him into shock, killed him.
Lambert|So, everything's going smoothly.
Vesemir|No… But it's within known norms.
Yennefer|Administer the next potion.
Ugliest Man Alive|Ummmmmmamama… UUUuuu… Umamama….
Vesemir|I had hoped… I'd hoped I would never have to watch this again.
Lambert|Why'd you keep the table, then?
Yennefer|Geralt. Next potion.
Ugliest Man Alive|Ummmmamamamama… AAaaaaaa….. AAAAaaaach!
Yennefer|Oesi, caefyn!
Geralt|What now?
Vesemir|Now we wait for the potions to do their work. Might take a day. Might take more.
Yennefer|You need only wait, true. But I must maintain the stabilizing spell. Uma's body is not nearly as resilient as a young candidate witcher's. Without this he'd--
Ugliest Man Alive|Bueeeeergh…
Yennefer|Eskel, I'm sorry… Would you mind…?
Eskel|Getting some rags? On it.
Ugliest Man Alive|Aaaa… Aaaaach! Aaaaaaa!!!
Ugliest Man Alive|Yyyyyyyyyyyaaaaaa!!!
Geralt|Listen… We should stop this.
Yennefer|Then Uma dies. Very painfully.
Vesemir|Yennefer's right.
Yennefer|Open the next valve.
Yennefer|Geralt… I'm sorry, could you…?
Geralt|Clean that up? Of course.
<|endoftext|>
Eskel|Ugh. I can't believe we're doing this.
Geralt|Wiping vomit off the floor?
Eskel|No. The Trial.
Eskel|If that's Ciri in there… she could come outta this crippled, wrong in the head, just emotionless. Thought about that?
Geralt|I trust Yen. She knows what she's doing.
Eskel|Don't doubt that. But do we know what she's doing? She tell you how likely this is to work?
Yennefer|Gentlemen, the floor's as clean as it'll ever be, and I need to be wiped down as well.
Eskel|Geralt… Maybe you oughta…?
Yennefer|Come now, Eskel. I shan't bite you. Just do it.
Ugliest Man Alive|Ummmma…
Geralt|That normal?
Yennefer|Yes. Uma's body is disintegrating from the inside. Once that's complete, we'll need to reform it… or he'll die.
Yennefer|You witchers were given mutagens. We will use spells.
Lambert|Brought some food.
Yennefer|Good, I'm famished. Would…?
Yennefer|Vesemir, would you mind preparing something for me?
Vesemir|Something, sure… Just don't expect pate and crumpets… More likely to get bean and tomato stew… Or--
Yennefer|Whatever. So long as it's warm. And there's a lot of it.
Yennefer|Good, I'm famished… Geralt… I cannot leave his side… Would you prepare me something?
Geralt|All right. Anything in particular strike your fancy?
Yennefer|Something light. Scrambled eggs, perhaps? Or an omelet if you wish to spoil me. With onions, mushrooms and peppers.
Yennefer|Thanks.
Geralt|I'm not great with food…
Yennefer|I know that all too well. When we lived in Aedd Gynvael, you tried to make soft-boiled eggs once. Forgot to add water.
Geralt|Got lost in thought…
Yennefer|More like distracted. By me.
Yennefer|The good old days, you might say… Ah, but no matter. I'm hungry. So much so that I care not a lick for how poorly you cook.
Geralt|Mhm… Still got that nightdress?
Yennefer|Geralt… We've drifted off the topic at hand. I'm hungry. So hungry I don't care how badly you cook.
Yennefer|No offense, but I'd rather Geralt did it.
Eskel|Understood. I'd prefer that, too.
Geralt|Course I have. Thing is, we don't have a choice.
Eskel|Not any more, we don't. But… we rushed it. Should've started by--
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Can't be any harder than brewing a potion…
Geralt|All right, let's get to work.
Geralt|A bit of this, a bit of that, mix it all together…
Geralt|Hmm… No eggs…
Geralt|Ugh… I can't serve this to Yen…
Geralt|Edible… I think.
Geralt|This is a disaster…
Geralt|Don't have any onion…
Geralt|Scrambled eggs, it's gotta be.
Geralt|No peppers…
Geralt|No mushrooms.
Geralt|An omelet, no denying that.
Geralt|Might've added too many ingredients...
Geralt|Wouldn't serve this to a dog.
Geralt|Edible, I think…
Geralt|Argh. Gotta start over. Need some more ingredients.
Geralt|An eggless omelet… Doubt that'll pass muster.
Geralt|Hmm… Not so sure about this…
Geralt|Need to add anything else?
<|endoftext|>
Yennefer|Oh, decided to put in the effort… Thank you.
Geralt|I get a gratuity for that?
Yennefer|Later, perhaps…
Ugliest Man Alive|Umm…. Umma… Umma…
Geralt|What's wrong with him?
Yennefer|A fever. I'll break it with a spell.
Vesemir|A cold compress should do the trick. I'll take care of it. You eat.
Yennefer|Thanks. Geralt…? I'm waiting.
Geralt|So, uh… do I… spoon-feed you?
Yennefer|Would you prefer to watch me eat without my hands? You could find it amusing, I suppose.
Geralt|Right… One for papa Vesemir…
Geralt|Everyone's at your beck and call. Got me cooking for you, turned Vesemir into your errand boy…
Yennefer|I'd gladly trade places with any of you. If you think--
Geralt|Relax. I was kidding.
Yennefer|Geralt… I'm exhausted, hungry and upset. In other words, please let's leave the laughter for later.
Yennefer|Scrambled eggs, after all.
Geralt|Sorry… didn't feel up to any real cooking.
Yennefer|What… What is this?
Geralt|My own original recipe… It ain't prety, but it's edible. I think.
Yennefer|Not quite what I asked for… But it looks appetizing enough.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Hey… Yen… You're dozing off.
Yennefer|No. Just… resting my eyes.
Geralt|Yeah, it's called sleeping.
Yennefer|Then do something to keep me awake.
Yennefer|I don't know… Tell me a story.
Geralt|Heard about the time Ciri and I went ice skating?
Yennefer|No… Not that I recall.
Geralt|The winter she trained here. Couple months in, she started complaining I was too harsh a teacher. Brushed it off at first.
Geralt|Then she asked me to go skating with her. Didn't really want to, I'd never been before… But she insisted.
Geralt|Soon as we hit the ice, she started skating circles around me, hollering "No, not like that! Footwork! One, then the other!" "Crossover! No! Wrong!" "Brake with the heel of your skate!, not the toes!" Needless to say, from then on--
Ugliest Man Alive|Uuuuma…?
Yennefer|He's awake. It's time… time to lift the curse. Prepare the phylactery.
Geralt|Ever tell you about the time Dandelion bought me a sword?
Yennefer|Was that in Kerack? Just after we'd…
Geralt|Decided to take a break. Yeah. My swords had… disappeared, doesn't matter how. And Dandelion insisted I had to be armed. Decided he'd buy me a weapon.
Geralt|Came to me, beaming. "The truest Viroledan steel! Good price, too, so good it felt like I was stealing!"
Geralt|Naturally, blade shattered first parry I threw.
Geralt|Pinching's apparently effective.
Yennefer|Mh. Later perhaps. For now, talk to me. Tell me a story.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Avallac'h…?
Vesemir|You know him?
Geralt|Yes. An elf, Aen Elle. A Sage…
Yennefer|Where is Ciri?
Avallach|Hidden… the Isle of Mists… But… it's not… she's not safe… The Hunt…
Geralt|Isle of Mists - where is it?
Avallach|Everywhere… and nowhere…
Lambert|Listen, Sage. We didn't lift that curse to play riddles with you.
Avallach|Praevein, arwein, cyrraen…
Avallach|In Skellige… Follow it… Into the mists. Hurry… Hurry!
Avallach|I tried to protect her… But the curse…
Avallach|The Hunt has not found the Isle… As yet… 'Tis a matter of time. But if she leaves… They will detect her… At once…
Yennefer|Enough, Geralt. He's not yet free of death's grip.
Geralt|I'm going to get Ciri.
Eskel|Hold up. Don't you think you owe us some answers? How do you know this Avallac'h? What's Ciri been doing with him?
Geralt|Yennefer can tell you, just keep an eye on him. He's not a friend.
Vesemir|Perhaps not, but Ciri apparently trusted him. We should at least take his words seriously.
Vesemir|You heard what he said - take Ciri from that Isle of Mists and the Hunt'll pick up her trail immediately. What then?
Geralt|What's your suggestion?
Vesemir|Ciri can't flee forever. One day she'll stumble. And she won't get a second chance.
Vesemir|Time we the hunted became the hunters. Geralt will find Ciri and bring her here… and the Hunt will follow.
Vesemir|They'll expect to catch us by surprise - and they'll be sorely disappointed.
Yennefer|We plan to fight them? We five? In a crumbling castle?
Vesemir|Do we have a choice? Besides delaying the inevitable?
Lambert|Pretty boy could try to round up a few others who know how to swing a sword…
Yennefer|… or wield magic.
Geralt|Fine. I'll get Ciri, and recruit some allies. Bring everyone here. Got a few favors I can call in.
Lambert|Any good looking women in that batch?
Geralt|Mhm. Exclusively.
Geralt|All right. Time I was on my way.
Vesemir|Good luck, Wolf. And give Cirilla our love.
Yennefer|Come back quickly, Geralt.
Geralt|And you? What do you plan to do?
Yennefer|I've Avallac'h to care for. He's certain to die without gentle, gradual magic treatment. There's hope if I help him. Not much, but better than naught.
Vesemir|The boys and I'll consider how we should greet our uninvited guests.
Geralt|I dunno. Guess we'll see.
Vesemir|Geralt, you're in a hurry to get her, I understand. But you-- We can't act blindly.
Lambert|You got something in mind, don't you. Come on, spit it out.
Geralt|We'll be waiting for them. Swords in hand.
Vesemir|Yes…
Geralt|Is he gonna make it?
Yennefer|I can't… know. You saw. Not all went as planned. I lifted the curse, but…
Vesemir|The Trial has wrought havoc in his body.
Vesemir|Violently twitching fingers, pupils that don't react to the light… Seen it many times before. Too many.
Yennefer|Toxins have permanently damaged his nervous system. Even if he does pull through… Do you understand?
Geralt|The Hunt - what's it want from Ciri?
Avallach|Her blood… Elder Blood… to open the gate.
Avallach|We cannot… we cannot allow this.
Yennefer|Nevid, cyvir!
Yennefer|Caniatad… Nevid… Cyvir…
Yennefer|Coalle… Ariva… Aendir…
Yennefer|No… no, I won't let you!
Yennefer|Geralt! Yellow flask! In my satchel!
Vesemir|Quiet. Listen.
Avallach|Coalle… Coalle… Caniatad…
Yennefer|Nevid, cyvir! Coalle, coalle caniatad!
Yennefer|Nevid! Ariva! Aendir!
Yennefer|Geralt! The phylactery! Open it!
Yennefer|Caniatad! Taron Anede! Dis!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Got a delicate matter I wanted to bring up. Need your help.
Cerys|What is it?
Geralt|Crach's mentioned Ciri to you - he must've.
Cerys|Have you found her?!
Geralt|Not yet, but I'm close. Problem is, soon as I get to her, the Wild Hunt'll probably be able to locate us… quickly. So I'll want to take her to Kaer Morhen. Battle the Hunt there.
Geralt|I'm looking for allies.
Cerys|You can count on me, Geralt. Soon as the race for the crown's settled.
Geralt|I understand.
Cerys|Hmm… I can't leave the Isles now, it's impossible. What I can do is give you my best warrior.
Cerys|Hjalmar.
Geralt|Think he'll be willing?
Cerys|I'm sure of it… In fact, I think he'll be overjoyed! Come on, you know him.
Geralt|Yeah, guess I do. Thanks.
Cerys|No doubt he’ll be valiant. I hope proves useful, too. Good luck.
Cerys|I can't go… but do forgive me. Hjalmar's given me tasks, important ones. He's my king, now - I can't just abandon him.
Geralt|I understand. I should go - gotta keep looking.
Cerys|Good luck, Geralt.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|This isn't easy, but I need to ask you a favor. A big one.
Crach|Tell me, friend.
Geralt|Ciri - I know where she is. But I also know that as soon as I reach her, the Wild Hunt will know I did.
Geralt|They'll come after us, attack, and we'll need to respond with strength. Can I count on you?
Crach|The Black Ones first, now wraiths… Such is life. Bring her here, and we'll face them in battle!
Geralt|Can't risk your men's lives. Kaer Morhen - we fight them there, nowhere else.
Crach|Kaer Morhen is hundreds of miles away. To move an army there would take weeks, not to mention I'd expose the Isles to Nilfgaard's blows…
Crach|Geralt, forgive me, but I cannot do it.
Geralt|I understand… Won't take up any more of your time. Farewell.
Crach|Wait.
Crach|Won't let you leave empty-handed. I'll help as I can. Come with me.
Geralt|What's this about the Nilfgaardians?
Crach|But fear not, we'll banish the Black Ones and the Wild Hunt. Two birds with one Skelligan axe, heh heh.
Crach|Ciri will be safe in Kaer Trolde.
Geralt|Beautiful craftsmanship. Got a talented smith.
Crach|Not I. King Erlend an Craite did.
Geralt|Erlend Stonefist? So this is… Winter's Blade? Thought it was a legend…
Crach|Forged in Mahakam, tempered in dragon fire… Been in the an Craite family for centuries.
Crach|And now it's yours.
Geralt|Thank you… This can't be easy for you. I appreciate it all the more.
Crach|May it serve you well. Send those specters back where they came from.
Geralt|That's my intention. Farewell.
Geralt|I can't take this.
Crach|You can, you must. Let me do this much, at least.
Geralt|If you insist… Thank you.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Wasn't sure I should even ask you. Still not. But what the hell - I could honestly use some help.
Dijkstra|Ooh, my help? Very interesting. Do tell.
Geralt|Wild Hunt's gonna attack Kaer Morhen soon. It's a sure thing. Looking for people, resources, anything that'll help me repel them.
Dijkstra|The Wild Hunt? Don't tell me you believe that nonsense.
Geralt|Hardly nonsense. Got a taste of it, a painful taste, on my own skin.
Dijkstra|Hmm… sorry, Geralt, but I've me own pile of problems just now. I've not recovered my lost property. Your help, you might remember, left much to be desired.
Dijkstra|So I don't owe you shit.
Dijkstra|Hmm… I'm about as good of a warrior as you are a dancing girl. And Kaer Morhen's beyond my sphere of influence…
Dijkstra|On the other hand, I'd not 'ave recovered my pile if not for you…
Dijkstra|Listen, here's what we'll do: I'll give you a fat purse, meh, a bit on top - and we'll call it even. Agreed?
Geralt|Agreed. Thanks.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Your Imperial Majesty.
Emhyr|Witcher. Why have you come?
Geralt|I've managed to find out where Ciri is.
Emhyr|Finally. I had begun to doubt the wisdom of enlisting you. Bring her here at once.
Geralt|The Wild Hunt's pursuing her. Kaer Morhen's the only place she'll be safe.
Emhyr|That was not a suggestion. I can defend my own daughter.
Geralt|I don't doubt it - against conventional foes. The Wild Hunt's different.
Geralt|Facing it here would put Vizima at risk. Hundreds of innocents could die.
Geralt|Kaer Morhen is in a wilderness. And your army stands to be far more helpful there.
Emhyr|Hmm… Agreed. I shall send a banner with you. On one condition - General Voorhis will lead it.
Geralt|Can't agree to that.
Emhyr|And I cannot agree to witchers commanding my troops.
Geralt|Well, I'm not about to give in - you don't look it, either.
Geralt|Sorry to take up your time, Your Majesty.
Emhyr|Bring me Ciri.
Geralt|I will. If that's what she wants.
Geralt|I doubt that. Can't compare the Wild Hunt to Temerian shield bearers or Lyrian archers.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Could use your help at Kaer Morhen. Aim to take Ciri there. Wild Hunt's bound to appear soon after.
Roche|Geralt, we've known each other for a while. You know I'd never turn you down normally.
Roche|But right now I've some troubles - a hideout that is no more, a weapons shipment that failed to make its destination, and Ves drilling a hole in my gut.
Roche|I'll go nowhere until I resolve at least the last.
Roche|You didn't turn your back on me when I was in need. It's only fair I do the same.
Geralt|Thanks. Venture to say your skills might prove invaluable.
Roche|I'll consider whether to bring Ves. Either way, I'll see you at Kaer Morhen.
Roche|Forgive me, Geralt, but I can't. Not after losing Ves.
Roche|I've no one left who could stand in for me here, yet we've still got a war to win.
Geralt|I understand, Roche. Good luck to you.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Finally know where Ciri is.
Triss|Really? That's... wonderful!
Triss|Wait, why haven't you brought her here? Is she in danger?
Geralt|Guessed it. As soon as I reach her, the Wild Hunt'll know.
Geralt|I need you to go to Kaer Morhen. As soon as I have Ciri, I'll take here there - we'll face the Hunt together.
Triss|Geralt… You know I'd do anything for Ciri… But we'll need to evacuate the mages from the city any day now.
Triss|They're counting on me, I can't leave them.
Geralt|I understand…
Triss|Maybe we can make this work. If you helped me, we'd speed things up, considerably… Think about it and let me know.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Locked…
Geralt|Anybody in there?
Geralt|Damn…
Dwarf Sneezy|Achoo!
Geralt|I'm not gonna hurt you. Open up.
Dwarf Doc|Ach! Ye blew our fuckin' cover.
Dwarf Grumpy|Who are ye and whaddaya want?
Geralt|I'm Geralt, a witcher.
Dwarf Grumpy|Argh. Go away!
Geralt|Looking for a young woman - ashen hair, scar on her face. Will you let me in?
Dwarf Sneezy|No!
Geralt|Running short on patience.
Dwarf Grumpy|Wonderful. Means you're about to go the fuck away.
Dwarf Doc|By me mum's beard, get yourselves together, lads.
Dwarf Doc|You, there! Outside the door! Geralt - that right?!
Geralt|Yeah. Geralt.
Dwarf Doc|Listen, Geralt. Let's cut to the thick of it.
Dwarf Doc|We survived a shipwreck - recently. Beasts from the depths ate some of my lads, and the rest of us found shelter here.
Dwarf Doc|Not too special, that, as dangers litter this isle. But it does go to explain why we're a wee bit distrustful.
Geralt|Got nothing to fear from me…
Dwarf Grumpy|…Said the fox to the gaggle o' geese.
Dwarf Doc|I've lost too many mates already. I won't risk it, I can't.
Geralt|Say I find your mates, will you believe I mean no harm?
Dwarf Doc|Aye, but I'd not count on either comin' too easy…
Geralt|How many are there?
Dwarf Bashful|Three: Ivo, Gaspard and Ferenc.
Geralt|All right. See if I can't find all three. See ya.
Dwarf Doc|I'm content ye understand.
Geralt|This Ivo… Where do I look??
Dwarf Doc|Idgit insisted he'd explore the caves to the east.
Dwarf Doc|Tried to knock it out his head - literally! Bugger wouldn't budge.
Geralt|Gaspard - where'll I find him?
Dwarf Doc|He said it was defeatist to sit and wait to be rescued. We had to take action, or at least he did.
Dwarf Doc|Claimed to have spotted a lantern out to sea, so he said he'd climb the highest peak to look out for ships.
Geralt|Where'd Ferenc go?
Dwarf Doc|West. In search of a ship that's said to be out there.
Dwarf Bashful|Ferenc, he's, uh, handy. Thought he might fix it up, make it seaworthy.
Geralt|Open the door, or I'll open it myself.
Dwarf Grumpy|You try! These hinges, this lock - they'll withstand anythin'! 'Course, you could always come back with a platoon o' engineers, a batterin' ram and a Mahakaman locksmith.
Dwarf Doc|Why the threats?! We's all in one cart! We'd do better to help each other than argue.
Geralt|All right. What do you want?
Dwarf Doc|I want you to find our mates - Ivo, Ferenc and Gaspard. They ventured off, but they're on the isle, missin' and probably lost.
Dwarf Doc|Help 'em, help me. Please. If anyone can find 'em, I know you can.
Geralt|This conversation's getting tiring. Listen, let's make a deal.
Dwarf Bashful|If that's a demon, it'll try to dupe us now.
Geralt|I'm not a demon. You don't need to fear me. Gimme a chance, I'll prove it.
Dwarf Grumpy|How ye aim to do that?
Geralt|No way you can get to this isle conventionally.
Dwarf Grumpy|Crikey. Ye call a shipwreck conventional?
Dwarf Doc|Leave it be, mate. Ye know what he means.
Dwarf Sneezy|Achoo! Achoo! Let me explain. A short while past we was en route from Skellige to Novigrad.
Dwarf Sneezy|And Ferenc got talkin' with the captain, who sold 'im a magic firefly purported to know the way to a hidden treasure.
Geralt|How many of you are in there?
Dwarf Grumpy|Why d'ye need to know? Ye takin' a bloody census?
Geralt|They call me Geralt. Who are you?
Dwarf Bashful|Ah! It's that witcher! I heard a ballad about this 'un and that sorceress - what's her name…?
Dwarf Grumpy|Shut it!
Geralt|Yennefer. Sorceress' name is Yennefer of Vengerberg.
Dwarf Bashful|Aye, that's it! "Her eyes flashin' lightnin', her heart an icy berg…" Errm… how did it go?
<|endoftext|>
Dwarf Man 01|A man! Hah! Am I ever pleased to see you!
Geralt|Come down!
Dwarf Man 01|Right! I'm comin'!
Dwarf Man 01|You lucky devil, you.
Dwarf Man 01|You know, I've one regret - that--
Dwarf Man 01|Aaaargh!
Geralt|Dead.
Geralt|Damn.
Geralt|I talked to your friends! Come down!
Dwarf Man 01|I'm here! Up here!
Dwarf Man 01|Hear me?! Up here!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Hey, wake up.
Dwarf Sleepy|Shoo… Back to bed, Nibbles.
Geralt|Wake up!
Dwarf Sleepy|Wha-- What's happenin'?
Dwarf Sleepy|Who-- Who're you?
Geralt|I'm Geralt.
Geralt|Your friends asked me to find you, Ferenc and Ivo.
Dwarf Sleepy|I'm afeared they're dead. Some horrors swarmed Ivo, saw it with my own eyes. And Ferenc… I heard him - a blood-curdling cry, then the roar of a beast.
Geralt|Let's get back to the hut. I'll protect you along the way.
Dwarf Sleepy|Shame about the lads, really, but what can ye do…? Come on.
Dwarf Sleepy|But, I should warn you, I suffer from narcolepsy, meaning-- Oah…
Geralt|I know what it means. Don't worry, I'll keep you awake.
Dwarf Sleepy|Off we go, then.
Geralt|You and your friends - what's your story?
Dwarf Sleepy|Rabenick and Company. Real estate appraisal, insurance, mass event organization.
Dwarf Sleepy|Gaspard Sutter - my mates call me Sleepy.
Dwarf Sleepy|I even slept through that storm.
Dwarf Sleepy|It's a shame so many died…
Geralt|Any chance you've seen an ashen-haired woman around here?
Dwarf Sleepy|Here? Nay, not a soul.
Dwarf Sleepy|But… a lot passes me by on account of my sleepin'.
Geralt|Wanna explore the island a bit. Come back for you after, take you to your friends. Unless you care to come with me now?
Dwarf Sleepy|I'd only be a burden. You know, the narcolepsy…
Dwarf Sleepy|This place seems safe enough. Just be sure and come back. And make it quick, eh? Not that much to see here.
Dwarf Sleepy|What now?
<|endoftext|>
Dwarf Sleepy|Begone… Begone, vile power.
Dwarf Sleepy|Heehee, a fetlock in the arse…
Dwarf Sleepy|Heehee. Stop your scamperin', you tease.
Dwarf Sleepy|Driftin' off! I'll soon snnnneeeerrr…
Dwarf Sleepy|Aaaahh… It's stronger than me, so sorrrrrrry… Zzzzzz…
Dwarf Sleepy|Fle-fyelin' a wee bit drowsyyy…
Geralt|Wake up.
Dwarf Sleepy|Neh! I don't - I don't wanna go to school.
Geralt|Wake up.
Dwarf Sleepy|Right, right… just a wee bit longer…
Geralt|Get up.
Geralt|C'mon, get up.
Dwarf Sleepy|Oh, Nibbles, yousa naughty kitty, aren't ye?
Dwarf Sleepy|All right! I'm up!
Geralt|Wake up.
Dwarf Sleepy|Deh! I'm awake, wide awake.
Geralt|C'mon, keep moving.
Dwarf Sleepy|Know much about this isle?
Geralt|Almost nothing.
Dwarf Sleepy|Ye know it ain't on my map.
Geralt|A common characteristic of enchanted islands.
Dwarf Sleepy|Ye think it enchanted?
Geralt|It's the one thing I'm sure of.
Dwarf Sleepy|So what is it brought you to this strange place?
Geralt|Looking for someone.
Dwarf Sleepy|Here?
Geralt|Mhm. Just kind of turned out that way.
Dwarf Sleepy|Not too keen on talkin' about it, are ye.
Geralt|Not really.
<|endoftext|>
Dwarf Doc|Gaspard! Hah! You seem a bit muddled.
Dwarf Sleepy|Beh, err, muddled. A bit drowsy, that's all.
Dwarf Doc|What of the others?
Geralt|Couldn't find anyone else. Gaspard claims they're dead.
Dwarf Grumpy|Argh. Everything's gone wrong. What'll we do now?
Geralt|Got a boat, you can leave with me. But I need to find someone first.
Dwarf Bashful|An ashen-haired lass?
Geralt|Yes.
Dwarf Bashful|Oh - dreadful sorry.
Geralt|Step aside.
Dwarf Doc|She's cold, spirit's left her. Nothin' we could do.
Dwarf Grumpy|Let's wait by the boat.
Geralt|What do you mean?
Dwarf Bashful|She's cold. Spirit's left her.
Dwarf Doc|Must've passed shortly before we found her.
Dwarf Bashful|Let's wait by the boat.
Geralt|Saw another fall from a cliff. Broke his neck.
Dwarf Doc|Shit. Rabenick told me to have an eye on the snot. 'Twas his nephew.
Dwarf Doc|Thanks for helpin'. And, uh, sorry I didn't trust ye.
Geralt|Found one near a monster's den. He was already dead, sadly.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|We lifted the curse. He's at Kaer Morhen, waiting for you.
Cirilla|Are you serious? You must be. You'd not jest about something like that… Hah! A nice thing to wake up to.
Geralt|You trust him?
Cirilla|Avallac'h? He's not let me down to date. Not once.
Geralt|How'd you ever start traveling with Avallac'h?
Cirilla|As soon as I'd left you and Yen on the Isle of Avalon, I found myself pursued. Eredin and his Red Riders were on my heels.
Cirilla|I fled through many worlds, many times… They came very close to catching me, once. It was then that Avallac'h appeared, out of nowhere.
Cirilla|He found a portal and took us to a world where Eredin couldn't find us for… oh, perhaps half a year.
Geralt|So why'd you return?
Cirilla|I thought the Hunt had lost my scent for good. I thought I was safe.
Cirilla|Besides, I… I wanted to find you, you and Yennefer.
Geralt|You were looking for us, we were looking for you… Times I thought you were just a step away. Other times, felt like I was going around in circles…
Cirilla|I'm not surprised. There were times I fled pell-mell head first and forward.
Geralt|So tell me how it happened. Step by step.
Cirilla|Eredin located us mere moments after we landed on Ard Skellig. Soon after, he and his riders surrounded us. I thought it was over, the end.
Cirilla|Turned out Eredin had other plans. He produced the phylactery, uncorked it. A fog enveloped us, and Avallac'h began gasping for air.
Geralt|That's how Eredin cursed Avallac'h, triggered his transformation into Uma?
Cirilla|Yes. He didn't wish to kill him. Humiliation, that's what he was after. But Avallac'h refused to succumb without a fight. He cast a spell that wrought havoc in the Hunt's ranks.
Geralt|And in a full half of a forest on Ard Skellig.
Cirilla|Yet it also gave us time to flee. Avallac'h opened a portal, I leapt in. He was supposed to follow, right behind me, but something went awry. Impaired by the curse, he failed to reach the portal in time.
Cirilla|We had agreed that if anything went wrong and we were separated, we would meet at his hideout in Velen.
Geralt|But you failed to meet there…
Cirilla|Yes, we failed to. Once through the portal, instead of at Avallac'h's hideout, I landed right in the middle of Crookback Bog.
Cirilla|I barely escaped the Crones. And then there was the baron.
Cirilla|You know he took me hunting? I killed a wild boar with my sword.
Geralt|I heard.
Cirilla|A coincidence, really. I had no desire to hunt that day, but it felt wrong to refuse.
Cirilla|I'd taken nothing remotely resembling a hunting weapon. I simply hadn't intended to hunt.
Cirilla|I was wandering through the forest, breathing deep the air, and then I heard a strange sound, unsettling.
Geralt|Boar attacked you?
Cirilla|Mhm. Big as a bison and lumbering straight at me. And all I had was my sword. Had to manage.
Geralt|Did just fine judging by how the baron's men remember it.
Cirilla|Simple soldiers, the whole lot, but we got along splendidly. A shame I had to leave, flee, but I didn't want to bring the Wild Hunt down on them.
Cirilla|Apart from which, I knew by then the curse was progressing, so instead of looking for Avallac'h, I decided to find you and Yen.
Geralt|So how'd you even meet a man like Whoreson Junior?
Cirilla|You and Yennefer were nowhere to be found. And I needed someone who could fix the phylactery.
Cirilla|No ordinary craftsman would do. I needed a mage, one with extraordinary powers.
Cirilla|Dandelion took it upon himself to help me. It was as if his honor depended on it. He arranged a meeting with a mage, but it proved a trap set by the Temple Guard.
Geralt|Hm, failed to mention that.
Cirilla|Eh, probably didn't want to worry you. Later we learned the Guard did that sort of thing regularly, in the hope of nabbing anyone who collaborated with mages.
Cirilla|We needed to find another way. That was clear.
Cirilla|Then Dandelion said he knew a man who owned a piece of Novigrad, as he put it, could do more than others. He was certain to know someone who could fix the phylactery.
Geralt|Whoreson Junior.
Cirilla|Mhm. I suspected it might not be the best idea, but I was desperate, had no choice.
Geralt|You suspected right. Whoreson was not the ideal partner in crime.
Cirilla|Damned simpleton got it in his head that we'd cheated him and kidnapped Dudu.
Geralt|Who you promptly freed only to have to flee to Temple Isle. Great idea.
Cirilla|We hadn't planned it, had no time to consider. We just bolted.
Cirilla|I didn't even realize the guardsmen were driving me into a trap. Suddenly, there I was - and I knew I had to disappear. At once.
Geralt|And that's when you landed back in Skellige.
Cirilla|The shore of Hindarsfjall - the first pleasant place that came to mind. Hjalmar and I used to swim there.
Geralt|Wait, so... you actually wound up there by accident? I thought you and Avallac'h had arranged something.
Cirilla|No, he simply sensed me use my power. Just as Eredin can sense where I am, where I travel.
Cirilla|In fact, Eredin arrived soon after I did, his riders in tow…
Cirilla|Once again, things happened quickly: Lofoten, the Hunt's attack, my flight… And then… dreams, just dreams.
Geralt|What did you dream? I've had nothing but nightmares lately, pretty horrible.
Cirilla|Likewise, for the most part. In one, a monster grown from a stillborn child chased you.
Cirilla|Ugh, that was horrible…
Cirilla|Had a few nice dreams. For example, in one we sat around a fire, drinking good wine, and all around people danced and laughed.
Geralt|I like that one a lot better.
Cirilla|Me too. But these dreams, and the others, ended in some tower. No matter what I'd dream, in the end I would enter a tower…
Geralt|Recognize it? Know where it might be?
Cirilla|Not sure… I don't think so, but there was something familiar about it… and something terrifying.
Cirilla|The tower was stark and dead, but at the same time I felt I had to enter it.
Geralt|Did you?
Cirilla|No, dreams all ended with me searching for the entrance.
Cirilla|And the last time, instead of the tower, I saw your grizzled face.
Cirilla|If not for the scar over your eye, I'd have thought I was still dreaming.
Geralt|I was afraid you were dead.
Geralt|Found some dwarves here. Said they'd tried to wake you, but you were cold as ice, and you weren't breathing.
Cirilla|And yet you came in.
Geralt|Who listens to dwarves these days?
Geralt|Speaking of which - they're probably getting antsy. We should go.
Geralt|Got a boat on the beach. Once we land, we'll head for Kaer Morhen. On horseback.
Cirilla|Right. Conventional means of travel. They're just better.
Cirilla|Though a portal would be quicker…
Geralt|And draw Eredin to us immediately. Rather not risk it.
Geralt|Besides, I hate portals.
Geralt|Damn…
Geralt|Listen, we gotta think of a way to…
Geralt|Get us outta here.
Cirilla|They'll know where we've gone, they'll know how to find me!
Geralt|They already do.
Geralt|Ciri, take us home.
Geralt|Not this time.
Geralt|C'mon, got a long road ahead of us. Let's go.
Geralt|We should go.
Geralt|Hmm… Think I know the rest.
Geralt|We should get going.
Geralt|How'd you wind up here? What happened?
Cirilla|Last I remember, I was on the Skellige shore, arguing with Avallac'h. He wanted to take me somewhere safe.
Cirilla|After that, nothing but dreams.
Geralt|The world where Eredin couldn't find you, what was it like?
Cirilla|You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Geralt|Try me.
Cirilla|People there had metal in their heads, waged war from a distance, using things similar to megascopes.
Cirilla|And there were no horses, everyone had their own flying ship instead.
Geralt|Ciri, stop fooling around.
Cirilla|Told you you wouldn't believe me.
Cirilla|Ah, we should've stayed there…
Geralt|What's Eredin after? What's he want from you?
Cirilla|What everyone wants - control of my powers.
Cirilla|His home world faces annihilation. Eredin's decided to invade ours. Brilliant, wouldn't you say?
Cirilla|Can't achieve much on his own, so he needs to bring an army.
Cirilla|Except his navigators can't possibly move him and thousands of Aen Elle between planes. Their abilities won't allow it.
Geralt|Whereas yours will…
Cirilla|Exactly. And if I die in the process - well, that's a necessary sacrifice.
Geralt|Why exactly is Avallac'h helping you? Sages've never been fond of humans…
Cirilla|He doesn't do it for me, it's about my power.
Cirilla|As if it could ever be about anything else.
Cirilla|Avallac'h tried to teach me how to control my ability. He was also making sure I didn't fall into Eredin's hands.
Geralt|Waiting at Kaer Morhen with the others.
Cirilla|You lifted the curse?
Geralt|Yeah, tell you on the way.
Geralt|Guess not all of Vesemir's teachings've receded into oblivion.
Cirilla|"A witcher can forget to eat, to drink, to breathe, even, but a witcher never, ever forgets to care for his blade."
Geralt|Huh. Uh, yeah, used to repeat that incessantly. Never tired of doing it, either.
Cirilla|What creature was it?
Geralt|Huh? Creature?
Cirilla|One that gave you the scar over your left eye. It's new, I don't remember it.
Geralt|Souvenir from the cockatrice of Spalla. Another addition to the collection, nothing special.
Geralt|Yours has healed beautifully, though.
Cirilla|Avallac'h - he prepared some special ointments for me.
Cirilla|But that was before the curse gripped him… Wonder where he is now.
Geralt|You landed with the Crones, he ran into Keira.
Cirilla|Keira? Keira Metz? What's she doing in Velen?
Geralt|And that way turned out to be Dandelion. A good friend… Not necessarily the wisest choice under the circumstances.
Cirilla|The best I could do. Besides, what do you have against Dandelion?
Geralt|Nothing… Absolutely nothing… Go on, please.
Geralt|Hm… Lemme think… He's a chatterbox who's prone to hysteria and has about as much courage as a rabbit?
Geralt|Ideal partner for the heist of the century, really.
Geralt|Hiding from witch hunters.
Geralt|She developed a taste for country life, decided to open a practice out there.
Cirilla|Is that so? And does she lead her cows out to pasture at dawn, milk them herself? I'd love to see that!
Geralt|So would I… Except she'd need a cow, a luxury that would attract attention in Velen. And Keira's fiercely determined not to do that.
Geralt|She's hiding from witch hunters.
Cirilla Young|Geraaalt!
Cirilla Young|Don't go! Don't leave meeee!
Cirilla Young|Geralt!

Yennefer|Did you help Lambert complete sq106_killbill?
<|endoftext|>
Vesemir|Whoa, now. There, there, it's a--
Vesemir|What the--?
Vesemir|Welcome back, child…
Yennefer|Ah! Ciri! Haha…
Yennefer|My, you've grown beautiful.
Vesemir|No point standing around. Come on, time to greet the others.
Cirilla|You've not changed a bit. Any of you… All just like I remembered.
Geralt|What?
Triss|Little sis!
Vesemir|They're all here, everyone you asked for help. Avallac'h's resting in the tower - still in pretty bad shape.
Vesemir|No reason to do it out here. Come inside.
Geralt|Time's short. Wild Hunt'll be here soon.
Geralt|Glad to see you, Triss.
Triss|Thank Yennefer. She's the one who invited me.
Yennefer|There'll be time to talk later. We should confer now.
Yennefer|Would you like a moment to yourselves?
Geralt|Sorry, we didn't mean to--
Yennefer|I know. It's a simple question. Do you want some time alone?
Geralt|No… let's go. They're waiting.
Geralt|Long as you really don't mind…
Geralt|Seemed to take that pretty well.
Triss|Or wants us to think she did.
Geralt|Haven't been here in a while, have you?
Triss|Too long. How's the guest room? Anything changed?
Geralt|Mhm. The bed… it, uh, broke.
Triss|Not a problem. We'll sleep on the floor. Spread out a hide and…
Yennefer|Ahem.
Geralt|Guess we should go.
Triss|I-- Maybe I'll give you two a moment.
Yennefer|Triss, please…
Triss|No, no. You must've missed each other terribly, A minute's delay won't hurt anyone.
Geralt|No, we should get going. They're waiting for us.
Geralt|Fine. So a minute, then we go, all right?
Geralt|Hm. This is just a little awkward…
Yennefer|Forty-five seconds.
Geralt|Huh?
Yennefer|We've forty-five seconds left. Well, thirty, now. And then we throw the gauntlet at the Wild Hunt. So I beg you, use these seconds well.
Geralt|Yen, I adore you.
Yennefer|Hm. No points for creativity. But for your candor…
Yennefer|Time to go.
Triss|Let's not stand out here.
Yennefer|Yes. Come, we should hold council.
Geralt|Damn, it's good to see you again.
Yennefer|It's grown cool. Come. We should hold council.
Triss|Yen, you know the Wild Hunt better than anyone else. Tell us about the magic they use.
Yennefer|Their navigators open portals, rifts that we might counter with dimeritium or our own magic.
Yennefer|They also summon the frost that occupies the voids through which they travel.
Triss|There's just not enough of us. It'll be a hard fight.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|How are you? Kaer Morhen to your liking?
Keira Metz|More so than Velen, but that's hardly an achievement.
Geralt|How was your trip? Get here all right?
Keira Metz|Ah. So much tramping over mountain paths, you're lucky I made it.
Keira Metz|Greetings, Geralt.
Keira Metz|If I'm to die today, I wish to look smashing for the occasion.
Geralt|Getting all gussied up for the Wild Hunt?
Keira Metz|Women only ever beautify themselves for their own satisfaction.
Geralt|Glad you're here.
Keira Metz|It's good to see you again.
Geralt|Expected you earlier.
Keira Metz|I started off heading in the opposite direction, but then turned around.
Geralt|What made you change your mind?
Keira Metz|There are times when a woman should simply not explain her decision. That goes doubly for sorceresses.
Geralt|Won't find too many comforts, but try to feel at home.
Keira Metz|Leave my dresser alone!
<|endoftext|>
Zoltan Chivay|Glad you got her back here.
Zoltan Chivay|Wee Ciri's grown up on us!
Zoltan Chivay|Hah! You found her!
Zoltan Chivay|They told me the Hunt was after her, that those buggers might burst in uninvited.
Zoltan Chivay|So I've made a Mahakaman mix. When this ploughin' blows, it'll be bits and pieces, nothin' more.
Geralt|Everything in order?
Zoltan Chivay|Dammit. Downright afeared to sneeze near these barrels.
Geralt|Bring all your tools with you?
Zoltan Chivay|Thought to myself, a battle approaches. Blades'll need honin', plate'll need some hammerin'. That sort o' thing.
Geralt|Thought right. Thanks, Zoltan.
Zoltan Chivay|Plan to top that by brewin' some more Mahakaman mix. Shite's so volatile, ye need but glance at it to set it off like a flamin' fart. Very useful durin' sieges.
Geralt|Willing to craft something for me?
Zoltan Chivay|Course. Provided you've a diagram.
Geralt|All right. We'll talk later, Zoltan.
Zoltan Chivay|How goes it, Geralt?
Geralt|Great to see you in a good mood, Zoltan.
<|endoftext|>
Hjalmar|Damn shame Vigi and Folan aren't here.
Geralt|Thanks for coming.
Hjalmar|Imagine we'd miss a chance like this? Never!
Vigi|Cryin' shame Folan's not with us.
Geralt|Thanks for coming.
Hjalmar|Imagine we'd miss a chance like this? Not on your life!
Folan|Grief grips me that Vigi's not here.
Geralt|Thanks for coming.
Hjalmar|We've spent our lives preparin' to face the shadows Mörhogg.
Vigi|We slew the giant, we'll slay the wraiths as well.
Folan|Aye!
Hjalmar|Good to see you!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|We're not masons.
Ermion|A shame. We'll not be able to keep the Hunt outside the fortress.
Vesemir|That's no loss. We don't know much about breaking sieges, either.
Vesemir|We'll face them in the courtyard.
Vesemir|Never thought gas could stink so much. We need to warn the others, make sure no one comes through here with an open flame.
Vesemir|What's next?
Ermion|I could use a drink.
Vesemir|So could I. We'll find something after the council.
Vesemir|Heheh, you've gathered quite the team.
Ermion|Whoever repaired these walls did a shoddy job of it.
Geralt|Maybe we can still patch up these holes?
Vesemir|We've got the materials.
Ermion|I can help you if you wish.
Geralt|What about Lambert?
Vesemir|Hm, I know exactly how he'll take to bricklaying.
Geralt|What's the gas for?
Ermion|It's highly flammable. I aim to detonate it, incinerate a few of the Hunt's riders in the process.
Geralt|Castle walls won't suffer?
Ermion|The fortress walls are in ruin. They cannot be harmed any more than they already are.
Vesemir|I certainly hope this gas will work.
Ermion|It shall. We must just ignite it at the right moment.
Vesemir|And that hole… is that there for good?
Ermion|We shall worry about the hole once it is all over. And now, step back, master witcher.
Ermion|Anair, anadar, vallanda!
<|endoftext|>
Eskel|You should have said no.
Letho|None of your business.
Lambert|Wrong - it is his and mine. Rather not have you behind our backs during the battle.
Geralt|What is it now?
Lambert|Why did you even bring him?
Geralt|I need Letho.
Eskel|Our opinions count, too.
Geralt|I need anyone who can face the riders of the Hunt in battle. Your likes and dislikes - they count for a lot less than that.
Lambert|You're making a mistake.
Geralt|I'll keep an eye on Letho.
Letho|And I promise to be a good boy.
Lambert|Oh, fuck off.
Eskel|Geralt, this is a problem. Don't dismiss it.
Lambert|Still got time to leave.
Letho|I do, but I don't wanna.
Eskel|Think it over.
Letho|I will. I do my best thinking alone.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Gotta save Ciri - whatever the cost. And Letho's faced the Hunt before.
Roche|I don't question his abilities. I simply don't trust him.
Geralt|Letho won't betray us.
Roche|You're naïve, always have been. Usually I don't give a shit, but this time it could kill Ves and me both.
Roche|Think this through before it's too late.
Ves|We'll stay and help. But we don't want him at our backs.
Geralt|I'll keep an eye on Letho.
Letho|And I'll behave, I promise.
Roche|Watch this murderer, and you won't be watching the enemy. Why is the kingslayer so important?
Letho|Eredin's a king, ain't he?
Roche|Fuck you. Both.
Geralt|I'm in command here. I make the decisions. You both know there're no debates when you're at war.
Roche|You know what, Geralt? I've done many things in my life I wish I hadn't. But I've always respected those who I served, always put my trust in them.
Roche|Here, at Kaer Morhen, this will be the first time I do neither.
Geralt|Glad to see you.
Roche|Hmph. Set out alone, Ves tracked me down. Insisted on coming.
Ves|I ought to give you a hiding for not asking my help. But I took it all out on Roche along the way.
Letho|Ah, some old friends.
Ves|What's this whoreson doing here?
Geralt|We need him.
Ves|You might've forgotten what he did. I haven't.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Thanks for coming, both.
Ves|No need. By the way, it seems you forgot to invite me.
Roche|Hold your excuses, Geralt. Ves vented on me all the way here, she's almost over it.
Roche|Are we really to be so few?
Geralt|Yes.
Roche|Certainly hope you know what you're doing.
Ves|We'll scout around a bit. Need to acquaint myself with the battleground.
Geralt|Quality's what counts, not quantity.
Roche|A witcher's approach. Works when hunting and fighting beasts, not necessarily in full-scale battles.
Roche|I certainly hope you know what you're doing.
Roche|You're here.
Roche|Elbow higher.
Ves|It's high enough.
Roche|You drop it a bit every time you release the string.
Roche|Apart from which, flaming projectiles require a different trajectory.
Ves|What the hell's better about flaming arrows, anyway?
Roche|They set things alight.
<|endoftext|>
Vesemir|There's the laboratory… and the workshop.
Eskel|One thing to remember - we've got limited resources and even less time. We oughta decide what kind of weaponry'll be most useful against the Hunt.
Vesemir|Absolutely. We need to assign one type of weaponry each to the lab and workshop.
Geralt|Who needs access to the lab?
Vesemir|I started brewing some potions. Like to finish if you don't mind.
Eskel|I could prepare more of those witchers' traps. But I'd need all the lab equipment.
Geralt|Always relied on potions. We should brew as many as possible.
Vesemir|Let's talk about the workshop.
Vesemir|Been wanting to fix that breach in the wall. But we'll need the same tools to clear the rubble from the armory.
Geralt|Rubble?
Vesemir|Haven't you heard? Roof caved in a couple of years back. There's some excellent swords in there. Swords we could use.
Lambert|Filling in the breach seems just as important. They come through there, the siege'll be over awfully quick.
Geralt|Fixing the breach in the wall's a priority.
Vesemir|Let's not forget the laboratory.
Vesemir|We won't have time to do much else.
Vesemir|Everything settled?
Geralt|Yes, settled. We don't have much time, so let's get to work.
Vesemir|Let's sum up: Yennefer will create a magic barrier to repel the main assault. That should push the opposing force into the woods.
Vesemir|Where Lambert and Geralt'll be waiting. They'll use dimeritium to close the navigator's portals, stop as many warriors as possible from entering the fortress.
Vesemir|Triss'll be waiting for their signal, then give the riders hell.
Vesemir|All others will repel any foes who make it inside the fortress walls.
Geralt|If anything goes wrong, we abandon the outer courtyard, pull back to the keep.
Geralt|Remember - Eredin can't get his hands on Ciri. That's most important.
Geralt|Let's look at the map of the fortress, figure out the details.
Geralt|Can't help feeling we've overlooked something important.
Lambert|Don't think about it.
Geralt|What's ready?
Lambert|Haven't had much time to prepare, so not much, honestly.
Geralt|I'm exposing you all to danger. Unnecessarily.
Lambert|You worry too much. Wipe that frown off your face. We'll make it.
Geralt|Thanks. For everything.
Lambert|I'll saddle the horses. Come once you're ready to head into the woods.
Geralt|Takin' Letho with us.
Lambert|You know my opinion.
Geralt|Can't help but worry. We're short on meteorite steel swords.
Lambert|Got enough for everyone. Here, Vesemir dug this up for you.
Lambert|Gnome-forged blade, cross-guard's elven handiwork. Cuts through armor like butter.
Lambert|Your potions.
Lambert|Got a new potion formula for you. White Raffard's Decoction - fortified. Take it.
Geralt|Wanted to talk about what we can expect…
Lambert|Thanks, not interested. You should talk to Ciri - fine mood she's in.
Vesemir|Where Lambert, Geralt and Letho'll be waiting. They'll use dimeritium to close the navigator's portals, stop as many warriors as possible from entering the fortress.
Geralt|Hm. No, we should do it differently.
Vesemir|What do you want to change, Wolf?
Geralt|We should use the lab differently.
Geralt|We've always relied on potions. Need to brew as many as possible. That'll take all the equipment we got.
Vesemir|Let's talk about the workshop.
Geralt|Need to patch the breach in the wall first and foremost. Worth using the whole workshop to do it well.
Vesemir|And the laboratory?
Geralt|Gonna need weapons that pierce the Hunt's armor. Let's clear the rubble out of the armory.
Geralt|There aren't many of us, so we should prepare as many traps as possible. Devote all our efforts to that.
Geralt|Oughta use the workshop for something else.
Geralt|We'll need weapons that can pierce the Hunt's armor. Gotta clear the armory.
Geralt|There aren't many of us, so we'll need to prepare as many traps as possible.
Lambert|Geralt should decide. I'll join whoever gets the lab. All I need's a few ingredients, a flask and use of the hearth.
Lambert|Had some time to experiment after we resolved the Karadin matter. Like to finish that.
Lambert|Think I know how to produce a fortified formula of White Raffard's Decoction.
Geralt|Anyone have any ideas for the workshop?
Zoltan Chivay|I brought this Mahakaman mix - flammable as bone dry saltpeter and ploughin' sticks to anythin'.
Zoltan Chivay|We fill some barrels, stack 'em in a narrow passage, and fire 'em up at an opportune moment.
Ermion|Do you know we stand on a vast deposit of gas?
Ermion|If need be, I could open cracks in the earth, create explosions. I would need to prepare, though.
Roche|Since you plan to ambush the Hunt in the woods, I could dig some trapping pits. Blue Stripes style.
Vesemir|Meaning?
Ves|Deep as the dark abyss. Bottoms bristling with sharpened stakes.
Geralt|Thank you for coming.
Geralt|The Wild Hunt'll be here soon. They're coming for Ciri, want to take her. We'll stop them.
Lambert|How do you even know the Hunt'll show?
Cirilla|They always know where I teleport to, and they move from place to place in an instant.
Lambert|So what's our plan?
Geralt|Eredin, the King of the Hunt - he's confident, he'll strike hard, hoping to defeat us with the force of the blow alone. We've gotta take the initiative away from him, foil his plan.
Yennefer|I'll generate a magic dome over the fortress. It will scatter them, force them to land in the woods.
Lambert|If they're dispersed out in the woods, we could hunt down small groups of riders.
Geralt|Got our first volunteer for the hunting party. I'm the second.
Yennefer|The Hunt will try to penetrate into the fortress through navigator portals. I can do nothing against this kind of magic, so you'll need to find and close as many as you can while hunting in the woods.
Geralt|Lambert'll make us dimeritium bombs. Remember the formula?
Lambert|Course.
Yennefer|Excellent. Yrden should work on the portals as well. I shall also give you each an amulet. Snap them in half and you'll become invisible, at least while you remain still or move slowly. Move abruptly, engage any foes, clash with them, and they will see you.
Yennefer|Apart from that, they will be able to hear you and smell you. If you come across a large unit, do not attack. Signal Triss, and she will provide support.
Triss|I'll look for your signal. Soon as I see it, I'll rain fire on the forest.
Geralt|What else do we have that we can use?
Geralt|Ciri's most important in all of this. The Hunt's after her, and we have to defend her at all costs.
Cirilla|What do I do?
Yennefer|Stay inside the keep. If they break through, come inside, we'll all converge to help you.
Cirilla|Out of the question. I can look after myself.
Vesemir|No one doubts that, child. But remember the most important moment when hunting a monster?
Cirilla|"Wait for an opportunity."
Triss|After the council I'll give you an amulet. If you use it, a ball of fire will land where you're standing. Just in case.
Geralt|Remember, there's only a few of us. We have to help each other, work together.
Geralt|If anything goes wrong and the Hunt puts us on the defensive, we pull back, make a stand at the gates of the fortress.
Geralt|The inner courtyard is our last line of defense. If we don't stop them there, we're doomed.
Letho|Count me in, too. Always believed attack is the best defense.
Geralt|There aren't many of us, but I'd trust any of you with my life. Work together, and we'll defeat the Hunt.
Geralt|When they attack, Yen'll dome the fortress with a magic shield. Hunt'll be forced to land outside the walls.
Geralt|Get everybody together. Time to talk.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Got a minute?
Cirilla|Oh. Serious talk coming.
Geralt|They're after you. No matter what happens, you can't put yourself in danger.
Cirilla|Want me to sit and wait while others risk their lives for me?
Geralt|Listen to me this once - don't take matters into your own hands.
Cirilla|Don't treat me like a child.
Geralt|Didn't even do that when you were one.
Cirilla|I like it when you smile.
Cirilla|Come here.
Cirilla|Everything will be all right.
Geralt|I won't let them take you, you know that?
Cirilla|I know.
Geralt|You gotta keep clear, stay out of trouble.
Cirilla|It'll start soon.
<|endoftext|>
Lambert|Gonna have to thank Yen once this is all over. That spell - really something.
Lambert|And the invisibility.
Geralt|Hounds could sniff you out, so don't get too close. And you'll be visible soon as you start fighting. Remember that.
Letho|He always talk this much?
Geralt|Only when he's nervous.
Letho|Mean to say Merigold can conjure up more than a cloud of butterflies?
Geralt|Lots more. Wait and see.
Geralt|Good work with these bombs, by the way.
Lambert|Aim at the portals, be precise. I'm out of dimeritium.
Geralt|Yen mentioned casting the Yrden at the rifts. Said the Sign could seal them.
Lambert|They're here. Time to say hello.
Geralt|Slow down. Element of surprise is key. Stay hidden, give Triss a chance to show them what she can do. Then we'll hit 'em.
<|endoftext|>
Lambert|Hah.
Lambert|Come to mama.
Lambert|Keep comin'.
Lambert|Dammit.
Lambert|Ugh!
Lambert|How many more your mama spawn?
Lambert|Not that I don't trust this invisibility shit, but we should keep our distance from those creatures.
Lambert|That was amazing. Thanks.
Lambert|Next time you get the feeling I'm about to piss off Merigold, make sure and knock me upside the head.
Lambert|Bastard wants to break through, get inside!
Lambert|He's through!
Lambert|She's one of us, Geralt. No way we'll let 'em take her.
<|endoftext|>
Vesemir|There's too many of them!
Vesemir|More incoming! Watch out!
Vesemir|Dammit!
Vesemir|Cut off the courtyard! Shut the gates!
Vesemir|They killed him! The sons of bitches!
Vesemir|They killed Lambert!
Vesemir|Lambert, dammit! Stay with us!
Vesemir|We gotta pull back! Yennefer's strength is waning!
Vesemir|Watch out for yourself.
Vesemir|Ready yourself, another wave's coming soon!
Vesemir|Close the damned gate!
Vesemir|The gate, dammit! Shut the gate!
Vesemir|Large detachment approaching from the woods!
Vesemir|We need to close the gate before they get inside.
Vesemir|How'd you fare in the woods?!
Geralt|We sealed two rifts, then ran into one of the Hunt's lieutenants.
Vesemir|Be alert! Watch out for each other! They've found a way inside!
<|endoftext|>
Lambert|Geralt! C'mere!
Lambert|Look! They're regrouping!
Geralt|See the commander? Name's Imlerith. I remember him from back when I rode with the Hunt.
Lambert|Dammit, spell's waning. We're becoming visible.
Letho|We gonna try to kill him?
Geralt|Too risky.
Letho|Pansy.
Lambert|What's with Merigold?!
Geralt|Shit.
<|endoftext|>
Vesemir|You were meant to wait inside!
Cirilla choice|I must confront them.
Cirilla|I cannot hide forever. I must face them!
Vesemir|Back inside, now!
Cirilla|No! Geralt gave the signal from the woods, and Triss hasn't cast the spell!
Vesemir|Dammit! All right! Run to her!
Zoltan Chivay|Duvvelsheyss!
Cirilla choice|I want to fight, too.
Cirilla|I refuse to sit idle while you risk your lives for me.
Vesemir|Back inside!
Cirilla|Hold on, Triss!
<|endoftext|>
Triss|Just in time!
Geralt|Everything all right?
Triss|Yes, thanks. Things were looking shaky.
Vesemir|We had to fall back. They tried to get in through the main gate. I'm afraid they could succeed next time.
Triss|What's with Eskel? We have to retreat!
Cirilla|He's in trouble! I'm going to help him!
Triss|Remember the stone I gave you!
Cirilla|{*Long two-fingered whistle*}
Cirilla|See? I can do it, too.
Eskel|Thank you!
Cirilla|We have to open the gate for them!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|We've gotta close the portals! If we don't, we die!
Eskel|Geralt! They're coming in through Savolla's breach!
Geralt|Towards Eskel! Everyone move!
Cirilla|There are more and more!
Cirilla|Help me! I'm near the pendulums!
Geralt|On my way!
Eskel|Damn the dogs. We should've patched up that wall!
Eskel|The wall stopped 'em!
Cirilla|Hjalmar's sealed the portal!
Cirilla|The wall's holding! And Hjalmar sealed the rift!
Cirilla|Splendid work!
Triss|Geralt! I can't hold them any longer!
Triss|They're swarming the yard by the main gates!
<|endoftext|>
Vesemir|Come!
Cirilla|Ah!
Cirilla|Geralt… Where is he…? We must--
Cirilla|Argh!
Eredin|You shan't escape me this time!
Cirilla|Aaaargh!
Eredin|Imlerith!
Vesemir|Run!
Eredin|She'll not abandon you.
Eredin|You humans are so… impractical.
Vesemir|Ciri! No!
Vesemir|Aargh! I forbid you!
Vesemir|You always were an unruly child.
Vesemir|I adored that about you.
Vesemir|Now fly.
Cirilla|Noooooooooooooo!
Cirilla|{Emitting a mind-piercing, ear-bleed inducing shriek.}
Avallach|Gvaed, gvaed uncym, cym’morth!
<|endoftext|>
Cirilla|I… I was too late… to help him.
Geralt|It's not your fault.
Cirilla|I should not have fled here to Kaer Morhen.
Yennefer|Avallac'h is weak, but alive. Triss is tending to the others.
Cirilla|I nearly killed you… Killed everyone…
Geralt|I can't cry, don't know how…
Geralt|Vesemir's funeral - we should prepare.
Geralt|Don't blame yourself. No witcher's ever died in his own bed.
Cirilla|You don't know how it is. To see someone you love die… because of you, for you.
Geralt|We all knew what we were signing up for.
Cirilla|Yes, and you saved me. For how long? A week? A month?
Geralt|We'll hide you, cover your tracks…
Cirilla|No. I will flee no more.
Avallach|Va fail.
Avallach|For those who remain, death should never take precedence over life.
Avallach|Pay your last respects to your friend. Then we must hold council.
Avallach|Pay your last respects to your friends. Then we must hold council.
Geralt|Vesemir and Lambert deserve a proper goodbye. We should prepare.
Geralt|We'd all be dead if not for you.
Cirilla|No, Geralt. The Hunt would never have come to Kaer Morhen if I wasn't here.
Cirilla|And Lambert… Dead -because of me.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Haven't had a chance to talk. Thanks for your help. And for looking after Ciri.
Avallach|You will thank me later. Now, we must take Zireael from here, hide her. And then gather a greater force.
Triss|Anyone, everyone we could count on came here to Kaer Morhen.
Yennefer|Which is why we must seek the help of enemies. Magic is our best defense against the Hunt. We need sorceresses. Archmistresses of magic.
Triss|You mean the Lodge?
Geralt|I don't want the Lodge anywhere near Ciri. Just don't trust those women.
Yennefer|What would you have us do instead? Fight alone, and die a beautiful but pointless death?
Yennefer|No, Geralt. By some miracle we survived that fight, eking out a measly victory at enormous cost. No more guerilla warfare - time to face the enemy in open battle.
Yennefer|I've made an agreement with the emperor. In exchange for its help, the Lodge will be granted amnesty and find asylum in Nilfgaard. That will be our bargaining chip.
Yennefer|Triss, I wish to leave today to find the sorceresses. Will you help me?
Triss|Of course. Even got an idea where you could start.
Cirilla|Dammit!
Cirilla|Again you plan without even asking what I think! I've had enough of this!
Cirilla|I won't be taken somewhere like a… bundle! I will not sit and twiddle my thumbs! I'm sick of waiting, sick of hiding!
Geralt|You can't expose yourself.
Cirilla|Am I a banner to be held aloft and kept from the enemy? That's how you treat me. None of you has the courage to face this threat!
Cirilla|Yet we must kill them, or sooner or later we will all die.
Geralt|Better go after her.
Avallach|Wait, she needs time. We must let her resolve her grief on her own.
Avallach|Then we should start training as soon as possible. She must learn to control her abilities.
Geralt|This training really necessary?
Yennefer|You saw what happened. She could be a greater threat than the Hunt.
Geralt|Fine. We'll stay here a while longer. Then join you and Triss in Novigrad. Meet at Dandelion's inn.
Triss|Come on, Yen. The sooner we leave, the better.
Geralt|See you.
Geralt|Ciri needs time.
Avallach|True. But she also needs training. She must learn to control her abilities.
Geralt|You're right. Proved today you can take care of yourself.
Avallach|Easier to pat someone on the back and hope things will work out than it is to face the truth.
Avallach|Zireael possesses a great power she cannot control. She is a danger - to herself, to others. Until she learns to control it, she should remain isolated.
Cirilla|First of all - bollocks. Second - if you're going to speak of courage, at least address me directly, and not through Geralt.
Cirilla|I'm gone.
Geralt|Don't trust the Lodge one bit, but doesn't seem like we have a choice.
Yennefer|Because we don't.
Geralt|Many of the Lodge's members are dead, the rest are in hiding.
Yennefer|Philippa Eilhart, Margarita Laux-Antille and Fringilla Vigo are likely still alive.
Triss|And Francesca and Ida? Think they'd agree?
Yennefer|I think they'll take convincing. Would you rather speak to Keira alone?
Triss|That would probably be best.
Avallach|Zireael can harness immense amounts of the Power. Why has no one taught her to control this?
Yennefer|Actually, some did teach her.
Avallach|Clearly to no effect.
Yennefer|I'll gladly argue with you about this - some other time.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|So? Tell me.
Roche|I can say I've seen it all now.
Ves|I still don't believe everything that happened.
Geralt|Thanks for coming. Thanks for risking your lives for me.
Ves|Take care of the girl. Don't let anyone harm her.
Geralt|What will you do?
Roche|We're bound for Novigrad, to fight the next fight.
Ves|If you miss us, look for us at the camp.
Geralt|Risked your lives for me. How can I repay you?
Roche|We'll think of something, right?
Ves|Definitely.
Ves|Damned shame.
Roche|Ugh.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|That was tough.
Letho|We managed.
Geralt|Thanks for helping.
Letho|You're welcome.
Geralt|Would you consider staying at Kaer Morhen?
Letho|It'd be nice. At least for a while, till I figure out what's next.
Geralt|Agreed. Do it.
Geralt|What will you do now?
Letho|Probably head east, cross the mountains.
Letho|After that? We'll see.
Geralt|Farewell.
Letho|Witchers never die in bed.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Thank you.
Ermion|Please. She was my ward, too. And the old should only ever stick around to help the young.
Ermion|You know this hardly ends your struggle?
Geralt|I know.
Ermion|Whatever you aim to do now, remember you'll find souls willing to aid you in Skellige. Myself, Crach, his children…
Geralt|Don't really know what I'll do next.
Ermion|When doubts plague your mind, follow your instincts.
Ermion|Should they steer you wrong and land you in muck, you'll land at peace with yourself. And that's most important.
Geralt|Good advice.
Ermion|Bah! 'Course it is! I am a hierophant, aren't I?
Ermion|I must pick a course for home soon. Take care of yourself, and Ciri.
Geralt|Thanks again, for everything.
Geralt|Thanks, I'll remember that.
Ermion|I shall take another look at the wounded, but I'll need to go soon. I'll leave you some medicines.
Geralt|Go in health, Ermion.
Ermion|Till we meet again.
Ermion|I regret I did not know him better.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|How are you feeling?
Lambert|Please.
Geralt|Thanks for everything.
Lambert|Sure.
Geralt|Get your health back.
Lambert|Leave me alone.
Geralt|What's eating you?
Lambert|Do you seriously not know?
Lambert|Get lost. I'm done with this idiotic conversation.
Lambert|Thanks for your help back there, during the battle. Shame Vesemir wasn't so lucky.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What's on your mind?
Eskel|Kaer Morhen. Can't imagine this place without Vesemir.
Eskel|I'll head down the valley soon. Then find somewhere else to winter next year.
Geralt|Come on. It's the only home we've ever had. Stay.
Eskel|No, Geralt. Place has been dying a while. Last nail in the coffin today. Time we accepted that.
Geralt|I get you.
Eskel|Try my luck in Lormark. There's always work where there's war. After that, we'll see.
Geralt|Till next time.
Eskel|See you, Wolf.
Eskel|This place. No point ever comin' back.
Eskel|No reason to come back here. It's like Kaer Morhen died today.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Thanks for everything you did for me and Ciri.
Keira Metz|May I be honest? Had I known what would happen here, I'd never have come anywhere near Kaer Morhen.
Keira Metz|I'm glad I could help, but I shall leave as soon as Lambert feels better.
Geralt|You going together?
Keira Metz|I've an idea, but I need a witcher to help me see it through. Lambert has agreed to assist me.
Geralt|Hm. Good luck. And thanks again.
Keira Metz|We're even now.
Geralt|Take care of yourselves.
Geralt|And thanks again for everything.
Keira Metz|I'm sorry for your loss, Geralt.
Lambert|I'm in no mood to talk.
<|endoftext|>
Hjalmar|There y'are.
Hjalmar|Cryin' shame about Vesemir. I'm sorry.
Geralt|Thanks for your help.
Hjalmar|I'd a debt to pay.
Geralt|Heading straight back to Skellige?
Hjalmar|Wouldn't be right to tarry - war with the Black Ones won't wait.
Hjalmar|You can count on me, you know? Always.
Geralt|I know. Thanks.
Hjalmar|Duty calls.
Hjalmar|But listen, Geralt, you've a king for a mate. Rare's the man who can claim that.
Hjalmar|If you, or Ciri, or you and Ciri… if yous ever need help, the gates of Kaer Trolde stand open.
Geralt|Thanks, I'll remember that.
Geralt|So long, Hjalmar.
Hjalmar|Ah, the courage of the man.
<|endoftext|>
Zoltan Chivay|Come to see how I'm feelin'? Thanks, not bad.
Geralt|That's good.
Zoltan Chivay|Argh, son, horrible about Vesemir. I know you were close.
Geralt|Thanks. We were.
Zoltan Chivay|Listen, far be it from me to stick my beard where it'll no scratch no itch, so don't take this the wrong way. I want to help, whatever you decide. But to my mind, we've got to counterattack.
Zoltan Chivay|We've got to find the Hunt, Eredin, and charge at 'em both like a bull at a heifer.
Geralt|Not that simple, unfortunately. We have no way of finding them, they find us easily. Can take us by surprise whenever they want.
Zoltan Chivay|Forgive me, Geralt, but that's the blatherin' of a man who clearly can't snap out of it after a tragic loss.
Zoltan Chivay|Drink it off, sleep it off, whatever it takes… Just get yourself together and think things through.
Geralt|I'll do that, Zoltan.
Geralt|There aren't enough of us. Sure, we repelled the Hunt's assault, but that was a miracle, plain and simple. Won't be so lucky next time.
Zoltan Chivay|Dammit all, he'll be missed.
<|endoftext|>
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Geralt of Rivia?
Geralt|Know any other Geralts?
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Come with me, please. They've been expecting you.
Avallach|…You will position yourselves on the cliffs, here, here and--
Yennefer|Thank you. I believe we know how to form a circle.
Philippa Eilhart|Even those of us who lack eyes for the moment.
Avallach|I simply wish to avoid-- Oh, Geralt. We were waiting for you.
Geralt|That's nice of you.
Geralt|You were about to explain your plan.
Avallach|It's simple… which does not mean it will be easy to execute.
Avallach|I shall activate the Sunstone. If Caranthir answers the call, the Naglfar should appear in the bay shortly afterwards.
Avallach|The Lodge must then prevent the ship from returning to the world of the Aen Elle, while the imperial fleet blocks its escape by sea.
Avallach|The 7th Ymlats Infantry Regiment under Duke var Attre must then board it. With your help, naturally.
Geralt|Wow… Emhyr's being generous with his resources.
Fringilla Vigo|He's halted his entire Skellige campaign to help us.
Geralt|Not doing it just to be nice, believe me.
Yennefer|He's doing it for the same reason we all are.
Philippa Eilhart|Ladies and gentlemen - less talk, more action, please. Sisters, we must scale the cliffs.
Triss|Good luck.
Geralt|Plan's missing one important element - what about Ciri?
Avallach|Zireael will wait. At a safe distance from the Naglfar.
Geralt|Makes sense.
Cirilla|Huh. I thought I could at least count on you to treat me seriously.
Geralt|Never treat you any other way. You know that.
Geralt|You can't defeat Eredin, don’t stand a chance. Dammit, I don't know if I can. So stay away from him, far away.
Avallach|Zireael, do you swear to stay on shore?
Cirilla|Do I have a choice?
Avallach|Where are you going?
Cirilla|For a walk. Or is that not allowed either? Because I could break my leg…
Avallach|Oh, yes… the Elder Blood can be fiery.
Geralt|Gets that from her father.
Avallach|I beg to differ… Emhyr is a pragmatist, Ciri an idealist.
Geralt|An idealist? What're you talking about?
Avallach|Never mind.
Avallach|Time is short. If you wish to do something, brew your substances or whatnot… Do it now.
Avallach|You won't get the chance later. I shall await you by the boats, amongst the soldiers.
Avallach|Unless you wish to come with me now?
Geralt|No time to lose. Sooner we get this done, the better.
Avallach|Follow me.
Geralt|Could probably use a few potions. Go. Join you soon.
Avallach|Just don't delay too long.
Geralt|Triss? Everything all right?
Triss|Yes. I just wanted a moment to talk to you. Before… before it begins.
Geralt|Chin up. The Hunt's weakened. We've got--
Triss|No. No more about the battle.
Triss|Just hold me. And say something nice.
Geralt|All this snow… it makes me think of Kovir.
Triss|And what do you think about?
Geralt|That it's like this all year there. Dark and cold.
Geralt|And you know what? It won't bother me one bit.
Triss|It won't?
Geralt|No. Because the days, yeah, days might be short, but the nights? Nights'll be long.
Geralt|I can't wait.
Triss|Unbelievable. You said something romantic! You, Geralt of Rivia!
Geralt|Moment of weakness.
Triss|Well, none of those during the battle, please. If anything should happen to you…
Geralt|Can't think about that.
Triss|So what am I supposed to think about?
Geralt|Emhyr var Emreis. On parade. Completely naked.
Triss|Ah, Geralt. You're so charming when you try to be funny.
Geralt|Try? Take it back. That was a great joke.
Triss|Mhm. Sure.
Triss|I love you, you know.
Geralt|You trying to make me cry? Ciri'd never let me forget it. Go on, get.
Geralt|Love you too.
Geralt|I'll manage.
Triss|You always say that.
Geralt|Haven't killed me yet.
Geralt|Well, except for that one time.
Geralt|Hm. There's a lighthouse not far from here, you know.
Triss|Geralt! Are you suggesting we--?
Geralt|No… well, at least not right now. Just wanted to say…
Geralt|Wanted to say that since… since Novigrad, whenever I see the beam of a lighthouse, I feel good. Thinking of you.
Geralt|Yen? Why're you here?
Yennefer|To see you.
Geralt|Something happen?
Yennefer|Not yet. But it might soon. We may not survive this. In fact, our chances are slim.
Geralt|We've come a long way, and I'll be damned if we've come to fail. It'll be all right.
Yennefer|I admire your optimism. Wish I shared it.
Yennefer|Listen to me. Once it's over, if we survive… I wish to leave, go far away. And I'd like you to come with me.
Geralt|Where?
Yennefer|Wherever. To Poviss, beyond the Dragon Mountains, Zerrikania, even. As far as possible from politics, plots and so-called high society.
Geralt|I'd go anywhere with you.
Yennefer|The answer I was hoping for.
Yennefer|Go, Geralt, Avallac'h awaits.
Yennefer|And don't get killed, witcher.
Geralt|I dunno, Yen. Honestly, sounds too beautiful to be possible, even.
Yennefer|You can always return - if after a month we can't stomach each other's company.
Geralt|All right. Willing to try.
Yennefer|That's good enough for me.
Geralt|You? Dropping plots and politics for good? You're in your element in that world, it's your life.
Yennefer|Time to start anew.
Geralt|I'll believe it when I see it. Even now, you're up to your neck in it.
Yennefer|Yes, but only to set matters straight, to be able to withdraw having retained the upper hand.
Geralt|What then? A small, secluded hut with a flower garden to tend to?
Yennefer|Why not? If that is what you dream of?
Yennefer|We shall leave together, go where we please, do whatever strikes our fancy.
Yennefer|So. Coming with?
Geralt|Well, we are here to battle Eredin and the Wild Hunt at full strength. Could be like Sodden. Could be worse.
Yennefer|Nothing could be worse than Sodden was.
Geralt|Yen, try not to panic. Just doesn't suit you.
Yennefer|I'm not panicking. Just trying to be realistic. But that's not what I came to discuss.
Geralt|Telling Ciri she can't do something is counter-productive. Speaking from experience there… Ultimately, she does what she wants.
Avallach|Let us hope.
Geralt|Pardon me?
Geralt|Didn't sound convinced.
Avallach|No. But I can't very well tie her up and teleport her away, can I?
Geralt|Hm. Definitely advise against trying that.
Geralt|Wild guess - not what you had in mind…
Cirilla|No. I wanted to go with you - that was my idea.
Avallach|But I won't allow it. Far too great a risk.
Geralt|Well, can't say you're wrong there.
Geralt|Don't have the right to order her around.
Avallach|Amusing. Zireael said the same thing, only at much higher volume.
Avallach|I do, in fact, have this right. For only I know how to activate the Sunstone. Which I shall do on my terms - or not at all.
Avallach|Zireael recognized the strength of my argument. I've no doubt you'll do the same.
Geralt|What about you? Where will you be?
Avallach|Waiting in reserve. If something goes wrong… I shall react.
Geralt|Mm. Like a general commanding troops from a hilltop. Gonna signal us by horn or use messengers?
Avallach|Exquisite irony, but what did I do to deserve it? Have I given you cause to doubt my intentions?
Geralt|Really? Seems to me you'd started already.
Avallach|We were discussing questions of a magic nature. Nothing of great interest to you.
Geralt|Right. 'Cause I'm just a simple witcher.
Yennefer|Simple, yet with so many complexes. Not now, Geralt.
Yennefer|Don't worry. Simplicity has a charm all its own.
<|endoftext|>
Cirilla|"I give you my heart?" What kind of a spell is that?
Avallach|It's an old love letter. Ancient.
Avallach|As I said, this stone was to reunite a pair of lovers.
Cirilla|Never thought I'd say anything of the sort to Eredin.
Cirilla|{Aen verelith cyrre naid. } [I give you my heart.]
Cirilla|{Ader eich blaen eide ‘me. } [But I shall take your head.]
Yennefer|The elven bauble worked.
Avallach|They approach.
Avallach|Break a sword, Geralt.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Follow me. The Naglfar must be nearby.
Cirilla|Silence. It's completely still.
Avallach|It's a trap. We must flee. Now.
Cirilla|Not this time.
Avallach|No, Zireael. You are not ready. You do not control your powers.
Cirilla|I'll manage. Get out of my way.
Avallach|Ciri.
Avallach|Ciri!
Avallach|The ice… It's a spell. You must find the mage who cast it, destroy his staff.
Cirilla|I'll not stop with his staff.
<|endoftext|>
Eredin|Pathetic… simply pathetic.
Crach|Stop playing the warrior… Fight!
Eredin|You would die an honorable death, is that it? You will be disappointed.
Crach|Aaaargh!
Crach|Aaaaach!
Eredin|Any last words?
Crach|Haven't killed me yet.
Eredin|No. I'm enjoying this. You are my toy.
Eredin|Out of my way, old man… And I shall spare your life.
Crach|I dare you to take it instead.
Eredin|Hahahaha… As you will.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|We need to focus on Ciri. What do you think Avallac'h wants from her?
Yennefer|Same as Eredin, I imagine. He will use her to open a gate between the worlds.
Yennefer|Search the beach to start…?
Geralt|Mhm.
Yennefer|Geralt… I did help Triss escape.
Yennefer|Why do the others even concern you?
Geralt|You serious? If that's really your question, no way you'd understand my answer.
Yennefer|Once it's over, you'll go to Kovir, live happily ever after.
Geralt|What I do once it's over is not your concern.
Geralt|What's next for them?
Yennefer|Interrogation, torture… Then death, possibly. Philippa certainly.
Yennefer|I'm not proud of myself, Geralt. But as it is, I've risked much by saving Triss.
Geralt|I understand.
Geralt|And thank you. For helping us.
Geralt|Right.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Where's Ciri?
Yennefer|What? I thought you knew.
Geralt|All I know is Avallac'h might've betrayed us.
Geralt|What the--? That a storm?
Yennefer|Geralt… Look!
Geralt|Wha… What the hell's happening?!
Yennefer|I find it damned hard to believe, but…
Yennefer|The gate between the worlds is open.
Yennefer|We must reach the tower. Quickly. Stop Avallac'h while this can still be reversed.
Geralt|Least we know where to look for Ciri.
Yennefer|Mhm. Follow me. And stay alert.
Geralt|What're we gonna find there?
Yennefer|If the tomes are to be believed, nature's laws will cease to hold. Gravity, time, Undvik - all of it will be turned on its head.
Geralt|Exaggerating for effect, right?
Yennefer|Not one bit.
Yennefer|The Conjunction of Spheres has begun. The worlds - they're aligned, permeate one another. Avallac'h could use this - bring the Aen Elle here… or something far worse.
Yennefer|Magic anomalies of the third order.
Geralt|Specifics, Yen. Specifics.
<|endoftext|>
Yennefer|Damn… Avallac'h's surrounded the tower with a magic barricade.
Geralt|Can you dismantle it?
Yennefer|Dismantle? No. I can make a tear, at best. But only for a moment, because there's no--
Geralt|Specifics, Yen. Will we both get through?
Yennefer|No. You must go alone.
Geralt|I'll come back - with Ciri.
Yennefer|I know.
Yennefer|Agored, teirgane agored!
Yennefer|Now, Geralt!
Yennefer|I'm fine. Now go… and give Avallac'h my heartfelt regards.
Geralt|Get to work.
Yennefer|I'll be fine. Go.
<|endoftext|>
Avallach|Geralt… So unfortunate. I'd hoped you wouldn't have to witness this.
Geralt|Where's Ciri?
Avallach|Nearby. Listen…
Geralt|Shut up.
Geralt|I've heard enough of your bullshit. Draw your weapon, let's get this over with.
Geralt|Think I'm gonna fall for that? No chance, you're wrong.
Geralt|Trusted you once. Won't make that mistake again.
Avallach|I am not your foe. I am merely helping Cirilla.
Geralt|I don't believe you. Can't. Not after all that's happened.
Cirilla|Will you believe me?
Cirilla|Avallac'h speaks the truth. I asked him to help me open the tower - because I aim to enter it.
Geralt|Why the hell would you do this? The Wild Hunt's been defeated.
Cirilla|The White Frost has not.
Cirilla|The prophecies are true. I have seen worlds bound in ice. I know what awaits you.
Cirilla|Only the Elder Blood can stop the White Frost. Only I can stop it.
Geralt|I couldn't care less about the White Frost. Let's just leave, go.
Cirilla|No, Geralt. I've seen what is to come, I know destruction approaches. The worlds will freeze, one after the other, and all life will be eradicated.
Cirilla|Only I can prevent this from happening.
Geralt|There's gotta be another way…
Cirilla|What can you know about saving the world, silly? You're but a witcher.
Cirilla|This is my story, not yours. You must let me finish telling it.
Cirilla|I'm sorry.
Geralt|Ciri, I forbid you.
Cirilla|You know me. Nothing I like more than breaking rules.
Geralt|This? You're breaking more than a rule.
Geralt|Don't do this… to me. Please. Not now.
Cirilla|Geralt, believe me… A tavern, mulled wine, our boots drying by the fire - I'd like nothing better.
Cirilla|But I can't. I must try. For you, Yen, Triss… for everyone.
Cirilla|Keep your fingers crossed.
Geralt|Good luck, Ciri.
Cirilla|Perhaps I should have told you. I see now you might have understood.
Geralt|Know you better than you think.
Geralt|Don't keep me waiting.
Geralt|You don't have to make this sacrifice.
Cirilla|You're wrong. The White Frost is inevitable, it will come to freeze the worlds one after the other, eradicating all life.
Cirilla|Only I can stop the destruction. I've given it much thought and made my decision.
Geralt|Ithlinne's Prophecy is drivel. Destruction is not our fate.
Avallach|You have seen the future, don't you remember? Entropy cannot be stopped. The worlds will freeze, one after the other, and all life will perish.
Cirilla|Avallac'h is right. If I do nothing, humans, elves, all will face destruction.
Geralt|Avallac'h's muddled your mind with a fortuneteller's fables.
Cirilla|You're wrong. The White Frost truly does approach. Worlds will freeze, one after another, and all life will be eradicated.
Cirilla|Avallac'h gave me a choice. I made the decision. I must stop it.
Geralt|Didn't think it worthwhile to tell me, warn me of your plans?
Cirilla|I'm sorry. I know, I should have… but I feared you'd not understand.
Geralt|Ahhh… Feels like I'm talking to Yennefer.
Geralt|Leave with me. Please.
Cirilla|I will, Geralt, once I emerge from the tower. If I emerge.
Geralt|Think I'm willing to spare you?
Avallach|I think you will not attack one unarmed.
Geralt|Wouldn't be so sure. I'm in a foul mood.
<|endoftext|>
Werewolf Berem|The Crone, what's she done to you?
Geralt|Stole my daughter's medallion.
Werewolf Berem|Heed my words. The Crone will fight like a hounded wolverine. She may cripple, even kill you…
Werewolf Berem|Why risk it? Find the girl a new pendant. Her sorrow will pass in time.
Geralt|No, it won't. My daughter's dead.
Geralt|No.
Geralt|Speak.
Werewolf Berem|There's a wolf den nearby. Wolf cubs inside. Carry them out of the swamp.
Geralt|Why?
Werewolf Berem|They'll not survive here, or they'll change into something… evil.
Geralt|I'll try.
Geralt|None. How many have you already killed? How many more might you still?
Werewolf Berem|I don't know. Mostly I had no choice in the matter. 'Tis a foul age.
Geralt|That it is.
Werewolf Berem|A last wish?
Geralt|There's one. Find the Crone, guide me through the swamp - to her.
Werewolf Berem|And then?
Geralt|Then I'll see.
Werewolf Berem|Uh… The Crone, what's she done to you?
Geralt|Stole my daughter's medallion.
Werewolf Berem|If I may… why risk it? The Crone'll fight. Like a hounded wolverine, she'll fight. She may cripple, even kill you.
Werewolf Berem|Find the girl a new pendant. Her sorrow will pass in time.
Geralt|No, it won't. My daughter's dead.
Geralt|Go.
Werewolf Berem|Who are you?
Geralt|You know who I am. And why I'm here.
Werewolf Berem|I do. You needn't… I'm no longer a threat. I starve, for the swamp is poisoned. I've no strength to hunt humans.
Geralt|Crone summon you?
Werewolf Berem|In my sleep… once I had wolf dreams. Now I dream hunger, pain, and blood.
Geralt|Where is she?
Werewolf Berem|Out there… in the swamp.
Werewolf Berem|Is there no other way?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Where's the Crone?
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Sod off, your kind's not welcome. Leave our lands.
Geralt|Not just yet. Soon. First the Crone.
Baron Bandit Strong 02|You're one. We're ten, we've got hounds. Wanna end like the she-wolf?
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Uhh…
Baron Bandit Strong 01|We'll flay you alive, you wretch!
Geralt|Calm down. We don't need to fight.
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Just go. And the Lady of the Swamp - you leave her be…
Geralt|Release the she-wolf.
Baron Bandit Strong 01|She's not weakened yet.
Baron Bandit Strong 02|She's ragin', knows she's good as dead but has yet to accept it.
Geralt|Get outta here.
Baron Bandit Strong 01|What? You dim in the head? Beast killed our cattle, and she'll keep huntin' - damned animal! It's the ploughin' enemy! It's her, or us!
Geralt|My sentiments exactly.
Geralt|See ya. Got something to do.
Geralt|True enough.
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Shove off, then! You're spoilin' our fun.
Geralt|What're you doin' here?
Baron Bandit Strong 01|A she-wolf's been on the hunt the last few days. Killed a cow, wounded a man. So we set some traps.
Baron Bandit Strong 02|Stupid beast walked straight into one, heheheh. Once she tires, we'll set the 'ounds on 'er, have us a wolf-baitin'.
Geralt|What happened to your ear?
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Why's it matter? None of your ploughing concern.
<|endoftext|>
Werewolf Berem|One cub lives…
Geralt|Come on, no time for that.
Werewolf Berem|Won't survive on its own.
Geralt|Lead me to the Crone.
Geralt|What's your name, werewolf?
Werewolf Berem|Berem.
Geralt|Lead me to the Crone, Berem.
Geralt|Maybe, once, in a different time… I'd have helped.
Werewolf Berem|She's close. Somewhere here…
Geralt|Go back to your wolf dreams, Berem. Save the cub. Go away, far away. Find yourself a comely wifewolf. And live.
Werewolf Berem|Let me help you.
Geralt|No.
Werewolf Berem|Remember - like a hounded wolverine she'll fight. She could kill you.
Geralt|I know. Now go.
Werewolf Berem|I can't look at this… You must die…
Geralt|Stay out of it!
<|endoftext|>
Witch Weavess|Patience, sisters. I sense him, he comes. You shall yet have his soul…
Witch Weavess|His pain, his icy suffering will be yours. And you will feast on him.
Witch Weavess|Soon, sisters, very soon.
Geralt|Come out!
Witch Weavess|I sense your pain. I see your fear…
Witch Weavess|Look about you! Feel their hatred? You slaughtered their brethren for a fistful of coin. They would see you suffer, while you've lost your claws, wolf.
Witch Weavess|The prophecies do not lie… You cannot survive this struggle.
Witch Weavess|Zireael is dead. Naught but a small frozen corpse in an icy wilderness.
Witch Weavess|And you are afraid… You feel fear.
Geralt|You lie. I don't feel a thing anymore.
Witch Weavess|Do you see them? They've come to the feast! I shall feed them your pain!
Geralt|Best go back where they came from if they value their lives. I've come for you.
Witch Weavess|They know you'll not spare them… You're a witcher, a murderer. You hunt down and kill.
Geralt|Can't be bothered any more.
Geralt|Do what you want - you can still go. None who stay will leave here alive.
Witch Weavess|Kill him!
<|endoftext|>
Witch Weavess|You've changed. You suffer.
Witch Weavess|You seek death, I feel it. I know the smell of a suicide's breath… The omens do not lie.
Witch Weavess|That little whore, her accursed blood… She slew my sisters. I am alone - 'tis your doing.
Geralt|Not anymore.
Witch Weavess|Despair devours you like maggots devour a corpse!
Witch Weavess|Do you wish to die, witcher? Do you wish your suffering to end?
Witch Weavess|Your flesh cured with toxins… sweet with pain.
Witch Weavess|She suffered too. Miserable and alone. Oh, so alone…
Witch Weavess|This shall haunt you forever.

Zoltan Chivay|I might believe you if you showed me a pair of monogrammed batiste galligaskins.
Dandelion|Haha, more likely you'd just say I stole them.
Zoltan Chivay|Heheheh.
Geralt|Dimwits.
Triss|Weren't you supposed to be somewhere?
Geralt|Yeah.
Geralt|All right.
Triss|Where'd you agree to meet?
Geralt|By the huntsman's cottage.
Zoltan Chivay|I might believe you if you showed me a pair of monogrammed batiste galligaskins.
Dandelion|Hahaha. More likely you'd just say I stole them.
Zoltan Chivay|Heheheh.
Geralt|Dimwits.
Verden Peasant 03|Can I get ye more of that hooch you praised so high yesterday?
Geralt|Nah, gotta go. Promised I'd be at the huntsman's cottage at the crack of dawn.
Verden Peasant 03|Oh, aye, that's right - rabbit huntin'.
Geralt|Mhm.
Zoltan Chivay|I might believe you if you showed me a pair of monogrammed batiste galligaskins.
Dandelion|More likely you'd just say I stole them.
Zoltan Chivay|Heheheh.
Geralt|Dimwits.
Yennefer|You were supposed to be somewhere.
Geralt|I was.
Geralt|Fine.
Yennefer|Where will you meet?
Geralt|Near the huntsman's cottage.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|I'm going rabbit hunting. Dandelion?
Dandelion|Glad to have some rabbit stew. But freezing my ass off to amass the ingredients? Did not sign up for that.
Dandelion|I'll gather the herbs, spices. No stew is complete without some sun-drenched thyme and the aroma of rosemary…
Zoltan Chivay|Aye, fields're covered with rosemary bloomin' like wild just before Yule, aren't they?
Dandelion|That's why I'll be gathering my herbs from the kitchen.
Geralt|Eh, so long.
Geralt|Got plans for all these lands and titles?
Dandelion|I'll take possession of them. 'Course, there's also the issue of progeny…
Zoltan Chivay|Is that so? Mean you finally found a lassie worthy of the great Dandelion?
Dandelion|My dear friend and companion, why, my heart belongs to the one and only Priscilla, known also as Callonetta.
Zoltan Chivay|Your heart might, true… but the rest of your anatomy…
Dandelion|I resent the insinuation! And hasten to remind you that you are talking to a count!
Geralt|No need for the count to get riled. Rather you told us how your beloved is.
Dandelion|She's recovered. Back to full health physically. Mentally - almost.
Geralt|Recovered? What'd I miss?
Dandelion|Ah, right… Ended up not hearing about it?
Zoltan Chivay|She was attacked. Around the time you were in Novigrad. Bugger hurt her somethin' awful.
Dandelion|But as I said, she's getting better. Even started performing again. Thank the gods.
Geralt|Give her my best.
Dandelion|Don't worry, I will. Give her a kiss, even - a bit from you, mostly from me!
Dandelion|Recovered, mostly. Even started singing again. Her voice is a little lower pitched, gravelly… Actually sounds a little better.
Geralt|Sorry I couldn't help you out. Had to--
Dandelion|Forget about it, Geralt. Done and gone.
Dandelion|Thanks for helping back then, Geralt. Meant a lot. Really.
Geralt|What're friends for…?
Zoltan Chivay|You just invent this count bit? Quite the imagination for one who's sober.
Dandelion|Geralt'll vouch for me. Tell him - I've always said I'm a count.
Geralt|True. You have always said so.
Zoltan Chivay|Just nobody's bothered to verify it, hahahah.
Geralt|What's with this count business all of a sudden?
Dandelion|Well, when we finally leave this gods-forsaken dung hole, I plan to reclaim my heritage - the titles and estates that are rightfully mine.
<|endoftext|>
Temerian Peasant 02|To think the nag would know me after all these years…
Temerian Peasant 02|They're smart, grow attached - bit like people. Saw officers weep for their fallen mounts…
Temerian Peasant 02|Though wailin' women and cryin' babes didn't move 'em one bit.
Geralt|Glad to see the horse is in good hands.
Temerian Peasant 02|The best. His owner's. D'you miss me, Gulden, huh? D'you miss me?
Geralt|I'd say he did. Bolted off soon as he sensed you. Toppled anyone in his way.
Temerian Peasant 02|Um… D'you mark anyone calling after 'im? "Ploughing armpits" or somesuch?
Temerian Peasant 02|But one man here curses so odd. My neighbor, Mirko. Gave him Gulden to care for when I left… Oughta go see 'im, must be worried.
Temerian Peasant 02|Here… Token o' my appreciation. For running after Gulden, to see he was all right.
Geralt|Which side you fight for?
Temerian Peasant 02|Like most - my own. Fought to stay alive.
Temerian Peasant 02|Dyin's all the same - dirt and shite, be it under the Redanian eagle or the imperial sun. No glory in it.
Geralt|Been away long?
Temerian Peasant 02|A year, not quite. But it feels like more, lemme tell you.
Geralt|They force you to join?
Temerian Peasant 02|Nah. I was eager to fight. Thought I'd bring home more'n just the scars on my back.
Temerian Peasant 02|Did see a chunk of the world, though. Some mammoth battles. A few famous generals from afar. And lots of whoresons.
Temerian Peasant 02|Didn't see the emperor take Novigrad, but I don't regret it. Beautiful city…
Temerian Peasant 02|But I wonder what awaits me back home…
Temerian Peasant 02|But things could be looking up. Folk say Chancellor Dijkstra's a wise one, rules by reason…
Geralt|Wise? Cunning's probably more accurate.
Temerian Peasant 02|And madman Radovid wins it in the end. Simple soldiers know that man's missing a joining peg.
Temerian Peasant 02|Word is the emperor poisoned his own army. There's politics for you. Boggles the mind.
<|endoftext|>
Temerian Peasant 03|She's gone.
Geralt|Mad she had to wait?
Temerian Peasant 03|No, eager to roam the fields. Prepared the cover scents and oiled the jaw traps all by herself.
Geralt|Make a good hunter, wouldn't she?
Temerian Peasant 03|Nah. Too impatient, that one.
Temerian Peasant 03|Probably snatchin' rabbits barehanded, puttin' 'em in the traps 'cause they're too slow to step in themselves.
Geralt|Where'd she go?
Temerian Peasant 03|Not far. Over yonder.
Geralt|Farewell.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Not up to hunting rabbits anymore?
Cirilla|Tsk. Not really.
Geralt|What now?
Cirilla|Nothing. Just sitting, waiting for you. It's nice here.
Geralt|Ah, wait till you see Dol Blathanna in winter. And the Blue Mountains.
Geralt|We'll head east soon as the snow melts. Think we might've settled in a bit too much…
Cirilla|You promised to show me that griffin's nest before we left. Let's go now.
Geralt|We should pick up the snares.
Cirilla|Mislav will collect them. And we should probably try to hunt along the way.
Geralt|Just this morning the rabbits were a matter of life and death.
Cirilla|To be honest, I just wanted to go for a walk with you.
Geralt|Let's go, then. Nest is just up the hill. Griffin's carcass might still be there.
Cirilla|Mmm, splendid!
Geralt|You actually interested?
Cirilla|Absolutely. You said it yourself - a royal griffin's a rare sight.
Geralt|Not that rare. Venture to say we'll have to slay a couple more before we get back to Kaer Morhen. But if you wanna see the nest, it's just up the hill.
Cirilla|Come!
<|endoftext|>
Cirilla|What?
Geralt|A hair faster - that's all it needed to be to rip your shoulder wide open.
Cirilla|But it wasn't and it didn't. We killed it. What is this about?
Geralt|You're angry, wanted to unload. But be that careless, and next time--
Cirilla|Don't you understand?! There won't be a next time!
Geralt|Ciri? What're you talking about?
Cirilla|I'm sorry. It's just… it's not a good time.
Geralt|Wanna head back?
Geralt|All right. Enough. Let's go fishing.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|We bring Dandelion a nice, fat perch, and he just might forget about the rabbit stew.
Cirilla|Mhm.
Geralt|Shame he didn't come along.
Geralt|He could use a bit of exertion.
Cirilla|Mhm.
Geralt|Ice shouldn't be too thick here.
Cirilla|Uh-huh.
Cirilla|How exactly do you plan to catch anything?
Geralt|Heh, you'll see.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|I'll be damned…
Cirilla|Should we go?
Geralt|No, no way.
Geralt|Lake's gotta be full of perch, bream, or pollard. Mmm... fresh pollard - would you like that?
Cirilla|I wouldn't mind some, but... do we plan to wait here until he leaves?
Geralt|No, we'll scare him off.
Cirilla|How?
Geralt|I'll improvise. Wait here.
Geralt|With bombs.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|All right. Let's go.
Cirilla|Who taught you that?
Geralt|Vesemir. A long time ago.
Cirilla|How long?
Geralt|Very. Back when I wanted to call myself Geralt Roger Eric du Haute-Bellegarcie.
Cirilla|What? Hahahah.
Geralt|Tell you about it tonight.
Cirilla|And about the time you broke your leg, after wagering you'd jump off the roof of Kaer Morhen and land a horse's back?
Geralt|Hm, how do you even know about that?
Cirilla|Eskel told me. But I want to hear you tell it. I'm certain you have a rational explanation.
<|endoftext|>
Cirilla|They're here for me, Geralt. I'm going to Nilfgaard. To Emhyr.
Cirilla|I know you didn't expect this, but…
Cirilla|In Vizima, my father and I spoke… for long. Argued, really, and parted. Then a messenger came, with a letter. I didn't say anything at first because I wasn't sure, and then…
Cirilla|I realized I had to stop fleeing. Realized that if I wish to change anything, I cannot do so hunting monsters round forgotten villages. I must do so from there. From Nilfgaard.
Geralt|Is this what you want?
Cirilla|Yes.
Cirilla|You'll not try to stop me? Take me to the Blue Mountains by force?
Geralt|Traveled half the world to find you, but I never intended to force anything on you.
Cirilla|I know.
Geralt|You'll be fine, you're a witcher.
Cirilla|We needn't say goodbye.
Geralt|Course we don't.
Cirilla|I don't know when we'll see each other again.
Geralt|You know where to find me.
Cirilla|You can't possibly stay at Kaer Morhen all the time.
Geralt|Makes no difference. You'll find me.
Cirilla|True.
Geralt|Remember what I taught you. Never know - could be useful there, too…
Geralt|Yeah we do.
Cirilla|You could come with me.
Geralt|No, Ciri. That's not me, you know that.
Cirilla|I know, but… I thought--
Geralt|You've made your decision. And I made mine long ago.
Geralt|War's over. I'll have plenty of work chasing monsters round forgotten villages.
Cirilla|When do you leave?
Geralt|Now.
Cirilla|So this is…
Cirilla|Won't you at least give Yennefer some time to pack?
Cirilla|Won't you at least give Triss some time to pack?
Geralt|You could've told me, warned me.
Cirilla|I wanted to, but… I didn't know how. I've been happy here. I was afraid I'd ruin it. I wanted to make every minute count.
Geralt|So, back at the nest - that was about this.
Geralt|I didn't pry, didn't want to force you to tell me. Thought we had time. A lot more time.
Geralt|You make this choice on your own?
Cirilla|If you're asking whether Emhyr threatened to send the Alba Division after you if I didn't agree, then the answer is no.
Geralt|Letter must've been convincing, then.
Cirilla|It was.
Cirilla|If you mean to suggest Yennefer had anything to do with this, then the answer is no.
Geralt|Great. She even know?
Cirilla|No. And I'd prefer she not get involved this time.
Geralt|I'll let you tell her that.
Cirilla|Almost managed to forget it was today.
<|endoftext|>
Emhyr|Speak.
Geralt|Ciri is dead.
Emhyr|How did it happen?
Geralt|The White Cold… You're familiar with the prophecy? Ciri tried to stop it. She did, but paid the ultimate price.
Emhyr|Where is the body?
Geralt|I doubt it'll ever be found.
Emhyr|Who else knows?
Geralt|Avallac'h, elven Sage… But I doubt you'll find him, either.
Emhyr|And Yennefer?
Geralt|She's decided to stay in the North. Provided you don't object.
Emhyr|I don't. And you?
Geralt|Plenty of work for witchers after a war. I'll travel east, maybe north…
Emhyr|Did Cirilla say… Did she ask you to convey anything?
Geralt|She regretted not getting a chance to say goodbye.
Emhyr|Did she tell you this, really?
Geralt|Didn't have to. She wanted to make peace, I know that.
Geralt|If there's nothing else…
Emhyr|There is. But you may go.
Emhyr|Witcher. I do not wish to see you. Ever again.
Geralt|You weren't a good father. Ciri saw you as a threat.
Geralt|Even if she'd asked me to tell you something, I doubt you'd have liked to hear those words.
Emhyr|Understood.
Geralt|We didn't talk about you.
Emhyr|I see.
Geralt|Yennefer needs me. I can't abandon her.
Emhyr|I understand.
Geralt|Someone's waiting for me.
Emhyr|Triss Merigold? Fear not - I do not intend to have her pursued.
Geralt|That's none of your business. Not anymore.
Emhyr|Hmmm.
Emhyr|Enough.

Temerian Merchant 01|Good luck.
Geralt|Need a hand with your wagon?
Temerian Peasant 01|Err… no.
Temerian Merchant 01|It's not exactly ours, more a captured vehicle. Booty, you might say.
Temerian Bandit 03|Folk must've abandoned it in their rush - to where, I don't know. Be a shame for the Reds to claim it, loot it.
Temerian Bandit 03|Grown accustomed, we have.
Temerian Merchant 01|With the Black Ones gone, witch hunters'll move in. Yet life'll roll on. We've to seize the day.
Temerian Peasant 01|True, that! So let's get to work afore night creeps up on us!
Geralt|Sure you don't need any help?
Temerian Merchant 01|I believe we will manage.
Temerian Bandit 03|Where you headed? Nearest inn, by the looks of it.
Geralt|Yeah. Supposed to meet someone first - at the former campsite of the Nilfgaardians. You take care, now.
Geralt|Time I was on my way. Good luck to you.
Geralt|Change is coming.
Geralt|Need any help? With the wagon?
Temerian Bandit 03|We'll manage, mate.
Temerian Merchant 01|We thank you for your concern.
Temerian Peasant 01|Aye, 'cause you don't look like no wheelwright, that's sure.
Temerian Bandit 03|That's the truth of it.
Temerian Merchant 01|The Nilfgaardians have fled, the Redanians are barely arrived, and bandits sense the void, practically feel they have free rein.
Temerian Peasant 01|Barely got away, then busted a wheel and watched our horses run off into the wood.
Geralt|Need help with your wagon?
Temerian Bandit 03|Think we'll be all right, heheh.
Temerian Peasant 01|Hah, aye, you betcha, we'll manage.
Temerian Merchant 01|True, the barrels are ample, but we shall pour some off of each soon.
Temerian Bandit 03|True, no denyin' it.
Temerian Merchant 01|Nilfgaard flees, yet here it seemed nothing could move them.
Temerian Peasant 01|Left their wine behind, too. That's generous.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Nobleman 02|The Redanians will be here shortly.
Novigrad Nobleman 02|The decision must be taken now. If the emperor refuses, someone else must do it.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|How dare you?!
Novigrad Nobleman 02|His Majesty would have been a cold corpse if my men hadn't stopped the assassin last night.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|And you believe that gives you the right to be arrogant?
Novigrad Nobleman 02|What I believe is that another attempt is imminent, and I can't be sure we'll be able to stop it.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|What of Novigrad's hierarch?
Novigrad Nobleman 02|What of him?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Will he get his well-earned rest or be sent straight to Darn Ruach?
Novigrad Nobleman 02|At his age, the journey would be ill advised. And costly.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Mhm.

Redanian Blacksmith 01|Classic Elder Speech runes. No styling, simple and precise.
Geralt|May I?
Redanian Blacksmith 01|It is yours. If you'd like to test it - had my lacqueys put out a training dummy.
Geralt|Mhm. Your payment - gems only, as requested.
Redanian Blacksmith 01|If you've an eye out for work, heard a striga's prowling the Maribor Forest.
Geralt|Thanks. Need to visit the tavern first, but after… who knows?
Redanian Blacksmith 01|Good luck on the Path, witcher.
Geralt|"Dubhenn haern am glâdeal, morc'h am fhean aiesin."
Redanian Blacksmith 01|"The flash that cuts through darkness, the light that breaks the night."
Geralt|Exactly.
Geralt|"Zireael." Swallow.
Geralt|You're late.
Redanian Blacksmith 01|Soldiers…
Geralt|…blocking the roads, I know. No matter. You have it?
Redanian Blacksmith 01|As agreed.
Redanian Blacksmith 01|Thirty-eight and a half inch blade. Weight - just under 40 ounces. Silver-plated siderite steel core. Glyphs and runes both the length of the blade and on the hilt.
Geralt|Beautiful.
Redanian Blacksmith 01|Been in this trade for three decades. Only the best swordsmen have the coin for my wares.
Redanian Blacksmith 01|When I say no witcher has, or ever had, a better weapon, you ought to trust me.
Geralt|Reputation precedes you, Master Ort. I'd never doubt you.
Redanian Blacksmith 01|The inscription, as you asked…

Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|The Novigrad delegation is half a day's travel from here.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|They truly are rushing…
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Return to your post.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|Yes, sir.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|Fourth Cate Squadron… The Frundsberg Division as a whole… Deserters…
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Does General Voorhis know?
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|He's at a briefing, they're not letting anyone in…
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Nonsense. Get in there and report to him at once.

Redanian Soldier 04|All who provide shelter to, or otherwise abet, their like shall be tried and executed by the will of the Holy Tribunal of the Eternal Fire.
Redanian Soldier 04|The war has caused damages that must be repaired. Taxes shall henceforth be doubled.
Redanian Soldier 04|All who remit payment to the treasury shall receive a note for the equivalent sum.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|Bow before your new lord…
Temerian Merchant 01|…and protector.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|The noble Lord Dagborg assumes these lands to rule with grace and justice.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|Debts, burdens and encumbrances owed to any other are hereby waived.
Temerian Peasant 02|What's that mean?
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|It means you must pay taxes to the noble Lord Dagborg now.

Temerian Bandit 01|My brother-in-law's hidin' Nilfgaardian spies.
Redanian Officer 01|Hmmm…
Temerian Bandit 01|Just don't tell my sister I told you, right?
Redanian Officer 01|Sister's clearly involved. We'll take her in, too.
Redanian Officer 01|We'll need to confirm your allegation.
Temerian Bandit 01|Aye, yep, aye.
Redanian Officer 01|We know which house it is. You may go.
Temerian Bandit 01|Hm, see I heard 'em make mention… that there's some award for information… some coin…
Redanian Officer 01|You heard wrong. The mention was of new taxes.
Temerian Woman 02|I know what I saw. She spent the whole winter cavorting with them Nilfgaardians.
Temerian Woman 02|Ciril saw it, too. Go on, tell them Ciril.
Verden Boy 01|Mhm.
Redanian Officer 01|Did she worship Nilfgaardian idols, their deities?
Temerian Woman 02|How would I know? I'm a decent woman.
Temerian Woman 02|She ought to tell you herself. She will if you poke her with hot irons.
Redanian Officer 01|The Nilfgaardians are gone.
Temerian Woman 02|But she's stayed! We should birch her out of here!
Temerian Peasant 01|Twas like I said. He was workin' with the Black Ones. Tpff!
Redanian Officer 01|Slandering servants of the Eternal Fire and his majesty, was he?
Temerian Peasant 01|And how!
Redanian Officer 01|He's not on the list. What did he do? Exactly.
Temerian Peasant 01|He cozied up to 'em! Worked with 'em! Plotted! Schemed! Against the king!
Redanian Officer 01|Pelko Sambor, aged fifty, two children, a rye field, and one goat.
Temerian Peasant 01|Do what you will. I'm just sayin'.
<|endoftext|>
Redanian Soldier 01|They say you harbor Nilfgaard's spies in your home.
Temerian Peasant 02|Me? Never! Did he say that?
Redanian Soldier 02|Come with us.
Temerian Peasant 03|Hehehe.
Temerian Peasant 02|You bastard!
Redanian Soldier 02|Take him.
Redanian Soldier 02|Come clean, hand them over, and you might come out of this with your life.
Temerian Peasant 02|He tell you this?
Temerian Peasant 02|Go on, search my house. You'll find nothin' and no one.
Redanian Soldier 02|We shall see.
Temerian Peasant 02|Mercy, sir…
Redanian Soldier 01|Enough!

Redanian Soldier 01|Folk say you hide unholy books.
Temerian Peasant 03|Sir, I-I don't even kn-know how t-to r-read.
Redanian Soldier 02|We shall see.
Temerian Peasant 03|I swear by all the gods that…
Redanian Soldier 01|Aha! Blasphemy! Been some time since we've had someone pulled behind the horses.
Temerian Peasant 03|Mercy!
Redanian Soldier 02|Out.
Temerian Peasant 02|Gotsta clean this up.
Temerian Peasant 03|And quick.

Temerian Woman 03|D'you see? Redanians in Milos' field - harrowin', diggin' it up?
Temerian Woman 01|Now?! Why, they'll destroy his harvest, trample the grain!
Temerian Woman 03|Pfff, grain! Folk say the Black'uns buried somethin' in that field, commanded Milos to sow wheat to hide it.
Temerian Woman 01|Aaah!
Temerian Woman 03|Come on. Let's see if they found anythin'.
Temerian Woman 01|Ah, poor Milos.
Temerian Woman 03|I see no reason for pity. He done got chummy with the Black Ones. Just deserts.
Temerian Woman 01|Hmm. He peered at me all funny a month back. Now I know why.
Temerian Woman 03|Nilfgaardian treasure! He didn't peep a word to us about it.
Temerian Woman 01|I wonder, I do, what they'll dig up.
<|endoftext|>
Redanian Soldier 02|Deeper, now! Dig deeper!
Redanian Soldier 02|You're to sift through every inch, is that clear?! Every fucking mole hole!
Temerian Peasant 03|Sir… My grain…
Redanian Soldier 02|Don't interfere. Military operation underway.
Temerian Peasant 03|In my field? Midst my grain? D'you know its worth?
Redanian Soldier 02|Well, we dug up a chest of Nilfgaardian gold out by your boundary line. Would you wager your grain's dearer?
Redanian Soldier 02|Now, I expect if we're thorough, we're like to find more. Midst your grain…
Temerian Peasant 03|But--
Redanian Soldier 02|Off you go! And be sure to stay in the village. We'll want a word with you.
<|endoftext|>
Temerian Woman 01|Help!
Temerian Woman 01|Aaaaaa!
Temerian Woman 01|Mercy!
Temerian Woman 01|Thank you…
Geralt|Wounds need a look?
Temerian Woman 01|I'll manage now.
Geralt|Hunters could come back…
Temerian Woman 01|I'll not wait round for them.
Geralt|Good luck.
Temerian Woman 01|I could use it.
Temerian Woman 01|Unbind me! Quick!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|All right. Out.
Geralt|How was your trip? Smooth sailing?
Dwarf Sleepy|You still on about that leaky tub from the Isle of Mists? You're lucky you and that lass weren't in it with us.
Dwarf Doc|You'd not 'ave fit anyhow. 'Twas so laden that boat, we barely made land.
Dwarf Sneezy|And it reeked of fish manure.
Dwarf Sleepy|Zzzzzz…
Geralt|How'd you wind up here?
Dwarf Doc|Our affairs brought us here. Hard times, you know. Got to earn a coin where you can.
Geralt|Folk around here need surveyors?
Dwarf Grumpy|We've shifted our efforts. Investors now.
Geralt|Investors?
Dwarf Bashful|They've come for us! Hide!
Dwarf Sleepy|Zzzzzz… heh. Heh?
Geralt|What's going on?
Dwarf Bashful|You've not seen us!
Geralt|You stole my boat.
Dwarf Doc|Borrowed. We knew it was yours, still is. You don't think we'd do that to a mate like you - plough you soapless while you slept off a bender?
Dwarf Sleepy|Zzzzzz… mheh… hm? Oh, that's good. Heheheh zzzzz…
Geralt|So, gonna give me my boat back?
Dwarf Doc|Why in the gods' names would you need a boat in this brush?
Geralt|Fair enough, forget I said anything.
Dwarf Doc|Oh, thank ye for that, witcher. Told the lads back then you're a good fella, and we shouldn'ta took your boat.
Geralt|Heard you've gone into investments, asset management…
Dwarf Grumpy|Aye, aye - investments in moveable assets. Well, these days you just never know when--
Geralt|That extra gold chalice could come in handy, I get it.
Geralt|What'd you do with it?
Dwarf Doc|Uh, we don't have it. Found a buyer. Mr. Mirrory, was it? Funny name, paid good coin, though.
Dwarf Grumpy|We'd share it with you, we would, but you look like one who'd just frown on any proceeds from theft.
Dwarf Sneezy|Aye, you got that righteous frown on you. Definitely.
Geralt|Won't say no to friends. Actually, I'll gladly take some of that coin.
Dwarf Doc|Witchers' ethics. Pfft! World's going to shite.
Dwarf Grumpy|Least we nicked his dinghy.
Geralt|I don't want your coin.
Dwarf Doc|Aheheheh! Look at him, all offended! You'd think we showed him a picture of a naked lass.
Dwarf Bashful|Witchers got their creed. No stealin', no pinchin' wenches at the tavern, and no assaultin' travelers.
Geralt|We make exceptions. For travelers, especially.
Dwarf Doc|Uh, oh… er… Farewell, witcher.
<|endoftext|>
Witch Hunter 04|I knew it! Eternal Fire reward you. Get them!
Dwarf Grumpy|I can't believe it! Bloody whoreson witcher!
Witch Hunter 04|Mean to say this is your camp? Five tankards, five saddles - all yours?
Geralt|Been tracking these dwarves for a while. About two days ahead of me now. They abandoned this camp in a hurry, something must've scared them.
Witch Hunter 04|Hm…
Geralt|Could be they heard about Reverend Michelis' ire.
Witch Hunter 04|Let's go. And you, mutant - better not get in our way.
Witch Hunter 04|Don't like your tone, mutant. Will you force me to teach you respect for those who serve the Eternal Fire?
Geralt|Give it a shot.
Geralt|Who's this Reverend Michelis?
Witch Hunter 04|A traveling preacher, a saintly man anointed by the hierarch himself. He's purged thousands of souls already.
Geralt|By, uh, "purging" you mean the cleansing fire of the stake?
Witch Hunter 04|Mheh. You know of another way?
Redanian Officer 01|Thanks, witcher. Get them!
Redanian Officer 01|You mean to tell me this is your camp? Five tankards, five saddles - all yours?
Geralt|Been tracking these dwarves for a while. About two days ahead of me now. Abandoned this camp in a hurry, something must've scared them.
Redanian Officer 01|Why do you trail them?
Geralt|Stole from me, too.
Redanian Officer 01|Stole from a witcher… cunning midgets.
Redanian Officer 01|We'll move on. Catch them yet.
Redanian Officer 01|I see you'll not respond to courtesy.
Redanian Officer 01|Grab him!
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Thank you, witcher. Get them!
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Will you insist this is your camp? Five cups, five saddles? All yours?
Geralt|Been tracking these dwarves for a while. About two days ahead of me now. Abandoned this camp in a hurry, something must've scared them.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Why do you follow them?
Geralt|They stole from me.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Clever little bastards to steal from a witcher…
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|We must go. Should you catch them… well, never mind. We march tomorrow.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|The witcher will not cooperate. Take him.
Witch Hunter 04|The dwarves - where are they?
Geralt|Dwarves?
Witch Hunter 04|Don't feign ignorance. We've been after them since yesterday, after they stole the Reverend Michelis' golden chalice.
Witch Hunter 04|Anyone aiding criminals will be subject to punishment by the Holy Tribunal of the Eternal Fire.
Redanian Officer 01|The dwarves - out with it.
Geralt|Dwarves?
Redanian Officer 01|I don't have time for your games. The Commandant will have his stolen chalice back.
Redanian Officer 01|The thieves - where are they? Tell me, or I'll...
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Where are the dwarves?
Geralt|Dwarves?
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Do not play games with me, witcher. They are thieves, they stole Lord Dagborg's golden chalice.
Geralt|Dagborg? Who's that?
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|The new governor of these lands.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|The chalice must be found. Tell us what you know, or you will force us to extract it.
Geralt|Dwarves are hiding in the bushes.
Geralt|No dwarves here.
Geralt|That a threat?
<|endoftext|>
Cirilla|Is it done?
Geralt|Yes.
Cirilla|Did he believe you?
Geralt|I have no idea.
Cirilla|For the cockatrice. And we've a new contract. It won't pay much, but I think it worth the toil.
Geralt|You've been busy.
Geralt|It's yours.
Cirilla|A witcher's silver sword…
Geralt|Like it?
Cirilla|It's beautiful. May I?
Geralt|Not here. You'll have ample opportunity soon enough, witcher.
Cirilla|What's this inscription?
Geralt|An old witchers' motto. Had a sword like this once myself. But this one's better… much better.
Cirilla|Let's try it out, then.
Cirilla|A witcher's sword… Swallow.
Cirilla|Oooooo.
Cirilla|Beautiful. May I?
Geralt|Not here. You'll have ample opportunity soon enough, witcher.
Geralt|Yen awaits in Ellander.
Cirilla|We can meet her in two days if we hurry.
Geralt|Triss awaits in Ellander.
Cirilla|We can meet her in two days if we hurry.
Cirilla|The Path awaits. Come on.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|I was told I'd find Olgierd von Everec here.
Olgierd Bandit 01|Someone's made an arse of you, brother.
Olgierd Bandit 03|Hahah! Hrkm.
Geralt|So maybe you can make up for that and help me. Brother.
Olgierd Bandit 01|Somethin' tells me you and me've got different mams.
Bandit Chorus|Hahahaha!
Olgierd Bandit 02|All right, Ungus, you've had your fun.
Olgierd Bandit 02|I'm Olgierd. Tell me - what brings you here.
Olgierd Bandit 03|No, no! I'm Olgierd!
Olgierd Bandit Female 01|You? Not likely! I'm Olgierd!
Bandit Chorus|Hahahaha!
Geralt|You're all Olgierd, that it?
Olgierd Bandit 02|Got it right at last!
Geralt|One man split into three bodies. Not interested in his balls, so which of you's got his brain?
Bandit Chorus|Hahahahaha!
Geralt|Not laughing. Guess that means you didn't get the brain.
Bandit Chorus|Hahahahaha!
Olgierd Bandit 03|Nope. I'm the one got his fists.
Geralt|You folk're a hoot and all, and I'd love to stay for more laughs, but time's short.
Olgierd Bandit 01|Whoa-ho! Shit just got serious.
Geralt|Here about the monster in the sewers. Seems Olgierd von Everec's offered a bounty on it.
Olgierd Bandit 02|Shit was serious from the start. Goes without sayin' with a witcher.
Geralt|How's that?
Olgierd Bandit 03|They purge you lot of emotion. It's why you're all stiff. Heh. You'd think they shoved a long pike up your arse.
Bandit Chorus|Hahahahaha!
Olgierd Bandit 02|All right, master witcher. Jests're done. Weathered a good bit as it is. I'm impressed.
Olgierd Bandit 02|Come on. I'll take you to Olgierd.
Olgierd Bandit 02|You're good. You'd fit right in with our band of merry men.
Olgierd Bandit 05|Oi, mate! Your mug's not familiar. What is it you want?
Geralt|Looking for Olgierd von Everec!
Olgierd Bandit 05|Ahhh… That'd be inside!
Bandit Chorus|Hahahahaha!
Geralt|Olgierd von Everec - I'm looking for him.
Olgierd Bandit 01|None here by that name.
Geralt|Can't help wondering - who are you?
Olgierd Bandit 01|Who do we look like?
Geralt|A crew of cutthroats. Or a band of former soldiers who got lucky.
Olgierd Bandit 01|Ah! But that's where you err! 'Cause we're sons of nobles, all!
Olgierd Bandit Female 02|Hahahahaa! And daughters!
Geralt|So, gonna tell me who you are, precisely?
Olgierd Bandit Female 02|The Redanian Free Company. "The Wild Ones," folk call us - owin' to the boar in our coat of arms.
<|endoftext|>
Olgierd Bandit 02|Ataman, sir. You've a guest.
Olgierd|Do you know what types of sculptures fetch the best prices?
Olgierd|Statues of deities, busts of kings… and nudes. And what have we here? A naked wench.
Olgierd|What do you think of her?
Geralt|Sculpture isn't really my thing.
Olgierd|Can't blame you. Contemporary art's become… superficial. And bland.
Olgierd|A century on they'll be using just such nudes on placards to hawk bricks and other banalities. Mark my words.
Olgierd|Agh… I used to like Votticelli. The life he could breathe into a chunk of cold stone…
Olgierd|But I look at it now, and it seems just a rock, ideally proportioned, not a flaw on its surface, painfully perfect.
Olgierd|As lifeless and boring as a boulder at the roadside.
Olgierd Bandit 02|Heheheh.
Olgierd|That's better! More interesting, at the least.
Olgierd|Very well, and now, to the matter at hand.
Olgierd|Let's rejoin the company, partake of some refreshment first.
Olgierd Bandit 01|Ataman Olgierd! Long may he live!
Olgierd Bandit 02|Long live the ataman!
Bandit Chorus|Long live the ataman! Long live the ataman!
Olgierd Bandit 04|Come and drink with us!
Olgierd|Well, we haven't a choice, now.
Olgierd|Fetch us some wine, dear. And a nibble or two!
Geralt|Monster in the sewers - know anything more?
Olgierd|I've no clue what it is. Only that it's deadly.
Olgierd|I'd not have bothered had my cook not become its victim. Ooh, the way she prepared game… Had no equal.
Geralt|That why she was in the sewers? To fetch game?
Olgierd|Nay, she went to a fair with a sister or cousin - matters not. Daft wench convinced her a prince transformed into a toad lives in the Oxenfurt sewers. And you know women - each craves a prince and will wade knee-deep through shite to get him.
Olgierd|Vissy was no exception in that respect. Down she went, never to return. Wasn't the first, it seems, either.
Olgierd|Hey! Leave her be!
Olgierd|Is that any way to treat the lord of the manor's daughter?
Olgierd|Apologies. Now where were we? Oh yes, the contract. So, you'll take it?
Geralt|Consider the beast gone.
Olgierd|Confident. Bring me its head, and the reward shall be yours!
Geralt|Just one formality to resolve first - my pay.
Olgierd|Never you mind that. Return with the beast's head and you'll have leave to take anything you wish from here.
Geralt|Awfully generous. Still, I'd prefer to agree a specific amount.
Olgierd|Ooh, fine. How much would you like? Three, four hundred crowns?
Geralt|Four hundred and fifty.
Olgierd|Agreed. And that'll be in addition to whatever memento you wish to take.
Geralt|Admittedly curious about the monster. But got no time to go after it now.
Olgierd|As you will. I shan't force you. Contract will find a taker in time - if not you, then another.
Olgierd|But you change your mind, you come find me.
Geralt|This some special occasion, or just feel like feasting?
Olgierd|Every occasion's special. Today, we celebrate a dubbing.
Geralt|Whose?
Olgierd|Squire Herodore's new saber.
Olgierd Bandit 04|I've hit on a name for her! Fair saber, I dub thee - Traditiana!
Bandit Chorus|Hahahahaha!
Geralt|I happen to like it. Especially the two ovoid forms.
Olgierd|A jester. Good. I don't like men with no sense of humor. They bore me to death.
Geralt|Frankly, gotta say I prefer the work of Pax Gernst.
Olgierd|Ah, the Koviri School. Are you an Oxenfurt man?
Geralt|No. Know some folk who graduated from there, though.
Geralt|Too sober for that sort of conversation. Rather talk about the contract.
Olgierd|Ah, a man of action - plain to see.
Olgierd|Look who's come back! Come in, sit yourself down!
Olgierd|Come to feast with us, or had a change of heart about the beast?
<|endoftext|>
Shani|Oh no you don't! Hear me? Don't you dare!
Shani|Please don't do this to me.
Geralt|Shani?
Shani|Geralt?
Geralt|What're you doing here?
Shani|Trying to save his life! Help me!
Geralt|Shani, calm down. He's dead.
Shani|I'm sure… something… can be done…
Geralt|Let it go.
Shani|Dammit! All for nothing!
Geralt|You did all you could.
Shani|Thanks, Geralt.
Shani|It's, uh, good to see you.
Geralt|You, too. Lost track of you after I left Vizima. Where'd you go? What've you been doing?
Shani|Um, long story short? I've been treating the sick and wounded, as always. Mainly at my clinic in Oxenfurt. But in Redania I'm called on to help the army at times, as well.
Geralt|I'll want to hear the long story long, too.
Shani|Sure, but, uh, once we're out of these sewers.
Geralt|Redanian army force you to come here, too? Or you just down here for a pleasant stroll?
Shani|Got our orders this morning. I came down here with a whole unit, but… something attacked us.
Geralt|Why'd they send you down here? Only if it's not confidential, of course.
Shani|I need a venom sample - from the beast that prowls these sewers.
Shani|It doesn't just kill those who come down here, you know. The water in so many wells is contaminated. Folk're getting ill, Redanian soldiers among them.
Geralt|Plan to kill the beast. Bring you a sample of its venom after I do.
Shani|Nice of you to offer, but I'd rather go with you, collect the sample myself.
Geralt|Creature's dangerous - you saw what it can do.
Shani|I'm a big girl, Geralt. I can take care of myself. And you know I'll get my way, so don't try to talk me out of anything.
Geralt|Eh, fine, your choice. So show me where the monster attacked you.
Shani|This way.
Geralt|What attacked you? Get a good look at it?
Shani|No. I started running as soon as it appeared. It was huge, spat venom and… made these… slurping sounds. That's all I know.
Geralt|Hm. Doesn't sound like a major necrophage or a pack of drowners…
Shani|No, this was one "thing" - big, but one. Somebody threw a torch at it. Monster couldn't have cared less.
Geralt|All right, not afraid of fire. Good to know.
Geralt|The soldier… he someone important to you?
Shani|His name was Nols. Supposed to go on leave next week. Now he won't - nor will the rest of his unit.
Geralt|How many were they?
Shani|A whole squad, six brave boys. All dead.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Soldiers from your escort?
Shani|Yes, that's them. Vern, Miklas… poor boys.
Geralt|Beast doesn't play around, apparently.
Shani|They saved my life…
Geralt|Gotta look around.
Geralt|Man you patched up - is he here?
Shani|Franz? I don't see him. Think the monster might've dragged him off?
Geralt|Could have.
Geralt|Hm. Beast probably crawled in or… out through here.
Geralt|It's deep.
Shani|Lower level of the sewers has been closed off for years. But Vern, the commander, had a skeleton key.
Geralt|See if I can't find it.
Geralt|What exactly happened?
Shani|We came in here and Miklas started looking for tracks. Then drowners attacked.
Shani|The men made quick work of them, but Franz was injured. His leg. He and I stayed behind, I tried to bandage him up, while Nols stood watch.
Shani|Then that beast appeared. Nols pushed me towards the exit and ran at the monster.
Shani|I turned around and saw him lying there, covered in a sticky substance. I ran back to get him, then dragged him to where you found us.
Geralt|Where was the monster?
Shani|Miklas and Vern had driven it away from us. And paid dearly for it.
Geralt|Manage to get a look at what attacked you?
Shani|Everything happened so fast. I didn't get a good look, no - only saw it from behind. I know it was large and… slimy.
Geralt|Know them well?
Shani|Him I met this morning. But Vern and I served together at the Battle of Dorian.
Shani|Miklas only enlisted this Yule.
Geralt|Sorry.
Shani|Once you kill this beast, we'll have to send someone down here to collect their bodies. Give them a proper burial.
Geralt|Fresh bruises on the bodies. From a blunt, heavy object.
Shani|And no cuts.
Geralt|Mhm. A few scratches. And everyone's covered in the same strange slime…
Geralt|Interesting. See that wet spot on the ground?
Shani|Mhm. It leads into that channel.
Geralt|Monster must've come in through there. And left the same way.
Shani|Any idea what might've killed them?
Geralt|Not yet. For now, my bet's on something big. A zeugl, maybe.
Geralt|Need to find its lair.
<|endoftext|>
Shani|Hideous creatures.
Geralt|You all right?
Shani|Mh. Fine.
Shani|Look, it's Franz.
Geralt|What's left of him, you mean.
Shani|What kind of beast would do that?
Geralt|Doubt we'll learn anything else here. We need to find the lair.
Shani|Right behind you.
Geralt|Hm. Interesting.
Shani|What?
Geralt|Franz had a leg wound, right?
Shani|Mhm, just above the knee.
Geralt|Manage to apply anything to it?
Shani|Yes, some spirit, but that was it. Why do you ask?
Geralt|Look - half of Franz's leg is gone. Monster must've chewed it off.
Geralt|Other bodies were untouched. Except for the wounds they sustained in battle.
Shani|Are you suggesting… the beast likes alcohol?
Geralt|Mhm. Mixed with blood.
Geralt|Hmm. Lotta drowners.
Shani|Does that mean anything?
Geralt|Well, means our monster doesn't attack them.
Geralt|Seems they get along with whatever's prowling the sewers. Some kind of symbiosis.
Shani|Geralt! Are you all right?
Geralt|I'm fine. You? How'd you get in here?
Shani|I told you. Vern had a key to the grate.
Shani|I squeezed through those bars.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Legend going around about this monster being a prince turned into a toad. A curse or something.
Shani|I've heard. A lot of women have fallen for it.
Shani|I find out who started that rumor? I'll strangle them.
Geralt|So, don't believe it?
Shani|I studied medicine, not literature. I stopped believing in fairytales long ago.
Geralt|When did you get pressed into service?
Shani|As soon as war broke out.
Shani|First they had me patching up folk at the Battle of Dorian, then at Vizima, and finally in Velen.
Geralt|Been to those battlefields. Must've been tough.
Shani|It's war. Severed limbs, blood and guts.
Shani|Remember, I learned how to operate under Milo "Rusty" Vanderbeck, at the Battle of Brenna.
Shani|Graduates of his school can handle anything.
Geralt|Shani, watch out! Move!
Geralt|Strange. Drowners' bodies are covered in slime.
Shani|Hm, must've run into the beast, just like the soldiers.
Geralt|We have to find its lair. Need to hurry.
Shani|Geralt! This way!
Geralt|Beginning to doubt this is a zeugl…
Shani|What else is that large and lives in sewers?
Geralt|Dunno… Maybe a giant toad?
Shani|Mhm. Right.
Geralt|Hear that? Think that's the beast.
Shani|The noise seems to be coming from the other side of this wall.
Geralt|Body's covered in the same strange slime.
Geralt|Swelling on much of the body. Blows from a large, blunt object.
Geralt|Monster must've emerged from this tunnel. Then fled the same way.
Shani|Geralt, wait! We haven't finished yet!
Shani|Don't leave me here!
Shani|Oh, I was worried you'd gone off on your own.
Geralt|A woman. Must've come here hoping to find her prince.
Geralt|Another unfortunate romantic. Came to lift a prince's curse, found a hideous death instead.
Geralt|Grating's badly bent. Something large struck it, with a lot of momentum.
Shani|I shut it as I fled. The monster must've slammed into it.
Geralt|Glad it held up. Though now we need to find a way around it.
Shani|Is it worth searching outside?
Geralt|Actually, just hoping the monster's blow weakened one of the walls.
Geralt|Careful. Monster might still be here.
Geralt|Got the key.
Shani|Good, let's get going.
Shani|Geralt! Are you all right?
Geralt|I'm fine!
Shani|I can't get down this way! I'll look for something else!
Geralt|Be careful!
Geralt|*Sniff sniff* Hm, odd smell. Blend of alcohol, blood and monster stench. Must've come through here.
Geralt|Monster left via this tunnel.
Shani|We'll never make it through there. Need to find another way.
Geralt|Can't say I envy him. Horrible way to die.
Geralt|Dead drowners everywhere.
Shani|Strange. Seemed the monster tolerated them.
Geralt|Long as they don't get too close, I guess.
Geralt|Lair's gotta be nearby.
Geralt|Shani, watch out!
Geralt|Loads of slime here. Enough for your sample?
Shani|It'd be more than enough if it wasn't contaminated.
Geralt|Shani, can you get your sample here?
Shani|Sure. Along with a bunch of dirt, rubble, and drowner droppings.
Shani|I need a clean sample. From the lair - that'd be best.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Decaying corpses, slime everywhere, and that stench - this has to be the lair.
Geralt|Fresh and moist. Beast was just here.
Shani|I'll collect my sample.
Geralt|Hm. All the tunnels and corridors converge here.
Shani|What now?
Geralt|Got any more of that spirit you used on Franz's wound?
Shani|Sure, here. What do you want to do?
Geralt|Make some bait. Lure the beast.
Shani|I hope you don't plan to cut yourself, or--
Geralt|Relax. Plenty of bodies. I'll use one of them.
Geralt|I'll get to work.
Shani|Hm. I doubt I'd be much help in the fight, but you might need me afterwards. I'll look for a hiding place.
Geralt|You'd be better off waiting for me up top… or back home.
Shani|But--
Geralt|No buts.
Geralt|Wait in the passage for now if you have to. Though I'd rather you didn't. But when the monster shows, you run for the surface.
Shani|Ugh, fine…
Geralt|Shani, look at me. Promise you'll stay out of it.
Shani|I promise.
Geralt|Good. Now go hide.
Shani|Be careful, Geralt.
Geralt|Sample you collected enough?
Shani|Hope so. But I'd still like to get some pure venom… once you've killed the monster.
Geralt|To distill an antidote? No use for it once the beast's dead.
Shani|Not true. I have a few poisoned patients on hand. Besides, I can study the venom, test it, maybe discover some interesting properties.
Geralt|Need to lure the beast.
Shani|How? We don't even know what kind of monster it is.
Geralt|But we do know it likes a blend of blood and liquor. Just so happens I've got some alcohol on me.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Wha… what's going on?
Oxenfurt Prisoner|Ah, he's finally come to. And he can speak human, turns out.
Oxenfurt Prisoner|Started thinkin' I'd not converse in Common the whole way. 'Cept maybe with me reflection in the piss bucket.
Geralt|Where… where am I?
Oxenfurt Prisoner|On the "Albatross." Or the "Phakbarthojl," as their strange tongue has it. En route to Ofier.
Geralt|Don't remember signing on as a sailor.
Oxenfurt Prisoner|Haha, oh, you didn't, mate. They dragged you aboard. Seems you killed their prince.
Geralt|Dammit. Don't remember a thing. Just some sewers, a giant toad, then some boots…
Geralt|If that toad was their prince, guess I'm lucky to be alive.
Oxenfurt Prisoner|Depends how you look at it.
Oxenfurt Prisoner|Happen to know a bit of Ofieri. Heard them sayin' they'd come here on a mission. Dispatched by their king to find their prince, lift his curse.
Oxenfurt Prisoner|Wagered their honor - and that of their families five generations back - that they'd bring him home, safe and sound.
Geralt|And I killed him. Great.
Geralt|So, must think they can save their honor by bringing the prince's murderer back - to face the king's justice.
Geralt|Tried to break out yet?
Oxenfurt Prisoner|Beh! Used every ounce of charm I got, and nothin' doin'. Might be my Ofieri's rusty.
Geralt|My Ofieri's non-existent.
Oxenfurt Prisoner|Well, we'll be at sea at least a month. Could teach you some in that time.
Hakland Solider 01|Elkhahl! Ohrijahle!
Geralt|What's that mean?
Oxenfurt Prisoner|Told us to shut up.
Geralt|There's been a misunderstanding. Can I talk to your captain?
Hakland Soldier 02|Elkhahl, sokhan. Ghalaveth kharh u albahta a'ghell.
Oxenfurt Prisoner|Quiet, dog. You killed our prince and you'll pay for that.
Hakland Soldier 02|Gyhle'am vallarh, quar verrethe ner.
Oxenfurt Prisoner|Were it up to me, you'd be dead already.
Hakland Solider 01|Revhaghr ner'am ea kharher, Annar. Dhorgatte ye'allami.
Oxenfurt Prisoner|Vengeance is not ours to reap, Annar. It's the king's. We swore on our honor.
Geralt|How do I say "Take me to your captain"?
Oxenfurt Prisoner|Vhajlth alle'khe uhl eghullath.
Geralt|What?
Hakland Solider 01|Elkhahl!
Geralt|V… Vhajlth…
Geralt|Vhajlth… alle'khe yhll eghallith!
Oxenfurt Prisoner|That you wanted his auntie's hat. That was the gist, anyroad.
Geralt|Great.
Oxenfurt Prisoner|Give it a rest. No point talkin' to that lot. All you get's angry gurgles. And they puff up, you notice? Like them fish, uh, what's it they're called…?
Geralt|There anyone here who speaks Common?
Oxenfurt Prisoner|Uh, there's this mercenary with them. Looks Aedirnian to me. He's the one recruited me to show 'em through the sewers.
Oxenfurt Prisoner|Oh, and the mage what leads them knows a bit. Heard him talkin'. But I doubt either'll talk to you.
Oxenfurt Prisoner|Ah, I was you I'd catch some shut-eye, not go on flappin' me tongue. Got a long voyage ahead.
Geralt|Sleep's not what I need. Someone I could actually communicate with, that's what I want.
Mirror|Greetings, Geralt. Remember me?
Geralt|I remember. We met in White Orchard. You're…
Mirror|Gaunter O'Dimm, known also as Master Mirror. I helped you find your… Yennefer.
Mirror|We meet again. And it seems you need my help. Again. Heard a noose awaits you.
Mirror|That is… if this slop doesn't kill you first.
Geralt|Haven't tried it yet.
Mirror|Hm. Doesn't look promising. Not unlike your situation. I could try to extract you from here, you know.
Mirror|Because you do wish to disembark, do you not?
Geralt|Yeah, sure. But what on earth could you--?
Mirror|Oh, more than you'd ever expect. I shall help you, Geralt. But before I do, I must know you'll return the favor.
Geralt|Right. Can't possibly get something for nothing.
Mirror|Indeed. When all's said and done I am a merchant. So, do you want my help?
Geralt|Yes.
Mirror|It's a deal. Once it's all over, we shall meet at midnight at the crossroads 'neath the willows near the village of Yantra.
Mirror|Ah, and I must give you something - to remember me by.
Geralt|Ssss! What's that?
Mirror|A mark to show we're… associates.
Oxenfurt Prisoner|Who you gabbin' with?
Geralt|Wi-- No one.
Oxenfurt Prisoner|Ah, never liked boats. Not one bit.
Oxenfurt Prisoner|They heave like devils, make me stomach churn.
Oxenfurt Prisoner|Ah, it'd be prime to sleep through the whole thing and wa--
Geralt|How'd you get in here?
Mirror|Long story, it'd bore you. I'd prefer to focus on something more useful - like getting you off this ship.
Geralt|Not really.
Mirror|Gaunter O'Dimm, known also as Master Mirror. We met in White Orchard - I helped you find your… Yennefer.
Geralt|Vhajlth… alle'ghe urh yghilleth!
Oxenfurt Prisoner|Heh. Along the lines of "I want your nose bouncy-bouncy!". Utter nonsense.
Geralt|Vhajlth… all'khe uhl eghullath!
Geralt|And who might you be?
Oxenfurt Prisoner|Phelippe Calagrande at your service. Petty thief, professional fence, and your guide about Oxenfurt when I've a bit of time.
Geralt|Mhm. And why're you here? You kill a prince, too?
Oxenfurt Prisoner|Well, to their thinkin', I had a hand in this one's death. See, I was their guide. Led them down into the sewers, but not until after you'd cut their prince's gut open.
Geralt|Sorry about that.
Oxenfurt Prisoner|Not your fault, mate. When all's said and done, could've sat on me arse in the Alchemy playin' gwent. Didn't have to brag about knowin' Oxenfurt better than me own breeches.
Geralt|We been at sea long?
Oxenfurt Prisoner|Hmm, dunno, rightly. Not that long. Though, on the other hand… But what's it matter, anyroad?
Geralt|Matters a lot. If they're hauling me off to hang me, I'm not in a hurry to arrive.
Oxenfurt Prisoner|Me, I'm glad to be sailin' to Ofier. I hear they got wild horses there, white with black stripes. Always wanted to see one o' them.
Geralt|Sure they're not black horses with white stripes?
Oxenfurt Prisoner|Nay, black horses with white stripes they've got in Zanguebar. That I'm sure of.
Geralt|Listen, there was a young woman, a medic. Red hair. They capture her too?
Oxenfurt Prisoner|Don't recall seeing anyone of the sort. You were alone.
Geralt|Good. Means she managed to flee. Hopefully made it home.
Geralt|Oooh… Toad in the sewers. Dammit.
Geralt|Should consider myself lucky, I guess. Coulda killed me on the spot.
Hakland Solider 01|Elkhahl! Inhkal avr ikhell urgherevng aul vihter.
Hakland Solider 01|Insh'avahl kho llayath.
Oxenfurt Prisoner|And then he added something like, "We'll see who's in the mood for jokes, then."
Geralt|Why? What did I say?
Geralt|What just happened? What'd he say?
Oxenfurt Prisoner|Said to sit quiet. And that you'll hang in two weeks.

<|endoftext|>
Aedrin Soldier|Didn't bargain for no storm. Afeared that means a tidy jump in my fee.
Hakland Mage|To Ofier get us safely. The king's reward will be generous.
Aedrin Soldier|What about the prisoner?
Hakland Mage|Before the king we must bring him. On doing so my honor relies.
Aedrin Soldier|Can't we just bring your king the bastard's head? Like we're doin' with the other?
Hakland Mage|The other drowned. We could do nothing. We deliver live this one.
Hakland Mage|Apart from all else, the hell the king is sure to condemn him to, I wish to see it.
Aedrin Soldier|What kind of hell?
Hakland Mage|Tarring, flaying and quartering - this the punishment for regicide entails.
<|endoftext|>
Mirror|I knew you'd come.
Geralt|You a soothsayer?
Mirror|It matters little who I am. Your escape, I made it possible. Previously, Yennefer, you found her thanks to me. So you feel you owe me.
Geralt|Memento you gave me - pretty effective reminder.
Mirror|That is its purpose.
Mirror|Incidentally, I find it quite funny how even the most rotten scoundrels have this inner compunction to repay "debts of gratitude."
Mirror|Humans, elves, dwarves… all races. You really must explain that to me… one day.
Mirror|As for the here and now - tell me, how'd you manage with the Ofieris?
Geralt|Well, can't say I remember you helping me that much. Storm broke out, ship smashed into some rocks.
Mirror|Is that what you believe? You're more a die-hard rationalist than I thought.
Mirror|Hm. So it's not gratitude that's brought you here. Which must mean curiosity's done the job. Mm, I adore that trait. It gives birth to so many fascinating tales.
Geralt|And the tale you so clearly want to tell me - what's that about?
Mirror|It's about a man worse than most. A vulgar, despicable man with a heart of stone. A man who refuses to pay his debts.
Geralt|Really think this'll interest me? Any reason why?
Mirror|He's wronged you as well. His name is Olgierd von Everec.
Geralt|What'd he do to you?
Mirror|Before I reveal this, I'd like to make one thing very clear.
Mirror|Olgierd von Everec did willfully and maliciously conspire to cause you to kill a man who might have been cured. Had I not intervened, you would have lost your head for this.
Mirror|Do you know why he did it? Because he's a degenerate monster in human flesh who feeds on the pain and suffering of others.
Geralt|Well, you clearly don't like him. What'd he do to you?
Mirror|He and I made a pact. A pact under which I called on my many talents and associates to give him what he desired.
Mirror|And now the time's come to pay, yet he shirks his obligation.
Geralt|Need me to collect a debt? I'm not some hired muscle.
Mirror|Muscle is not what this requires. It needs a soul intelligent and clever, an individual who fears no dare. Someone like you.
Geralt|Pure flattery, that.
Mirror|Of course it is! After all, I am a traveling merchant. But make no mistake, I've many interesting wares on offer.
Geralt|Wares like…?
Mirror|Surfeit, abundance for the body and soul. You will lack neither food nor drink. As a witcher you might desire weapons supreme - I can offer you those you've dreamt of.
Mirror|Your body - agile as never before. Your mind - faster than lightning. Romantic prowess to charm all womankind. But above all I offer a great and true adventure, an experience like no other, the fate of only the chosen few.
Geralt|Sure sounds generous. And all that for my help with one small matter? Won't want anything else from me?
Mirror|Just one. Honesty.
Geralt|What about you? Call yourself a man of many talents - can't you take care of this?
Mirror|Therein lies the catch. Our pact states that before I can collect my due, I must yet fulfill three wishes for von Everec.
Mirror|But I cannot fulfill them myself, directly, making use instead of a… hmm… how shall I put it… a proxy.
Geralt|Mhm. So what you need's a sucker.
Mirror|What I need is an ally. And something tells me I shall find none better than you.
Geralt|What do you expect me to do?
Mirror|To start with, join me in paying von Everec a visit. Then, well… then we shall improvise.
Mirror|I believe, however, that all will end well. And once it does, we three shall meet and thank one another for the voyage we shared.
Geralt|Right. Specifics, now. Thought Olgierd had three wishes… requests… whatever.
Mirror|He does. He may ask three things of us. Yet we won't know what they are until we see him.
Geralt|Fine. I'll go see Olgierd with you, but no promises.
Mirror|That is all I ask.
Geralt|Now remove the damn mark.
Mirror|Naturally. Just as soon as you complete your task.
Mirror|Go, you will not regret it. We shall meet there. I've a matter to attend to along the way.
Geralt|Another debt to collect?
Mirror|Perhaps.
Geralt|Sorry, have to find yourself someone else. I'm not about to help you.
Mirror|Don't be so hasty to decide. Olgierd von Everec is a truly base and vile man.
Mirror|Go to him, see for yourself.
Geralt|Just what do you think I'll see?
Mirror|All you need to. Things that will make you change your mind - I guarantee it. Besides which, help me in this, and I shall rid you of that unsavory mark. Not to mention all the other rewards that could be yours…
Mirror|Go. I shall join you later.
Geralt|Uh, all seems a little shady. Your help, your pact with Olgierd, his three… requests…
Mirror|Think it over. I agree, you've no a priori reason to trust me.
Mirror|But as it happens, I was in the right place at the right time to help you. And it's also the case that the same man has wronged us both. To my mind those are reasons to work together.
Geralt|To my mind, not so much.
Mirror|Come with me to see Olgierd. You shall see he's a vile, dishonorable man who treats the lives of all folk like playthings.
Mirror|As he treated yours when he sent you to find the frog-prince.
Geralt|What'd you do for Olgierd? Break him out of a cell, too?
Mirror|In some sense, yes. I remember that day quite well… There was a light drizzle, yet the cold tore right through you.
Mirror|Olgierd appeared at the break of dawn - gaunt as a rail, his shirt moth-eaten. Seemed to have naught but the sword at his side. It quite pained me to look at him.
Mirror|He asked for help, and help I gave. Made him a rich man, successful, esteemed. He is who he is today thanks only to me.
Mirror|Yet afterwards he turned his back, shunned me. Sends me off when I dare ask for payment - even sicced his hounds on me once.
Mirror|He's thus left me no option but to invoke the terms of our pact. And that is where you come in.
Geralt|Hm. How much does he owe you?
Mirror|Gentlemen don't discuss coin.
Geralt|Need to know the details if you want me to get my hands dirty. How much? A million crowns? Two million?
Mirror|I'm no usurer to lend coin for interest.
Mirror|No, what Olgierd owes me is far more personal than shiny things that clink.
Mirror|As much as I regret it, I can say no more. I must respect his privacy.
Geralt|Know what? This business, it's between you two. Rather not get involved.
Mirror|Before you decide, please hear me out. You shall see Olgierd is a vile man.
Mirror|Or, as they say in the west: a real son of a whore.
Geralt|How'd you know we'd met? And that I'm not exactly thrilled with him now?
Mirror|Please, Geralt. I knew the Ofieri had captured you - was I not to know how this had come to pass?
Geralt|Don't know why he's on your shit list, but I've got no quarrel with him.
Mirror|I believe you do, but have yet to realize it.
Geralt|Thanks for your help, really. but you could've chosen more conventional means. Given me the key to my cell, for instance.
Mirror|Oh my, far too simple. I dislike simple solutions. Do you like them?
Geralt|Doubt we're here to talk about my preferences.
Mirror|True. I'd much rather tell you about an individual of interest to us both.
Geralt|You appeared out of nowhere, disappeared just as mysteriously, summoned a storm… Lemme guess - you're a mage.
Mirror|Please, no. I cannot stand spells.
Mirror|Childish hocus-pocus, it's just not interesting. What I find fascinating are true tales of true human lives. Like the one I shall tell you now.
Mirror|Must say I'm surprised.
Geralt|By what?
Mirror|We were to meet at the crossroads, yet you show up here.
Geralt|Frankly, I was afraid you'd give me another memento.
Mirror|Hm. Interesting. I helped you find Yennefer, then I made possible your escape, so you ought to feel grateful. Even the worst scum feel an inner compunction to repay their "debts of gratitude" - but not you.
Geralt|I was subjected to mutations. Stripped me of all kinds of human compunctions.
Mirror|Hm. Interesting bit of information. We shall have to discuss it at length later.
Mirror|For now, you must tell me how you managed with the Ofieris.
Mirror|Go on. You'll not regret it.
Geralt|What about you?
Mirror|I… I prefer to follow, remain in the shadows.
Geralt|Love to continue this chat, but something's on fire over there.
Mirror|So?
Geralt|Going over there. Maybe I can help.
Mirror|Ah, at least twenty pairs of hands there already. One more pair of witcher's mitts will make no difference, I assure you.
Mirror|Instead, why not stay and tell me how things went on the ship?
<|endoftext|>
Olgierd Bandit 02|Well, look who's here! The witcher with the fists o' steel! What's new?
Olgierd Bandit 02|Got a growth on your platter, there. You catch some kind of Ofieri pox?
Geralt|Could say so.
Geralt|Manor's burning - you noticed?
Olgierd Bandit 02|That? Oh, right. You know how it is - feast drags on with plenty o' dancin', merry-makin', rough play, hehe. We got a bit carried away, truth be told.
Geralt|Plain to see. Where's Olgierd?
Olgierd Bandit 02|Damned if I know. Must be somewhere hereabouts.
Olgierd Bandit 04|No, please! I beg you!
Olgierd Bandit 03|Shut your trap!
Olgierd Bandit 04|Lemme go! Leave me be!
Olgierd Bandit Female 01|Shut it!
Olgierd Bandit 04|I ate with youse, drank with youse, fought beside youse! And you'd kill me now? I'm one of youse!
Olgierd Bandit 03|You might've been. But not no more you ain't.
Geralt|What's he guilty of?
Olgierd Bandit Female 01|What the fuck's it to you?! Not your concern, mate!
Geralt|Whoa, nerves a little raw? Why?
Olgierd Bandit Female 01|You deaf? Get the fuck out of here, freak!
Geralt|All I want is to know what exactly's going on here.
Olgierd Bandit 03|Well you're not gonna know! Sod off!
Geralt|I'll leave soon as you tell me.
Olgierd Bandit Female 01|Aren't you a thorny prick up the arse!
Olgierd Bandit Female 01|Ataman said to kill him!
Olgierd Bandit 03|Got your answer. Happy? Now piss off. We've work to do!
Geralt|Wait. I know Olgierd wants him dead. Still don't know why, though.
Olgierd Bandit 03|Just what the fuck is it to you, anyhow?
Geralt|Nothing, really. Just curious.
Olgierd Bandit Female 01|Cocksucker violated our chivalric code! Just one penalty for that - death!
Olgierd Bandit 04|Aaargh!
Olgierd|What is this row?
Olgierd|Are you not done with him? My ears wither from the screams!
Olgierd|Ah, Geralt. As you've returned, might I assume you've cleared the sewers?
Olgierd|Or have you not been there?
Girl Victim|You killed my father!
Olgierd|Not I.
Girl Victim|You lie, whoreson!
Olgierd|That man killed him - alone, unbeknownst to me. Out of fury, for your father refused us hospitality. For this willful violation of the chivalric code, he was summarily executed himself.
Olgierd|Anythin' else I might do for you?
Olgierd|Take her away.
Olgierd|Now where were we?
Geralt|Really necessary - that whole show?
Olgierd|Beh, "show"? Come, now.
Olgierd|A man must display some madness from time to time - helps him feel alive.
Olgierd|Daresay you know what I mean - judging by the mark on your face.
Geralt|Killed the beast in the sewers.
Olgierd|Congratulations are in order, then. Your reward. You're also welcome to take what you wish from the manor house - if anything's left uncharred, that is.
Olgierd|Was it a tough fight?
Geralt|I sliced its gut open, and it turned into a man. You know that would happen?
Mirror|Of course he did. He'd never have dragged you into this elsewise.
Olgierd|Gaunter O'Dimm. Come to cast aspersions?
Mirror|No. I've come to collect a debt.
Olgierd|You know you first must--
Mirror|Grant you three requests… by proxy. I present to you my champion - Geralt of Rivia.
Geralt|Not so fast. Haven't agreed to anything yet.
Mirror|But you'll do it, of that I'm certain. Did you know Olgierd was the one to turn the Ofieri prince into a toad?
Mirror|Did he not mention that bit? Well, then allow me to tell it. Quite the gripping story.
Mirror|Olgierd once loved a beautiful maiden named Iris. Yet her parents chose to offer her hand to the crown prince of Ofier. Olgierd grew to hate the poor sot.
Mirror|At first, he wished to kill him, then decided this would be too simple. So instead, he condemned the prince to a base life in a toad's bloated corpus.
Mirror|Yet he grew bored of watching him suffer and decided to end it. By your hand.
Olgierd|Remind me, O'Dimm - who is to fulfill my last three requests?
Mirror|My assistant. Geralt.
Olgierd|Then begone. I don't wish to look at your face any longer than I must.
Olgierd|Come.
Geralt|Where to?
Olgierd|The stables. My men are preparing to depart.
Geralt|Guess I gotta pop the question directly - what do I need to do for you?
Olgierd|Hmmm, let me think.
Olgierd|We're currently without a roof over our heads. Perhaps we should start with that. Bring me the house of Maximilian Borsodi.
Geralt|His house?
Olgierd|So surprised - but why? I must live somewhere, mustn't I?
Olgierd|What's the meanin' of this?! Taken leave of your senses? You mean to mount a filthy horse?!
Olgierd|Out of my sight, wretch! Know what Vlodimir would do to you if he saw?
Olgierd Bandit 01|Aye.
Geralt|Vlodimir?
Olgierd|My brother. There were times he himself stank like foot wrappings three days old, but his mount always looked fit for a parade.
Olgierd|Oh, none rival Vlodimir at feasting, carousing. Sadly, he's been celebrating less of late… You must find him and show him the time of his life. My second request.
Geralt|Fine, seems easy enough. And the third?
Olgierd|Complete those two, then we shall speak of the third.
Geralt|Once I'm done - with those two - where will I find you?
Olgierd|I cannot know as my band has planned some diversions. But let us say at the Alchemy Inn. In Oxenfurt.
Geralt|Fine. See you there.
Geralt|The brother shouldn't be too hard, but the house? How'm I supposed to bring him a house?
Mirror|Actually, the opposite. I wouldn't worry about the house. The brother will be the tough bit.
Geralt|Ugh. Guess it's high time I got to work.
Mirror|A bit more enthusiasm, witcher. You know you just might enjoy yourself.
Geralt|Yay. Can't wait.
Geralt|Say I need help - where'll I find you?
Mirror|I shall find you.
Mirror|Good luck, Geralt.
Geralt|Olgierd's brother - why do you think he'll be tough?
Mirror|I'm afraid he's dead. Has been for years.
Geralt|Ugh… never agreed to necromancy.
Mirror|Necromancy is hardly your only option for reviving a soul. An old-fashioned ritual, a Blood Summoning - that's what you need.
Geralt|That's like choosing between pestilence and the plague. 'Sides, I'd need the blood of the summoned.
Mirror|Blood - true. Of the summoned - not necessarily. Here.
Geralt|Where'd you get this?
Mirror|Geralt, Geralt, Geralt - aren't you the curious one. Assume it to be von Everec blood and get on with it.
Geralt|Mhh, where'll I find this Vlodimir?
Mirror|Geralt, I cannot do everything for you. Use your head.
Mirror|The von Everecs are well-known in these parts. You must have met someone who's heard of the family.
Mirror|The charming redhead, for instance - the medic. You know the one.
Geralt|Borsodi's house - no idea how I'm supposed to bring him that.
Mirror|Hm, the only Borsodi I know of around here runs an auction house in Oxenfurt.
Geralt|Heard of it. My swords almost got auctioned off there once. Auction was held in Novigrad, though it was a while past.
Mirror|They must have relocated. You just might get an opportunity to ask them why.
Geralt|Fine, I'll go there. Then what?
Mirror|How should I know? Perhaps you'll get inspired once you're there.
Mirror|Oh, and take plenty of coin. I've a feeling it could come in handy.
Geralt|You waited for me. Nice of you.
Mirror|I could hardly abandon my proxy to the whims of fate.
Geralt|Thought I have to fulfill Olgierd's wishes myself.
Mirror|So states the contract. Yet nowhere does it forbid me from providing help.
Mirror|And something tells me you'll need quite a bit to complete the first two tasks.
Geralt|Any hints? Where I should go? How I might start?
Olgierd|You must be mad. I've no intention to make things easier for you.
Geralt|This… thing between you and Master Mirror, your quarrel - really rather not get involved.
Olgierd|You already are, I fear. He did something for you. Now you've a debt to repay. Am I right?
Geralt|Yes.
Olgierd|Well, then you'll not free yourself of him till you've paid it back. But never worry, I shall devise tasks so impossible you will never complete them, not if you go mad trying.
Olgierd|But try your best and your debt shall be absolved, while I shall live in peace until Master Mirror finds another "aide-de-camp."
Geralt|What he said about the prince - that true? You turn him into a toad?
Olgierd|Perhaps - or perhaps the Ofieri dauphin ate somethin' that disagreed with him. You never know with their cuisine.
Geralt|Never heard of food that turns men into monsters.
Olgierd|Then perhaps it was somethin' he drank.
Geralt|Hrm.
Olgierd|Ah, I cast the curse. Revenge for a deep disappointment. I was another man, then. Let rage get the better of me and hollered the words without ever thinkin' they could possibly come true.
Geralt|Could've told me the truth about the toad. Having a bit of fun at my expense?
Olgierd|I simply wanted the beast dead. I could not know you would respond to the notice. Pure coincidence.
Olgierd|Yet I must admit - when you, a witcher, answered the call, I thought it right. It's what you lot are trained to do.
Geralt|Might've been able to lift the curse.
Olgierd|Perhaps, perhaps not. Then again - why bother?
Geralt|He was a human being.
Olgierd|That bloody Ofieri mutt was no human. His kind does not deserve to live.
Geralt|That true? You know the toad was a cursed prince?
Mirror|He didn't just know - he brought about the curse himself.
Geralt|You're… immortal?
Olgierd|Depends on your understanding of the term. Indeed, I cannot be killed.
Olgierd|But it's not at all what folk imagine. Not dying does not mean eternally living your life to the full.
Geralt|So it's a curse?
Olgierd|A curse? No, wouldn't call it that. I'll put it this way - you must be careful what you wish for lest your wish be granted. For there are consequences.
Geralt|Not sure I follow.
Olgierd|You know very little can hurt you, so you take wild risks, chase extreme sensations. There comes a point you've done it all, and all seems boring and monotonous.
Olgierd|The trick's to plough through that moment, go further, reach beyond what's known as possible.
Geralt|Know what this is?
Olgierd|I cannot be certain, but I've my suspicions.
Olgierd|That's a dangerous man you've chosen to deal with, witcher.
Geralt|Can't help wondering… man whose life I just saved - what was his crime?
Olgierd|He slew the lass's father, the lord of the manor.
Olgierd|Bloke joined our band recently. Quick to draw his blade, eager to fight.
Olgierd|When we arrived, I made it plain - we'd arrived as guests. And as such, we would treat our hosts with honor.
Olgierd|But the hosts would not have us. My company responded with ire, and the man you saved finally killed the master of the house.
Olgierd|The chivalric code knows but one punishment for his crime.
Geralt|No, you don't. Let him go.
Olgierd Bandit Female 01|Oh, this is bloody rich! Can't ploughin' believe me ears! You switch your brains with your cock, or somethin'?
Olgierd Bandit Female 01|Get your mutant witcher arse out of here!
Geralt|Or?
Olgierd Bandit 03|Or I'll kill ye!
Geralt|Go ahead, try.
Olgierd|Whoa, whoa! What the bloody hell's this?!
Olgierd|Geralt. Have you decided to play defender of the downtrodden?
Geralt|More like gutter of sons of bitches.
Olgierd|Long as I'm here, you'll gut no one.
Geralt|That a challenge?
Olgierd|Why not. I've not fought a witcher before. Defeat me, and I shall let him go.
Olgierd|Stand aside!
Olgierd|Would you wait, sir, for the dribble to subside?
Geralt|Makes no difference to me.
Olgierd|Justly said. Stand and fight!
Geralt|Understood. Well, do what you have to. Not about to interfere.
Olgierd Bandit 03|Gods, finally.
Olgierd Bandit 04|No, please! Save me, help me!
Olgierd Bandit Female 01|Told you to shut your gob!
Geralt|Tell you what's gonna happen now.
Geralt|I'll ask again, polite like, and you'll answer, just as politely.
Olgierd Bandit 03|And if I don't?
Geralt|Then I'll get angry, stop talking, and slaughter you all like swine. So what'll it be?
Geralt|Am I gonna hear why you want to take his head… or not?
Olgierd Bandit 02|Well, look who's here! The witcher with a stick up his arse! What's new?
Olgierd|Well struck, witcher. You win.
Olgierd|But perhaps you'd care to tell me why you meddled in a matter not yours?
Geralt|Wanted… to prevent… further bloodshed.
Olgierd|Well, well… The witcher with the heart of gold.
Olgierd|Unsavory as it seems, there is a silver lining - at least you now know I don't easily lose my head.
Olgierd|Release him.
Olgierd Bandit 03|Gettin' off cheap, mate.
Geralt|Shame to die in this rain.
Olgierd|A witcher shall soon be buried. The skies weep.
Olgierd|Witcher, sir, you flail your blade like a peasant.
<|endoftext|>
Redanian Soldier 01|Figured out at long last what's puttin' the pus in our men's wounds, makin' 'em fester?
Shani|An infection.
Redanian Soldier 01|Care to elaborate, madame medic? Here's a matter of grave concern to the Redanian Army, which I represent.
Shani|Septicemia usually begins in the mucous membranes, digestive tract, genitourinary system or simply on the skin.
Shani|In this case, we're dealing with a dermal invasion resulting in toxins entering the body.
Redanian Soldier 01|A, err… wha?
Shani|I've tested the slime samples. I believe I'll be able to brew an antidote.
Redanian Soldier 01|Good. A pox in an army can prove more ravaging than even the fiercest foe. Your service will be recognized.
Shani|How? Will I get a toad-shaped medal?
Redanian Soldier 01|The army's not got any medal like that.
Shani|Geralt? Are you all right? What's that on your face?
Geralt|Long story.
Redanian Soldier 01|Ahem.
Redanian Soldier 01|We're conductin' important business. Youse can catch up later.
Shani|Uh, yes. Right. I'll get to work on the antidote. Shouldn't take long.
Redanian Soldier 01|Tasty number, that medic. Not like a scholar at all.
Geralt|So, think learned women are ugly as a rule?
Redanian Soldier 01|Well, it's lucky they've brains, 'cause they've not got beauty .
Redanian Soldier 01|Ain't that right, lads?
Redanian Soldier 02|Oh, aye! Mutts, all of them.
Redanian Soldier 03|Hideous things. Wouldn't touch one with a ten-ell pole.
Redanian Soldier 04|But this lass is different. Exceptional.
Redanian Soldier 01|You're a lucky bastard, witcher. We've seen her makin' eyes at ye. Nowt like she looks at us. Ain't that right? Admit it… you fancy her, too, eh?
Geralt|It'd take a blind man to shrug and turn away.
Redanian Soldier 03|Too true! Meantime, you witchers've got especially sharp senses, heheh.
Shani|Here's the medicine. It's a strong solution, so careful with the dosage. Each patient gets exactly two drops after meals, three times a day. At the most in three, four days, the infection should recede.
Redanian Soldier 01|I thank you - in Redania's glorious name.
Geralt|Serving the Redanian cause now?
Shani|I serve individuals, I treat them. That they're Redanians is coincidental. I'd help Nilfgaardians as well, were I in a position to.
Shani|Kaedwenis, Aedirnian, elves, dwarves, halflings - the same. Come on, Geralt, you know me.
Geralt|Shani, I need your help this time.
Shani|I'd guessed this wasn't a social call. All right, tell me what you need.
Shani|Is it at all related to that mark on your face?
Shani|Ahh, and you must tell me what happened in the sewers!
Geralt|Long story.
Shani|Give me its essence.
Geralt|The essence? I'm deeply in debt. To a man named Gaunter O'Dimm.
Shani|Who's this?
Geralt|Met him a while back in White Orchard. At the time, he claimed he… dealt in mirrors.
Shani|Mirrors. Buy one from him that grants your wishes?
Geralt|Something like that.
Geralt|He helped me out of a bind. Now he expects me to fulfill some nobleman's wishes in return.
Geralt|First one's to summon the ghost of his brother, then show him the time of his life.
Shani|Amuse a ghost? How do you intend to do that?
Geralt|Not my chief concern at the moment. Gotta find his grave and summon him, first. Then we'll see.
Shani|But that's necromancy! It's extraordinarily risky and involves higher magic.
Geralt|O'Dimm told me how to do it - no sorceress or necromancy involved.
Geralt|Gave me this… concoction that summons ghosts. I'll need a censer, too.
Shani|That can be arranged. They keep one in a storehouse at the academy. I can fetch it for you.
Geralt|Thanks.
Shani|Don't mention it. But I still don't like this…
Geralt|Neither do I. But I don't really have any options. Gotta summon that ghost.
Shani|I understand. Whose ghost is it?
Geralt|Olgierd von Everec's brother.
Shani|Von Everec? Hm.
Shani|In my third year at Oxenfurt we had to choose an elective. My options were "Pearls of Wisdom from the Hierarchs" or "Famous Redanian Dynasties."
Shani|I chose the latter.
Shani|Here it is!
Shani|Von Eyegrid… von Esteken… von Everec!
Shani|Hmmm. It says Olgierd had a brother named Vlodimir. He lies in the family crypt, near their manor.
Geralt|Thanks. Knew I could count on you. I'm off.
Shani|The crypt's described as quite a work of art. I'd love to see it. Why don't I bring the censer. We can meet at the entrance.
Geralt|Shani, please. No use complaining. Just help me.
Shani|I'm not complaining. I'm concerned.
Shani|Oh, fine. So whose ghost is it?
Geralt|Hm. Could be a mage, a demon… or a djinn.
Shani|You don't know?
Geralt|He's very powerful - that's all I need to know.
Geralt|Frankly? I don't really know…
Geralt|Hm, where do I start…
Geralt|All right. Monster in the sewers turned out to be a giant toad. And this toad was actually a prince - an Ofieri one, at that.
Shani|Mhm. And I'm a Koviri duchess.
Geralt|It's the truth, uncolored, I swear. When I killed the toad, some Ofieri soldiers led by a mage showed up. Captured me.
Geralt|Man named Gaunter O'Dimm freed me.
Geralt|Aside from the incident in the sewers, we last saw each other… hmm… must've been in Vizima.
Shani|Uh, yes, yes. When it was ravaged by the Catriona.
Geralt|Feels like a century ago. Where've you been? What've you been doing since?
Shani|Well, I left Vizima and returned to Oxenfurt. Proceeded to finish my doctorate and then opened a practice.
Shani|Shortly thereafter, war broke out, and I was press-ganged into the Redanian Medical Corps.
Geralt|Yeah, classic Radovid.
Shani|Can't complain, really. I've lived at home since the fighting subsided. Resumed my practice and simply treat the ill.
Shani|Though I must always be ready - for at any time the Redanians might knock with some painfully urgent assignment.
Geralt|So what now? Radovid's dead.
Shani|But the war's not over yet. The chaos continues, I'm still very much needed.
Shani|Though I can't complain. At least I live at home, now - and I treat the ill, as is my calling.
Geralt|There's no denying her beauty, but… she's not my type.
Redanian Soldier 02|Bah. Talkin' out your arse, mate.
Redanian Soldier 03|Passin' on quite the catch. She looked at me like she does you, I'd not dally long thinkin'.
Geralt|Sorry, none of your business.
Redanian Soldier 02|C'mon! This some kind of secret? You embarrassed?
Redanian Soldier 02|She's quite fetchin', and you're… well, none too handsome, but a witcher. Lasses like your type.
Redanian Soldier 02|Come, now. Fess up, you fancy her or not?
Geralt|Interesting. Curious to know, what do scholars look like, to your mind?
Redanian Soldier 01|Err, well, all that readin's hard on the eyes, right? So they wear spectacles.
Redanian Soldier 02|Oh, aye. Thick ones, propped on wrinkled noses. And their clothin' - frumpy at best.
Redanian Soldier 03|Who've they got to dress up for? The books?
Geralt|Fascinating, really. But if I were you, I'd make sure no medic ever overhears you.
Redanian Soldier 01|Huh? Why's that?
Geralt|Because when you get cut in a battle, she might just refuse to stitch you back up.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Never seen this side of you.
Shani|What side is that?
Geralt|How do I put this… your romantic side? Used to seeing you surrounded by bandages and medicine vials. Often covered in blood.
Shani|That's because you usually come round while I'm at work. Off-duty, now, waiting for you, weaving a garland for the wedding.
Geralt|Didn't know you were getting married.
Shani|Not mine, silly. My friend's.
Shani|This garland's not for me.
Shani|Speaking of which… would you go with me?
Geralt|Sure, why not.
Shani|Wonderful. So… it's a date.
Geralt|Remember to bring the censer?
Shani|Of course. Some soldiers nearly caught me slipping it into my satchel.
Shani|Wasn't sure what you needed it for, so I also took a mix of amber, aniseed and juniper. All rather smoky when lit.
Geralt|Thanks. Might come in handy.
Shani|Shall we?
Geralt|Let's go.
Geralt|Love to, I would - but this Olgierd, and Master Mirror, business…
Shani|Enough said. Won't try to talk you into it.
Geralt|Wait, wait - that was your notice?
Shani|What notice?
Geralt|The one posted by the Seven Cats.
Geralt|Need a beau to accompany me to a friend's wedding... If any intelligent, amusing, handsome, none too old nor none too young man owning at least one decent looking frock…
Shani|Hahaha! No, that's not mine.
Shani|So, will you go with me or not?
Geralt|A wedding? Whose?
Shani|A dear friend's - from the academy.
Geralt|Nimble hands you got there.
Shani|I should hope so. I'm a surgeon.
Geralt|Think I prefer you using them this way.
Shani|Less blood?
Geralt|More beauty.
Shani|Hm. There's a beauty to surgery, I assure you.
Geralt|I know. Just… out here, in this landscape, it does more for me than in an operating room.
Shani|Be careful. Please.
Geralt|Oh, I will be. Wouldn't want to give you even more work .
Shani|Change your mind?
Geralt|Nope. Just about to go in.
Shani|The tome was spot on. This is impressive.
Geralt|Yeah. Too bad it's falling apart.
Shani|The family hit on hard times. No coin to splurge on such luxuries.
Shani|Ooh, that looks just a little too creepy for me…
Geralt|Don't have to come if you don't want. Wait here.
Shani|I like that idea.
Shani|If there's any trouble, just yell.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Should look around.
Geralt|Votive fire. Lit in honor of the dead. Old custom.
Geralt|Wraiths. Knew this wouldn't be easy.
Geralt|Hm. Old tombstone. Inscription's almost worn off completely.
Geralt|Eulalia von Everec, died in 1250.
Geralt|Kest… Kestatis? Not who I'm looking for.
Geralt|Honoratina, loving wife of Kestatis, died in 1257.
Geralt|Alexy, age 19, beloved son and brother.
Geralt|Vlodimir von Everec, son of Bohumil and Kristina. There you are.
Geralt|Now for the ritual. Gotta spread the incense throughout the crypt, every room.
Geralt|This is no crypt. It's a full-blown mausoleum.
Geralt|Last of the surprises? Sure hope so.
Geralt|Life and death, fire and blood.
Geralt|Arise from the dust, ye whose blood I have brought.
Geralt|Return and walk midst the living, ye who hath departed.
Geralt|Arise as a friend, for I am no foe.
Geralt|Life and death, fire and blood.
Geralt|Time to light the votive fire.
<|endoftext|>
Everc Uncle|Who you are and why you've come matter little. For you'll not leave this place alive.
Geralt|Are you Vlod's ghost?
Everc Grandma|Who asks after my grandson?
Everc Grandpa|It matters not, Honoratina. What I wonder is how this mortal obtained the family's blood. For von Everecs rise only for von Everec blood.
Everc Cousin|True. Yet to my knowledge, only one of our line yet lives - Olgierd.
Everc Uncle|Then we converse with the man who spilt the blood of your grandson, Kestatis.
Geralt|Mean none of you are Vlodimir? It's Olgierd, his brother, who sent me.
Everc Grandpa|You will meet Vlod soon enough. Yet Olgierd you will never see again.
Everc Grandpa|Kill him, von Everecs!
Everc Grandma|For Olgierd's blood!
Geralt|Fire and blood, life and death.
Geralt|I summon ye whose blood I have brought.
Geralt|Fire and blood, life and death.
Everc Uncle|You have summoned me, stranger. Why?
Geralt|Name's Geralt. Came to wake the ghost of Vlodimir von Everec.
<|endoftext|>
Olgierd Brother|How is the old rogue?! Ehh, what I wouldn't give to ride by his side again…
Geralt|No chance of that happening. Could experience something else, though. Something a corpse should find interesting.
Olgierd Brother|Interesting? Out with it - what do you have in mind?
Geralt|Listen, Olgierd gave me a job. Odd as it may sound, I need to show you the time of your life.
Olgierd Brother|Is that so?! Now that, sir, is a brother! I've been dead for years, yet he still looks after me, after my spirits!
Olgierd Brother|How much time do we have?
Geralt|Think one night should do the trick.
Olgierd Brother|Splendid!
Olgierd Brother|Wait just a moment while I hoist my saber and--
Olgierd Brother|What the blistering devils…?!
Geralt|You're a ghost. Can't grab things.
Olgierd Brother|Argh, I keep forgetting. But how am I to revel and ruck and fuck?! Can't lift a tankard to my lips! Can't wield a saber! Can't squeeze a wench as we dance a jig!
Geralt|Guess you'll have to do without. Let's go.
Olgierd Brother|I will go nowhere.
Olgierd Brother|You're to see I enjoy myself, correct? Well, then think of a way to make it possible.
Geralt|How?
Olgierd Brother|Revive my flesh.
Geralt|No can do. Besides, body's probably decomposed.
Olgierd Brother|Then bloody come up with another way. I'll not go anywhere in this state.
Geralt|Hm. Guess I could bring someone here… and you… you could… hm… borrow their body. Just for the night.
Olgierd Brother|You wish me to possess someone?
Geralt|Uh… yeah.
Olgierd Brother|Hm. Say I agree - whose body would I inhabit?
Geralt|Dunno. One of Olgierd's men, maybe? Or a peasant who'd agree to do it for coin.
Olgierd Brother|Oh, no, no, no. I shan't crawl into the skin of some unwashed bandit or dung-eating swineherd!
Olgierd Brother|I've a better idea.
Geralt|Oh, no. Not gonna happen.
Olgierd Brother|Oh, yes. Yes it is.
Shani|Geralt! Wake up! Open your eyes! Where are the smelling salts…?
Geralt|Death was a small price to pay to lie on a lap so lovely… and so near the wonders concealed a bit higher.
Shani|Have you gone mad?
Geralt|Yes. As soon as I laid eyes on you. Promise to stay and stroke my chin and I shall spend the rest of eternity in a hound's body, trodding along by your well-turned calves.
Shani|Geralt! What's happened to you?!
Geralt|Geralt? I'm Vlodimir.
Shani|What?
Geralt|Blast! Fine, fine, give me a moment.
Geralt|Yeah. Definitely don't like being possessed.
Olgierd Brother|You'd not have fainted had you not resisted so fiercely.
Shani|Geralt. Care to explain what's going on here?
Geralt|It's his fault.
Olgierd Brother|A pleasure to meet you, my sweet.
Shani|Whose?
Geralt|His. You know, Olgierd's brother.
Shani|Geralt, there's no one else here.
Olgierd Brother|Seems your lovely maiden friend can neither see nor hear me. Hm, there's potential in that.
Geralt|Leave Shani out of this.
Olgierd Brother|Ah, is that her name? Lovely! A perfect name for a perfect lass!
Geralt|You're testing my patience.
Shani|As you are mine! Can you please explain what's going on here?!
Olgierd Brother|Ooh, fiery. Temperament matches the drapes.
Geralt|Listen, I'm supposed to show Vlodimir von Everec the time of his life. Turned out he's a ghost.
Geralt|So… willing or not, I gotta lend him my body.
Shani|Wait a minute - are you saying you're possessed?
Geralt|Not at the moment. Just now he's standing next to me, coyly grinning at you..
Geralt|But off and on he'll enter my body. So anything I say or do will actually be him, his mind, his intent.
Shani|Uh… What if I want to talk to you, not him?
Olgierd Brother|Huh. Well, she should approach me and ask me to jump out for a bit.
Geralt|Just come up and ask him to leave for a while.
Shani|I see.
Olgierd Brother|Splendid.
Geralt|Right, then, sugarplum, what say you we leave this dank crypt? There's a charming grove nearby where kisses taste sweeter than anywhere else in the world.
Shani|I take it you're Vlodimir now. Doesn't seem like I'll have trouble telling you apart from Geralt.
Geralt|My sentiments exactly. Between you and me, this witcher fellow is an awful bore…
Shani|Hahaha! Only sometimes.
Geralt|Hah! Seems we're kindred spirits. So, off to the nearest hedgerow?
Shani|I'm afraid I have to turn you down, dear ghost.
Geralt|A shame. In that case, point me to the nearest brothel!
Shani|I've got a better idea.
Shani|You see, I've a friend who's getting married. She invited me to the wedding, but I need an escort.
Shani|I had hoped that when Geralt saw me weaving the garland for the wedding, he'd invite me, but, uh… well, I hoped wrong.
Geralt|Hmhmhm… all is not lost, pudding. I shall escort you! No better dancer in all Redania than Vlodimir von Everec!
Shani|Wonderful. I must stop by my home first and change, so we'll meet at the temple.
Geralt|Oooh, I don't like the sound of that.
Shani|Why not?
Geralt|I'm not fond of temples, see. When alive I'd only set foot in one to loot it, and in death I find I despise them all the more.
Geralt|Could we not meet after the ceremony, go straight to the feast?
Shani|Uh, all right. Seems we've no other option.
Geralt|Splendid! Hahahaha. Then I shall see you at the wedding manor!
Olgierd Brother|I must say, witcher, a man could lose his head for a lass like that.
Olgierd Brother|And that comes from none other than Vlodimir von Everec - famed for his taste in women.
Olgierd Brother|So tell me, honestly now, man to ghost - are you her paramour?
Olgierd Brother|For if so, you have my word I shall keep my distance. But if not, then… hohoho, the haylofts we shall devastate together…
Geralt|Let's say we were more than friends… once upon a time.
Olgierd Brother|Hah! You tried to hide it, but I smelled a tryst! I know a thing or two about men, you see.
Olgierd Brother|A shame, though, I'd have satisfied her well. But no cavalier would rut in another's garden.
Olgierd Brother|So, witcher, time for the wedding?
Geralt|Let's go.
Olgierd Brother|Onward. I'll be right behind you.
Geralt|We're just friends. Always have been.
Olgierd Brother|Never professed your love? No heartfelt admissions, confessions?
Geralt|Never anything between us.
Olgierd Brother|You mean to say you never gripped those gorgeous-- Whohohuh.
Olgierd Brother|Never cherished those beautiful, nay, stunning-- So, soft in the head or the loins?
Geralt|Excuse me?
Olgierd Brother|Ahh, a pederast… Fine, if it's not your flavor, you needn't taste. All the better for me. I'll see she's properly satisfied.
Shani|Just before Geralt entered the crypt to summon you, I invited him to my friend's wedding.
Geralt|Good heavens! That's damned good luck!
Shani|The problem is, he turned me down.
Geralt|The crook-pated churl.
Shani|Uh, don't call him that.
Geralt|What choice do I have when he is a churl? I'd never say no to as fair a face as yours.
Geralt|No better dancer in all Redania than Vlodimir von Everec! My ginger muffin, with me, you shall enjoy an evening to top all others!
Geralt|Don't change the subject, my sweet. If a grove's not to your liking, we can cut straight to the chase and make for the nearest haystack.
Geralt|Need to set a few ground rules.
Olgierd Brother|And I needn't do a thing save have the time of my life. Which is exactly what I aim to do.
Geralt|Sorry about that, Shani. That wasn't me.
Shani|So who was it?
Olgierd Brother|Me.
Geralt|Shut up.
Shani|I didn't say anything.
Geralt|Sorry, wasn't talking to you.
Shani|Who to, then?
Geralt|Well, to him. To Vlodimir.
Geralt|Come on, we're wasting time.
Olgierd Brother|I'm not to waste time? Sir, time is all I've left.
Geralt|You this big a pain in the ass when you were alive, too?
Olgierd Brother|Do not anger me, boy. If I've but one night, I want to revel properly, not watch others enjoy themselves.
Geralt|So what do you propose?
Olgierd Brother|I've an idea.
Geralt|Listen, feels like I should know Olgierd better. Tell me something about him.
Olgierd Brother|Oh, a fantastic chap, a true cavalier. You won't find another like him in all Redania.
Olgierd Brother|The best there is for a drink or a brawl. We were pups when we started riding out on raids. Wet behind the ears.
Olgierd Brother|Borderland villagers shat their trousers at the very sound of the word "Olgierd." I was his second-in-command, leading a band of rogues who'd ride through fire for us.
Geralt|Sound like common bandits. Any difference?
Olgierd Brother|Us?! Bandits?! Watch your words. True, some of our swordsmen were mindless brawlers, but not Olgierd.
Olgierd Brother|Always curious, took an interest in all things. He devoured books, adored paintings… and loved the most beautiful maid in the world.
Geralt|Don't mean to pry, but… just a little curious how you died.
Olgierd Brother|Bah, no need to be shy. Folk love such stories. I'd love this one, too, were it not to end with my death.
Geralt|So, how'd it happen?
Olgierd Brother|On raids, it was our custom to storm the ealdorman's hut, then order the local clods to bring us kegs of spirit…
Olgierd Brother|…And provide willing wenches to squeeze and churn about.
Olgierd Brother|Then, sadly, an ambush. Outmanned five-to-one, we were overwhelmed. They killed me. Crushed my skull like an eggshell between an upturned oak table and the stone floor.
Olgierd Brother|A comely maid. You're quite the fool if you've not ploughed her yet.
Geralt|Keep your paws off her.
Olgierd Brother|I'm to enjoy myself. Can I help it that I best like tumbles in the hay with fleshy lasses?
Olgierd Brother|This whole witcher's life - what's it like?
Geralt|Don't want to know.
Olgierd Brother|If indeed I didn't, I'd not have asked. Go on, tell me.
Geralt|You wouldn't like it.
Olgierd Brother|Those Signs - I'd like to try one.
Geralt|What Signs?
Olgierd Brother|Your witcher Signs. Never done it. Could be interesting.
Geralt|Rather not waste any time.
Olgierd Brother|Till the stroke of midnight what I would rather is what matters.
Olgierd Brother|You meander, why? I was to have a good time, not wander about like a knight-errant.
Geralt|You want to be a witcher, so you need to survey the terrain. Know which way the wind's blowing.
Olgierd Brother|Just don't drag me into any brawls with beasts, mind you. With men - have at it.
Olgierd Brother|My, my. Ornery whoresons, those von Everecs, eh?
Geralt|Who are you?
Olgierd Brother|The rogue you seek - Vlodimir von Everec, brother to Olgierd.
Olgierd Brother|Uh! Forgot I cannot even scratch my stones. Though in point of fact, they've not itched much since I died.
Geralt|Didn't want to fight your family. They started it.
Olgierd Brother|I'm dead, not blind. I preferred to see how you'd handle those snobby pricks. And grandmum, too. Besides, what harm could you do them…? They're dead as it is.
Olgierd Brother|Now tell me how you came into Olgierd's blood. If you hurt him, I fear I shall have to kill you.
Geralt|Got it from a… mutual acquaintance of mine and Olgierd's. I'm here on important business.
Olgierd Brother|I'm a swiving corpse. With no interest in important matters - yours or any other bugger's. The sole thing I miss is feasting, corporal diversions, so to speak, but alas…
Geralt|Mentioned you like to enjoy yourself. Well, just so happens that's why I'm here. Your brother sent me.
Geralt|Your brother sent me.
Geralt|Get a lot of visitors?
Olgierd Brother|At times, not often. For when someone does drop by, the whole band comes out to play.
Geralt|Fun-loving family.
Olgierd Brother|True. We're famed for our love of revelry and rumbles. We von Everecs have brawled and raided for generations. It's tradition.
Olgierd Brother|Naturally, with raids comes loot. So we always had the means to celebrate right lavishly.
Olgierd Brother|Towards the end of my life was when things went sour…
Olgierd Brother|But… no point poking at old wounds. Just days before I died, my brother claimed he'd found a way to dig us out, restore our state.
Olgierd Brother|Why do you paw through my ancestor's bones?!
Olgierd Brother|On your way - leave the dead to rest in peace.
Olgierd Brother|Are you a witcher or a scavenger?! Hands off the family heirlooms!
Geralt|Shut up. I do what I want.
Olgierd Brother|Bloody fine mount. Good stance, powerful rump, stable withers… Well, well.
Geralt|See you know your horses.
Olgierd Brother|I should say so! My two greatest passions in life - mares and maidens, heheheh!
Olgierd Brother|I remember that mill. Whenever Olgierd and I got up to mischief, we'd hide out in there.
Olgierd Brother|Once we snuck off with some moonshine. Old cocksucker Yaromir caught us, heheh. Ah, those were the days.
Olgierd Brother|A small graveyard and a white chapel. I know this place. The ealdorwoman hanged herself from a dried out bough.
Olgierd Brother|Ah, ages past, that was. I was but a lad.
Olgierd Brother|See what they're doing? Marking down caravan routes.
Olgierd Brother|Those scribbles mean many a wagon will not make its destination.
Olgierd Brother|You realize how much fisstech they have here?
Olgierd Brother|You could buy half of Temeria.
Olgierd Brother|Charming spot. Scaled monstrosity's made itself a lovely nest.
Olgierd Brother|So this is what's become of the Flaming Rose's fallen petals. Heheh.
Olgierd Brother|They're churning out clouds of fisstech. Air's thick with it.
Olgierd Brother|Go on! Give them hell! Massacre the fuckers, Geralt!
Olgierd Brother|Careful, or the buggers will eat you. And that would ruin my fun.
Olgierd Brother|My, my - bloody impressive treasures.
Olgierd Brother|My nose tells me they hid some treasure here. I've a very trusty sniffer.
Olgierd Brother|There's something there, Geralt. Beyond that wall.
Olgierd Brother|Damned fine show, witcher. A feast for the eyes.
Olgierd Brother|Now that's fun! Just like the old times. When I was alive.
Olgierd Brother|Very well, sir witcher. Show me what you've got.
Olgierd Brother|Fat fucking beast.
Olgierd Brother|I'm in the mood for fun. You've no notion how long it's been since I fondled a perky pair. Let's go to this wedding.
Olgierd Brother|This wedding - we will go there soon, yes?
Geralt|Grave robber. Tried to crawl in through the well, broke his neck.
Olgierd Brother|Meaning the scabby runt wished to rob our family crypt.
Olgierd Brother|I detest spiders. The creepers make my sphincter shut tight.
Geralt|Spooking my horse. Roach doesn't like ghosts.
Geralt|Hmm. Probably shouldn't touch that.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|May they draw and quarter me if I've ever seen a lovelier lass!
Shani|Nothing left of you to draw and quarter, alas.
Geralt|Doe eyes! A swan's soft, supple neck! And a waist so slim you could grip it one-handed!
Shani|You're actually quite amusing this way.
Geralt|Be assured - you'll like me even better when you come to know me more intimately.
Shani|How intimately?
Geralt|Enough to get a sense of my assets, my dear. Trust me, they're nothing to scoff at.
Shani|May I please speak to Geralt for a moment?
Geralt|Whatever for? This evening is about my pleasure, not his.
Shani|Just for a moment? Then you can jump right back in.
Olgierd Brother|Be quick. I'll not stand here doing naught. I'm to enjoy myself.
Shani|Geralt, I'm about to introduce you to the newlyweds. Please make sure your friend doesn't embarrass me.
Geralt|I can't make him do anything. All that nonsense is his. Feel like an ass saying it.
Shani|I liked some of that nonsense.
Geralt|We'll talk later. Let's go to this wedding. The sooner the ghost has his fun, the sooner this'll be over.
Olgierd Brother|Finally, something that's not utter tripe. We shall dance till the break of dawn!
Geralt|You get till midnight, and not a second longer.
Olgierd Brother|That's not enough. I shan't even get properly soused by midnight, let alone--
Geralt|Make an effort. I'm sure you'll manage. You get to frolic and carouse till midnight - that's our deal. Then there's the capping. Then you go back where you came from.
Olgierd Brother|So be it.
Geralt|This way, my strawberry.
Geralt|Aaaaah. Hello, world - I'm back.
Geralt|I'll be damned - a proper wedding. Overladen tables, plenty of worthy drinking companions… and a swarm of fair maids…
Geralt|But none compare to you, my dear rhubarb.
Geralt|Beware of the dog, Shani. Judging by the size of its house, the mutt must be big as a horse.
Shani|Thanks for your concern, but the doghouse is empty.
Geralt|They let a man-eater like that run free? Have the wedding guests been warned? Seems we are indeed in for a cracking good time.
Shani|Oh, what a lovely rowan! I remember making necklaces of the fruit when I was a child.
Geralt|Ah, the berries make for splendid hooch! Olgierd and I'd brew it in our teething years.
Shani|I shall introduce you to the newlyweds now. Try to behave.
Geralt|For you, my rowan petal, I'd do anything.
Geralt|What, for example?
Shani|It would do you good to be more relaxed sometimes.
Geralt|Relaxed? So you think I'm uptight?
Shani|What I mean is it would be nice from time to time if you could sit back and enjoy life, instead of going around solving everyone's problems.
Geralt|But what does-- Ugh, I don't understand.
Olgierd Brother|Of course you don't. You're as dense as year-old hardtack. Luckily, you've got me.
Geralt|You see? Geralt's been a pill, a nag. That all changes today.
Shani|Dramatically, I'd say. He's never been very talkative, to start with.
Geralt|He's been a fool. But I shall make up for that now - will you marry me?
Shani|Hah. A big step, but I will think about it. For now, we should simply enjoy my friend's wedding.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Once more, all the best in your new life.
Groom|Thank you.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|It's us, now. Dearies, blessings rain down upon you.
Novigrad Peasant 03|May you live in 'ealth and 'appiness. Harmony and love forever last betwixt you.
Bride|Thank you, from the bottom of our 'earts.
Groom|Now go, enjoy the feast.
Shani|Our turn.
Shani|My dear friend Aldona, and her chosen one, Johnnus.
Geralt|It's an honor. The sun shine brightly on this new path in your lives. I am Vlo--
Shani|This is my friend of yesteryear - Geralt of Rivia.
Geralt|Yes, 'tis I, Geralt. A witcher. Heartfelt thanks for your hospitality. I adore weddings. The brides, especially - so fragrant, so tasty, I could--
Shani|Righto. I'm sure we'll all have a splendid time.
Geralt|We've chewed the fat enough. Time's a-wastin'!
Groom|Are you… expected elsewhere?
Geralt|Me? Hah! I simply cannot wait to sample your liquors and dance with the local matrons.
Bride|Johnnus and I invited more than a few lovely maidens. Perhaps one of them will catch your eye.
Geralt|Ohh, that's for damn certain!
Groom|And perhaps you will catch one of their--
Geralt|It'd be nice, certainly, but I shan't be terribly bothered if it's not the case. Come, let's drink!
Geralt|Aren't you an extraordinary beauty, my dear.
Bride|Why, thank you.
Geralt|You had your pick of gents, I'm sure.
Groom|Where is this goin'?
Geralt|I'm attempting to discern why she choose you, Johnnus.
Groom|Mean you don't approve of my wife's choice?
Geralt|I've no skin in this game. I ask out of pure curiosity.
Groom|Well, rein it in. Or I shall have to explain my wife's choice to you hands on. Out of pure pleasure.
Geralt|Why so testy, friend? Have I insulted you? Merely told your wife she was a beautiful woman. Yet here I'm threatened instead of getting thanks. Have some manners.
Shani|Geralt, that's enough. She simply fell in love. That's that. Johnnus, I'm sure my friend meant no offense.
Geralt|Aldona seems a curious choice for a bride. Did she come with a hefty dowry?
Groom|I assure you, witcher, my choice had naught to do with coin.
Bride|Johnnus' family is far better off than mine. They've a textile manufactory.
Groom|It took a lot of convincing to get mother to agree to our, as some would have it, mésalliance.
Bride|T-ah. You never told me. Whatever happened to "Fortune is of no import to me and my family?"
Shani|It isn't. Johnnus told me the same - that your background doesn't bother him.
Geralt|Never does, not at love's first blossoming. But give it time, five years, and you'll find few things that don't bother you.
Groom|I'm beginnin' to find what you say bothersome. I don't know where you're from, but in these parts it is rude to insult newlyweds at a weddin'.
Geralt|Insult? I'm merely warning you. Know a thing or two about life, you see.
Shani|Hm. Geralt and his jests. He has a strange sense of humor.
Groom|Very strange, I'd say.
Geralt|Tell me, Aldona, how is it you and my dear Shani know each other?
Bride|We met in Oxenfurt. Both studied medicine at the Academy.
Shani|Wondrous times.
Bride|Over quickly, in my case, alas. My family couldn't afford to keep me there. I was forced to return home after one year.
Geralt|It's never too late to pursue an education, my dear. Your husband is certain to help you complete your studies, provide the necessary coin.
Bride|I don't know. We've not talked about it.
Geralt|Come, Johnnus, surely you've not taken Aldona as a mere diversion for the alcove? You will help her, will you not?
Groom|That is between me and her. You needn't butt in.
Geralt|But I'm not. I merely ask! See, I've come to love your wife like a sister. So I ask you as your brother-in-law: will you help her?
Groom|I'm sure we'll discuss the matter.
Geralt|Hahahaha. That's my lad! You're a right decent chap, I knew it from the start!
Groom|Wish you a rolling good time at our little celebration, witcher.
Groom|I'm honored you graced our weddin' with your presence.
Bride|Witcher, try me mum's apple tart. It's divine. But stay away from the gingerbread. Didn't turn out, sadly.
Bride|Seen how you look at Shani. Treat her right, or you'll have me to reckon with.
Shani|You must have a splendid time - that's what matters. Make the most of it!
Shani|The capping starts at midnight. Until then - enjoy yourself, go wild.
Shani|What a wonderful wedding. It's clear the newlyweds' parents spared no expense.
Olgierd Brother|Behold. Wars've started over uglier wenches. Well, raids've been undertaken, at least.
Geralt|True, she looks lovely. Let's go.
Olgierd Brother|Whoa, whoa, hold! Mean to go in… wearing that?
Geralt|What else?
Olgierd Brother|Have you seen how she's dressed? I'll not parade at that jewel's side in a rank tunic.
Olgierd Brother|You need a robe! One daren't attend a wedding in anything less!
Geralt|Don't happen to have a robe handy.
Olgierd Brother|What do you mean? What about that?
Geralt|Oh, no. We're not gonna steal.
Olgierd Brother|Come, now. We're merely borrowing.
Geralt|Ah, this'll do wonderfully.
Geralt|Perfect fit. It feels tailor-made.
Geralt|Now for shoes. One must wear shoes to a wedding.
Geralt|Hm. And we must be neat…
Geralt|All in all… why not.
Olgierd Brother|Ah! That's the spirit!
Shani|Come, time to meet and be greeted.
Geralt|I shan't stray a step from your side.
Shani|Time to say hello. Be nice, now.
Bride|Delighted you made the long journey to be here with us.
Novigrad Peasant 01|Course we did. How could we not be here for our only niece?
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|We'd 'ave trekked from Kovir if we'd had to. This is your special day, love.
Geralt|Can't get drunk that way. Come on - in you go. And remember - enjoy yourself.
Olgierd Brother|Needn't remind me of that.
Geralt|No sign of her yet. We need to wait.
Olgierd Brother|This is very romantic.
Geralt|Fuck off.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Look, look, look, look! Munchkins playing cards!
Shani|In the mood to lighten Geralt's purse?
Geralt|Geralt won't mind. He's wild about cards!
Halfling Man 03|Those ass ears suit you, friend. Hahaha!
Halfling Man 04|Who's stupid idea was it to make the loser wear these damned ears?
Halfling Man 02|Yours! Don't you remember?!
Halfling Man 04|Save your laughter. Mark my words, I'll soon win. Then we'll see who the ass ears suit best.
Halfling Man 02|Perhaps you'd care to sit down to some gwent with us?
Geralt|Most certainly would! You needn't ask twice, midget.
Halfling Man 03|No need for insults.
Geralt|It's no insult, it's the truth. He's a midget.
Halfling Man 04|Like I said, that's an insult.
Geralt|Would you call your chum a giant?
Halfling Man 02|Shut up. You playin' or not?
Geralt|Let us play, gentlefolk.
Halfling Man 03|What's your wager?
Geralt|Everything. The whole lot. I'm all in.
Shani|Mh. I never knew you to be such a gambler.
Geralt|You shall see many new sides of me this night, my dear.
Geralt|Many large sides.
Halfling Man 04|Normally we play that the loser's got to wear the ass ears.
Geralt|I needn't care. I shan't lose.
Geralt|I'm sorry. I meant no offense.
Halfling Man 04|Were that true, you wouldn't 'ave called him a midget.
Geralt|I've apologized. What else would you have me do? Bring him flowers?
Halfling Man 02|I'd have you play, and stop talkin'.
Geralt|You're tits up, mate. Slap those ass' ears on your ass' noggin!
Shani|Such a shame. I'd already pictured you in those ears. Quite the interesting picture, too.
Geralt|I know of other ways to look interesting. I could show you…
Shani|I'll think about it.
Halfling Man 03|Time to drink. We are at a wedding!
Geralt|Aye, let's drink, my time's as short as you are, friends!
Halfling Man 04|To the witcher and his betrothed!
Geralt|Hear that, Shani? My betrothed. Know what that means?
Shani|No. What?
Geralt|It means we should act as befits the betrothed.
Shani|And what's that mean?
Geralt|I woo you, you resist, but it all ends as everyone knows it must.
Geralt|Ahh, the merriment! Good show indeed! Let's continue the ball!
Shani|It'll be midnight soon. The capping will begin. In the barn.
Geralt|I must have some sort of last hurrah.
Shani|Oh, but the capping! All the guests need to be present.
Halfling Man 02|You lose, witcher! Hand over the wager. Everything!
Geralt|Ehrm, perhaps we could reach an arrangement…?
Halfling Man 03|No weaselin' out of this! Hand over the coin!
Olgierd Brother|What do we do now?
Geralt|Feel good? Losing somebody else's coin?
Olgierd Brother|I meant to win, give you the coin. I've no need for it in the grave.
Geralt|But you lost, so now I've gotta pay up.
Halfling Man 04|I say, he talking to himself? Roaring drunk already, that's it.
Halfling Man 03|We can't fleece a drunk. Have him don the cap, and we'll call it even.
Halfling Man 02|Just a minute. Bloke needs a lesson. I say he dons the cap and gives us five percent of the coin he has.
Geralt|Hear that?
Geralt|Agreed. Five percent is yours. And I shall wear the cap, never fear. A man must do what a man must do, and Vlodimir von Everec's a man among men!
Halfling Man 03|Hear that? So sloshed he thinks he's Vlodimir von Everec.
Halfling Man 04|Rogue's long dead, by my reckoning.
Halfling Man 02|Exactly.
Shani|Haha - those ears! You look, uh… interesting.
Halfling Man 02|Stay away. I must focus on the game.
Halfling Man 03|Witcher! My heartiest wishes for joy on your new life's path. You've chosen quite the fetchin' wench.
Halfling Man 04|Blasted gwent. Can't stand it. Soon as I start playing, I just can't stop.
Halfling Man 02|That witcher's an odd duck.
Halfling Man 04|As freaks tend to be.
Halfling Man 02|But so odd as to talk to themselves?
Halfling Man 03|True, that's a bit out o' sorts. But to his credit, he's a beautiful lass at his side.
Halfling Man 04|Ah, yes. Quite the feather in his cap. Had he a cap.
Shani|I think you look charming.
Geralt|Quite the lark, this gwent.
Geralt|Onward, to the next diversion!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What do you mean, hands to myself? That'd be no fun at all. Besides, I thought you too would enjoy it.
Shani|Oh, I like to kiss… and get kissed. But mostly with one person at a time - and there's two of you in there.
Geralt|Aye, yet only one did what set your heart aflame. Me.
Shani|Aaaaa…
Shani|Could I talk to Geralt for a moment?
Geralt|What for? He'll have nothing of interest to say. The man's a drip.
Shani|Please?
Geralt|Very well.
Olgierd Brother|See how I've reeled her in? Now don't fuck this up.
Shani|Geralt, I'm curious what it's like when that ghost's inside you. Do you feel anything? Have any control?
Geralt|I feel everything. Don't have any control over what I do or say, though. Why do you ask?
Shani|Because I wonder what it would've been like to dance with you. Just you.
Geralt|Can't say what would've happened. Probably wouldn't have danced at all.
Shani|Oh, really?
Olgierd Brother|Shut up, shut up! You'll ruin everything!
Geralt|At any rate, I wash my hands of all my actions till the stroke of midnight.
Shani|I see.
Geralt|Happen to see the man who announced our-- your song?
Shani|Yes, he acted as though he knew me, but we've never met. I was surprised. Who is he?
Geralt|Gaunter O'Dimm. Master Mirror. Wonder what he's doing here…?
Olgierd Brother|Then perhaps you should just ask him.
Geralt|Yeah. He didn't show up without a reason. Need to talk to him.
Olgierd Brother|Considered that he might have simply been nearby and dropped in on a whim?
Geralt|Promise you this much - he never does anything simply. And certainly not on a whim.
Olgierd Brother|Beh, I was to make merry, carouse, yet here I've stood the last five minutes listening to you talk. I'm going back in.
Geralt|Ah, better! Come, Shani. The night beckons us not to jabber it away.
Geralt|Well, I probably wouldn't 'ave forced myself on you.
Olgierd Brother|Forced myself?! It was an innocent kiss, naught more!
Shani|I don't know if I should thank you or if that should make me… angry.
Geralt|Don't get me wrong - I've thought about doing just that a few times, but…
Shani|But what?
Geralt|But I'm not going to talk about it with him here. We can discuss it once he's gone.
Shani|I'll hold you to that.
Olgierd Brother|Whoa! Hold there, mate! You said you weren't interested back in the crypt. Now, suddenly, after I've beat the cream all night, you swoop in to dip your berry? And aim to delight in it without me present?
Geralt|Shut up.
Shani|What's going on now?
Geralt|Nothing. Never mind.
Olgierd Brother|Perhaps a bit of thanks is in order? Seems I've snared the little robin for you.
Geralt|You can shut up now.
Geralt|Probably I'd a done what he did. Still like to…
Olgierd Brother|Then why don't you? Well? Answer me!
Geralt|Thing is, normal folk don't act like Vlodimir von Everec.
Olgierd Brother|Because they are churls.
Shani|Don't be too hard on him. All in all, he's actually rather fun.
Olgierd Brother|Hah! See that? I'm fun! And you've got a pike so far up your arse, you can't wear hats!
Geralt|Don't be upset, my peach. I couldn't resist.
Shani|I'm not upset. Just, next time don't lunge at me like that.
Geralt|I'd had a long fast, so to speak. Hunger overwhelmed me. But yes, next time I shall ask.
Geralt|Shani, may I kiss you?
Shani|Hahahaha! You're incorrigible.
Geralt|Yes, yes… but admit it - it was fantastic, eh?
Shani|Is there anything you do that's not fantastic?
Geralt|The ladies loved my kisses. Not to mention the other tricks I perform with my lips.
Shani|Yes, we'd best not mention those.
Geralt|Ah, my kind of tune! Let's do some dancing!
Shani|In my experience, witchers and dancing don't exactly mix.
Geralt|Today they mix like fire and oil, my love! We'll dance the barn down!
Geralt|Faster! Faster! Till we expire!
Mirror|And now, a special treat for our special guests - the witcher Geralt and his enchanting partner, Shani. Musicians, something lovely for the loving couple…
Geralt|At last, music for a loving embrace!
Geralt|Come, Shani. It's time you discovered my romantic side.
Shani|Huh. You're rather good at this.
Geralt|They say dance is a mere foretaste of… hmm… more intimate interaction.
Shani|Who says this?
Geralt|I do, for one.
Shani|I do wonder what you mean by "intimate interaction."
Geralt|Ohhh, it's a fascinating process. One you, as a scholar and medic, might find especially interesting.
Geralt|I'd gladly explain it in detail, but it's horribly loud in here…
Geralt|Hmm… see the ladder? Leads to a loft. Surely there we'd not be disturbed while investigating the nature of intimate interaction.
Geralt|Seems the music and the evening draw to a close. Know how a true dancer thanks his lovely partner?
Shani|I'm… not sure I do.
Shani|What're you doing? Have you lost your mind?
Geralt|I have! My mind, my heart - for you.
Shani|We must agree - you can say whatever you please, but you shall keep your hands to yourself. Understood?
Geralt|A chair could dance a jig with you as its partner!
Shani|Oh, how humble you are.
Geralt|I strive to be. Yet should the need arise, I can strut as proud as any peacock.
Shani|Oh, the perfect combination. Women must love you.
Geralt|Well, not to brag, but…
Shani|Call it idle curiosity, but… how many have you had?
Geralt|Many. And not a scrub hag among them, I should add. Women with true class, all - though none to match your charms.
Geralt|Not a man here who could out-dance me. It's a gift, my legs are preternaturally skilled.
Shani|I never expected the members of Olgierd's band to have a taste for dancing.
Geralt|Yet it's so! We'd dance and dance - at every opportunity. As fond of fun as fighting - our motto!
Geralt|The night is young. Come, let's do something wild!
Geralt|Look there, Shani. The ladder begs us to scamper to its top, where we can… converse.
Shani|Then let us scamper.
Geralt|But… how so? Just like that?
Shani|There aren't that many ways to scale a ladder.
Shani|Let's sit. Come now.
Geralt|Just… like that?
Shani|I'm all ears. What would have us talk about? I'm sorry - converse about.
Geralt|Well… when it comes right down to it…
Shani|Yes…?
Geralt|You see… the thing is…
Shani|Come now, spit it out.
Geralt|Akhem. I…
Shani|Yes, just as I thought. Come, it's time we returned.
Geralt|But… what's just as you thought? I find you intimidating!
Shani|Loudly lowing cows only ever give a little milk.
Geralt|I've only ever dealt with simple maids. Whereas you're a surgeon!
Geralt|I believe I was right not to just take you and, well-- I was right to take the more romantic approach.
Shani|Oh, all right. Now come. We were to enjoy ourselves. Let's do just that. Romantically…
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Seen what he pulled from the water? An old pot!
Novigrad Peasant 02|Mayhaps his lass wears pots for shoes - case she can't find a privy!
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|You were s'posed to fish out me slipper. How'm I to dance now, with one foot bared? 'Tis a wedding, I've got to wear slippers!
Novigrad Peasant 03|I looked, dearie, I did. 'Tain't there. Muck must've sucked it deep in.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|Well poke your paws in there! Rut for it! Rubbish game.
Geralt|What's all this, then?
Shani|They're playing "Slip In for a Slipper." Never heard of it?
Geralt|Never. Us gentryfolk have other diversions. What's the object?
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Maid tosses her shoe in the water, her man's got to dive in an' fish it out.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Oh my…
Geralt|Oh, there's more to come…
Geralt|Prime game! Shani, your slipper! I shall prove I'd dive to any depth for you!
Geralt|And once I retrieve it?
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Well, your maid'll be pleased as punch, for it means you're a gallant beau and awful handy…
Geralt|Is that all? No prize? Not even a kiss?
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|That depends on the miss in question. If she wants to give you a kiss, she will. But she ain't obliged.
Novigrad Peasant 02|Look, mutations don't just turn them barren as a mule, they give 'em an ass's ears to boot! Hah. Must have some other horse part hidden in his trousers.
Geralt|Damn mucky, that pond. Sank in up to my armpits.
Shani|Mucky as it might be, the lake still couldn't keep my shoe from you.
Geralt|See, my blueberry? Such devotion in a small matter. Now imagine my devotion in matters large.
Shani|Hmm, something specific in mind?
Geralt|Why, naturally! Ride off with me, Shani! To Kovir, Poviss, Zerrikania, even! With a maid like you at my side, I could conquer the world!
Shani|Haha. Lovely plans, but I fear they're impossible to realize in just one evening.
Geralt|Too true. But it's nice to dream.
Geralt|Ah well. Recognize this, Cinderella?
Shani|My shoe?
Geralt|Mhm… now extend your supple leg and let me slide it in-- that is, on…
Shani|Uh, thank you.
Shani|It'll be midnight soon. The capping will begin.
Geralt|What? How? Already? Damn, time soars…
Shani|We need to go to the barn. All the guests must attend the capping. Including you.
Geralt|I know, I know. I shall be there soon.
Shani|Huh. I see no amount of silt could keep you from my shoe. And all the other shoes ever tossed in the lake.
Geralt|Always better to do a bit more and even gain naught by it, than to do too little and face regret.
Shani|Hm, that's quite the theory.
Geralt|One founded in practice. For instance, I can now approach the owner of any of these slippers and she will lift up her skirt and bend over… to don it, of course.
Shani|Ah, so generous - and clever!
Geralt|Just figuring that out? Hm, I believe I've earned a kiss.
Shani|Well, find the owners of those shoes. One might agree.
Geralt|Don't be jealous, Shani, that was but a jest. I don't give a piffle about the others.
Shani|Never expected silt could conquer a man like you.
Geralt|Alas, I couldn't raise it up - for the first time in my life, I swear, Shani.
Shani|Devastating for you, I'm sure - but I'm left without a shoe.
Geralt|Never fear. I shall retrieve it - or drown trying.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|Jozzy! What's takin' you so long?
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|Bring me my shoe! Quick, now! It's gettin' shameful!
Novigrad Peasant 01|Fine lad you got there, haven't you, Yagna?! Can't even pull a li'l slipper out of a pond…
Novigrad Peasant 01|An' here I swim like a greased minnow - best in the village. Told you.
Geralt|Look, a lake! I can't remember the last time I had a dip…
Geralt|What're they up to…?
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|See how quick he come up with her shoe, loves? Ehh… lad like that'd be a treasure 'round the farm.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Really? Dunno, meself. Losin' shoes in lakes has never been much of a problem at my place.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|Thick, y'are. 'Tain't about fishin' up shoes - it's about what else he might do a proper job of.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|He looked hearty enough, but couldn't even pull up a measly slipper.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|That's how it goes - the louder a cow moos, the drier its udders.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|Still, he's right 'andsome.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|What of it? He'll fatten, then wrinkle like a prune without. Stay the same good-for-nothin' inside.
Geralt|Nothing like a good swim.
Geralt|Now we must do something else. Something wild.
Shani|Did you find my shoe?!
Shani|If not, I think you should come back and look for it! In the lake!
Geralt|Stay calm, my crimson dove. Vlod will see to everything.
Geralt|Just when you think you know all the ploughfolk's customs, they surprise you with slippers.
Shani|So now the shock's faded, perhaps you could stop talking and fish out my shoe, which I so unfortunately lost in the pond?
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|Seems to think the slippin'll be easy, don't he?
Novigrad Peasant 02|He talks a big talk, let's see how big his stroke is.
Novigrad Peasant 01|That one's a witcher.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Beh, so what? Witchers famed for shoe-fishin' skills, or somethin'?
Novigrad Peasant 03|Sure as rain, he'll come up empty-handed.
Novigrad Peasant 02|What's this one playin' at? Slip In for a Slipper, or stand-there-'n-do-nothing?
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Tossed the shoe in all gallant-like. Seems lots less eager to dive in after it.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|Guess his maid's gonna dance the rest o' the weddin' barefoot.
Novigrad Peasant 01|Or just hop 'round on one.
Geralt|Observe, Shani.
Shani|My eyes are glued.
<|endoftext|>
Shani|Do you need help?
Bride Mother|Shani, darling… Oh, you shan't believe what's happened. I'm marrying off my only daughter. Wanted a proper wedding for her, wild revelry. So I hired a true fire eater - you know, whoosh, gulp, sizzle, sizzle.
Geralt|Oooh, I've not seen that sort of trickery.
Bride Father|Horribly dear, diversions of that sort. He'd journeyed here from Novigrad.
Bride Mother|But I'll not squeeze coppers on my daughter, oh no. The groom's family have us for paupers, but we'll show them how wrong they are.
Bride Father|Seems we won't, in fact, for our fire swallower's as gone as last Yule's puddin'.
Bride Mother|Groom's hound chased him off! That blasted Daemon. Hrmph, they sure named it right!
Bride Father|Calm yourself, dumplin'. Master witcher's here now, perhaps he can aid us.
Geralt|You needn't worry. The witcher - that is, I - will find this swallower of heated things.
Bride Mother|Oh, mighty generous offer, but no one knows where to look.
Geralt|Matters not. Witchers-- that is, we have our ways. The flame gulper, what did he look like?
Bride Father|He wore a jester's cap, typical sort. Ought to be enough to identify him.
Geralt|I shall find him.
Bride Mother|We thank you. And hope for the best.
Shani|Agh, awfully nice of you to offer your help, but are you sure you're up to it? You're not actually a witcher, Vlodimir.
Olgierd Brother|I wish to find this magician. Give it a go, all right? But you cannot help me. I must do it alone - I expect it will be great fun.
Geralt|Ugh. Fine. Don't have to do this, but if I were you, I'd find the dog's tracks, follow its trail. Just a thought.
Olgierd Brother|Excellent advice. I'll take it!
Geralt|Shani, Vlodimir and I need to find the fire eater. If we're not back by midnight, then…
Shani|Relax. You'll be back in no time. I believe in you.
Geralt|Tally-ho! Adventure awaits!
Geralt|Before I can begin my witcherly investigation, I require guidance, clues. Tell me all you know. Everything.
Bride Mother|Well, the fire eater arrived around noon. Ate his fill, of food not fire, then went for a stroll, to air some gasses, he said. That horror Daemon saw him and started barking like a thing possessed.
Geralt|Why so?
Bride Mother|Haven't a clue. Didn't like the man, sensed something awry. Perhaps that the man swallowed fire - animals fear fire.
Geralt|If afeared, it would have fled, not given chase.
Bride Mother|Damn fool dog - how can you know? But it snapped its chain and chased the fire eater into the woods.
Bride Father|Foolish or not, it's our son-in-law's beloved pet. There'll be hell to pay if it goes missin'.
Bride Mother|How? The man's got ass ears. He should first seek to help himself.
Bride Father|Such ears might be high fashion in his parts…
Bride Mother|Oh, I doubt that…
Bride Mother|He arrived, that's certain - I saw him myself.
Bride Father|So if he arrived, why's he not here now?
Bride Mother|The bloody dog chased him away!
Bride Father|Daemon?
Bride Mother|None other! Hideous mutt.
Bride Father|Oh, bother… means we're missin' a fire eater and a dog…
Geralt|A missing hound, it seems. Perhaps we can be of service. My first witcherly investigation - I've goose pimples!
Bride Mother|I won't even think on the coin we lost on that fire eater.
Bride Mother|She's my only daughter, shan't begrudge her any expense.
Bride Mother|Oh, it would've been perfect! Damned mutt!
Bride Father|That woman'll lament my head off if no one finds that juggler.
Bride Mother|So much coin, all for naught. I do hope the mutant can find the fire eater.
Bride Father|And I hope he finds Daemon. A quarrel with the in-laws? Wouldn't want that.
Bride Mother|The fire eater will prove us a decent family. A family that throws a proper wedding - can afford it!
Bride Father|Stop your grievin'. Mutant like that's made to hunt beasts, track down the missin'. He'll dig him up.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|The hound tore its chain off the wall. Underfed, it seems.
Geralt|Or else the ash licker really boiled the mutt's blood.
Geralt|A bone gnawed so clean I've only ever seen two like this. One in an anthill.
Geralt|The other when I caught a hen after not eating for a week.
Geralt|Its bowl is chipped?
Geralt|Tried to devour its bowl along with its supper? Daft mutt.
Geralt|A dog made these tracks, true, but a small one. Yet judging by its house, Daemon is a hulk.
Geralt|But beggars can't choose their tracks… so I shall follow these.
Geralt|More dog tracks. This witcher business is a jest.
Geralt|I'm clearly on the right trail. Unless, I'm not…
Geralt|A spark spitter's cap, if I've ever seen one. As jesterly as they come.
Geralt|Chap must've lost it running from Daemon.
Geralt|Two conclusions, then - our magician is fat, and a coward.
Shani|Following some dog's trail? Not exactly how I imagined this wedding. Think I'll wait here.
Geralt|Wonderful, my juicy pear. I shall continue my travails while you rest. Shan't be long now.
Geralt|A broken branch. As if one too heavy sought to scamper up this tree.
Geralt|Seems our fire eater swallows a great deal more than fire.
Geralt|Or perhaps someone was merely gathering kindling? Ah, there is joy in this ferreting!
Geralt|I've found the hearth huffer. Damned fine work, eh?
Shani|Yes. Where is he?
Geralt|Buggered off. Doubt we'll see any more of him.
Shani|How goes the search?
Geralt|No discoveries of note as yet.
Geralt|But I shan't give up. This witcher work suits me swimmingly.
Geralt|I found a stick by a tree.
Shani|A stick in the woods? Quite the discovery.
Geralt|Don't laugh. I've cracked the case - chased by the mutt, the flame sniffer scampered up the tree, his heft snapping a branch.
Geralt|He survived the incident, no blood to be found… though no fire snorter, either.
Shani|So you haven't actually found him.
Geralt|Not as such... but I'm close, I can smell it.
Geralt|I found the hearth huffer.
Shani|Really? Where is he?
Geralt|Hm… misfortune befell him. Sad, really. Shan't be seeing him again.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Save me! Sod off, beast! Somebody drag this drool bucket away!
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Is there anyone in this forsaken hole?! Anyone at all??
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Help! Somebody 'elp me! Save me! Anybody!
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|I require a rescue! Get me outta here! Before it tears me to shreds!
Geralt|Missing man, missing mutt.
Olgierd Brother|Am I seeing this right? That gammy puss ran up a tree to escape that puppy?
Geralt|Guess so. You! Get down!
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Oh, no. No bloody chance! I value my life!
Olgierd Brother|What do we do?
Geralt|Sit.
Olgierd Brother|Now that is power! If I'd had that, the whoresons never would've gutted me.
Olgierd Brother|Make it do some folly. Roll about on the ground, that sort of sport!
Geralt|No.
Olgierd Brother|Ugh, could you be any more of a bore? I'll do it myself.
Geralt|Roll over!
Geralt|Leave it alone.
Olgierd Brother|Were I to command it to eat its own tail, it would do so, right?
Geralt|Daemon! Doghouse, now!
Olgierd Brother|Now what've you done? Why ever? Ruined my fun.
Geralt|Have it at the wedding.
Geralt|Climb down. Man-eating beast's gone, as you can see.
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|You sure it won't return?
Geralt|Positive.
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Better safe than sorry, I always say…
Olgierd Brother|Geralt, this jester is drunk as a skunk. I hope he's not polished off that bottle yet.
Geralt|I saved your life, man. Do you not at least owe me a sip?
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Course. Bottoms up.
Geralt|I say, cracking good mead. Now I understand why you wanted some private time with it.
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Fine mead, true… But I was fleeing an 'ound? 'Ound? Bah, it was a monster, a furry, fangy devil! They chose a fittin' name for it…
Geralt|You can forget about performing in your state.
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|And just what state would that be?
Geralt|Look at yourself, man. You're a tramp, can barely stand, let alone perform.
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|First off - that's bollocks. Second, I'm a fire eater, not a stilt walker. Standin' straight ain't a requirement…
Geralt|Oh, you shan't pull the wool over my eyes. I know your type.
Geralt|Now, here's the plan - we shall head down this path till we arrive at the wedding. You'll have sobered by then.
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|But--
Geralt|Silence! Do you know me, sir? When a nobleman speaks, you listen!
Geralt|You will stay close at my side. We will return to the wedding, where you will put on a show to make our honored guests soil their breeches from joy. Got it?
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Y-yes.
Geralt|Good. Then let's be off.
Geralt|This may be my only chance to ask - your fire guzzling trickery, how does it work?
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Ooh, they'd toss me out the guild if I told. 'Cept if I took you on as an apprentice. In 'alf a year's time, you'd learn.
Geralt|I haven't half a year. Come, just between you and me. We've drunk together - we're practically brothers!
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Drank it all yourself. You're no brother of mine.
Geralt|You dare toy with me this way?! Very well! Refuse to tell me, and I shall leave you here as a morsel for any passing boars, bears or bloodthirsty fawns. So choose wisely.
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|This here's assault! He's suppressin' the arts!
Geralt|Out with it!
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|I g-- I got this special mixture I drink before every show. After that, I can eat fire, spit fire, do what I please, and it don't burn nothing.
Geralt|Is that all? Where's the art in it? Any dribbling imbecile can smear his throat with a protective slurry.
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|I've had just about enough of this! First they release the hounds, then come and steal my mead, and now insults! I'm done 'ere! Goodbye!
Olgierd Brother|Didn't mean to offend the bloody charlatan. Do something.
Geralt|Listen, I'll give you some more coin, and you'll go back to the wedding.
Olgierd Brother|Are you daft?! This extortionist's already got his due!
Geralt|Take it or leave it.
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Right. Convincin'.
Olgierd Brother|Honorless prick. Olgierd had it right - all artists are whores.
Geralt|Let's go.
Geralt|Now, you're gonna forget everything you've seen, said and heard in the woods.
Olgierd Brother|Wouldn't a smack upside the head help the matter? Put the cheating coward back in his place?
Geralt|No need.
Geralt|You'll go back to the wedding and show everybody your tricks.
Olgierd Brother|Ugh, your charlatan's tricks.
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Yes, sir. I'll do as you say.
Geralt|Do what you want. Not about to beg you to stay.
Olgierd Brother|But the scamp's already been paid!
Geralt|Not my problem.
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Uh-huh. Then know this - I leave now. I've never seen such behavior. This is overt lack of respect for the arts.
Olgierd Brother|You two-bit honorless pricklicker!
Geralt|No sense raging about it. Back to the wedding, let's go.
Geralt|Your cap, sir. Lost it running from that pup like a gutless coward.
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Ohh… my dearest cap. Always brought me good luck, it has… I wear it for every performance.
Geralt|You're a man who's trade is literally to play with fire. How can you fear a tiny runt of a dog?
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Was a monster! A daemon!
Geralt|So you said. You're a stoneless coward, sir - that's that.
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Oh! Beg your pardon… I'm not a coward - I'm cautious. Know what'd become of a fire eater who paid no 'eed to caution?
Geralt|Hmm… I suppose he might singe his tongue.
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Guessed it. Settles that misunderstanding.
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Those're... excellent ears. Might try a pair like that. Just not sure they'd fit under my cap.
Geralt|Don't know how to handle yappy little dogs?
Olgierd Brother|I'd chase it off with a stick. But that strikes me as… unwitcherly.
Geralt|Effective, though.
Geralt|Job done.
Geralt|Ahh, my first witcher contract. Done.
Geralt|Fire eater - found, his arse - saved…
Geralt|If I could live again, I'd be a witcher. For damned certain.
Geralt|Keep calm, stay close.
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Shan't stray a step. Wild animals behind every stump in these woods.
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Gads! Bear!
Geralt|Bear?! That?! As much as your cock's a tent-pole. Hide, you blind fool!
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Save me!
Geralt|Tell me, are bears often boar-shaped, in your experience?
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Got weak eyes, see… Besides, I'm a fire eater, not some damned naturalist.
Geralt|Indeed you are not, master, uh… hmm, believe I failed to ask - what do they call you?
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|David Artensborrow.
Geralt|Listen here, master Hattensburrow. Stay close and no harm will come to you.
Geralt|I'll see to it your drunken, fire-spitting gob gets to the wedding safe and sound.
Geralt|Almost there. Even a buffoon like you should make it at this point.
Geralt|Ehh, I told him to hide. Bully good hider with a pup at his heels, why not now?
Geralt|No magic delights, I suppose. Best tell the bride's mother.
Geralt|Seems there shall be no tricks. We must inform the bride's mother the magician turned coward.
Geralt|My first witcher contract.
Geralt|Didn't turn out as I'd hoped. Yet I still had a cracking time.
Geralt|Coming or not?
Olgierd Brother|I'm coming, I'm coming…
Geralt|To the wedding, then. Perhaps I'll find some more interesting diversions there.
Geralt|Daemon's not half as black as they paint him.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|The missing fire blower is missing no more.
Geralt|It was my doing, if I may say so myself.
Bride Mother|And Daemon? What's with him?
Geralt|Haven't a clue. He'd chased the fire eater up a tree, so I chased him off. Assumed he'd wandered home.
Bride Mother|He hasn't. No one's seen hide nor hair of him.
Geralt|Then he's a shite poor excuse for a dog!
Bride Mother|Aye, true. Never did like the little fleabag.
Bride Father|The dog's small beer - no fire eating, that's the grief.
Bride Mother|Aye, grief, no show, oh no… What can we do?
Geralt|I regret the loss as well. But there, there, you've put on a lovely wedding even without him!
Bride Mother|You think so? Truly?
Geralt|Wholly! I haven't reveled so thoroughly in ages! You've nothing to be ashamed of. There are vittles, musicians, and all enjoy themselves - as should you.
Geralt|You marry your daughter off today. Be glad, for sadness can only bring her worry.
Bride Father|Witcher speaks wise words, my dear. Come, let's see to the guests.
Bride Mother|Yes, let's. Thank you, witcher, for your trouble. And your kind words.
Shani|It'll be midnight soon. The capping will begin.
Geralt|Then tally-ho to the barn. I must cap my night off with a last hurrah.
Shani|Just… easy with the comments, all right? Please?
Geralt|Come now, stiff upper lip. A silly sconce swiller no wedding makes nor breaks.
Bride Mother|Silly to you, but it means prestige to us. We aimed to show we're to be taken seriously, that we're more'n just milkers and ploughers and goatherds.
Geralt|A torch tonguer would change nothing. No circus performer could possibly turn a peasant into a noble.
Bride Father|You think us bumpkins?
Geralt|Never uttered the word. Yet you are not of the gentry - a simple fact.
Bride Father|Let's go, dumplin'. We're clearly not fit company for our dear lord witcher.
Geralt|Hm. I can't help but wonder - must it be a fire eater who performs? What if, instead, there was - oh, I don't know - a juggler?
Bride Mother|Just where would we find a juggler at this hour?
Geralt|But say you did, would that do as a replacement for the fire sniffler?
Bride Father|Well… I suppose it might.
Geralt|Then I shall perform!
Bride Mother|You? First I've heard of a juggling witcher!
Geralt|Today I'm no ordinary witcher. In my youth I had a great many friends among circus folk. They taught me well.
Geralt|I shall gladly save you from your troubles, now.
Bride Father|If that's the case, I'll announce the performance!
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Your attention, please! I invite all to witness a spectacle unrivaled, a man so bold as to eat fire!
Geralt|We must watch the trickery. Never saw anything like it while alive.
Geralt|He failed to return?
Bride Mother|No, he did. He's just acting mighty strange.
Bride Father|Seems to be in a muddle o' sorts. Got as much life in him as a carrot.
Geralt|Might've eaten some nightshade or whatnot.
Bride Father|Hm. Truth be told, I'd hoped a fire eater would've done somethin' more… riveting.
Bride Mother|For the coin he took, he should've ridden in on a fire-breathing dragon.
Geralt|I found your fire belcher, yet I fear he proved a common coward.
Bride Mother|What's his bravery to me? I paid him to eat fire, he need do just that.
Geralt|Sadly, he's not only a coward, but a cheat as well. Soon as I found him, he lifted his skirt and ran.
Bride Mother|And I went to such expense… What's with Daemon?
Geralt|I found your fire licker, but he gave up the ghost on the way back. Too much vodka.
Bride Mother|Just my luck to hire a drunk… And Daemon? What's with him?
Bride Mother|Last time I've paid a penny to any such parasite.
Bride Father|Told you we'd 'ave done better to spend the coin on a stove fitter than a fire eater. Our hearth's near shot.
<|endoftext|>
Shani|Hm. Perhaps you're just not my type. Considered that?
Geralt|Rubbish! I'm every lass' type.
Shani|Is that so? Prove it.
Geralt|With pleasure! Show me a lass, and I'll have her eating out of my hand in the blink of an eye!
Shani|That one. With the garland.
Geralt|Splendid choice! Now observe as Vlodimir von Everec does his thing.
Geralt|Now who have we here?
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|Do I know you?
Geralt|That's the crux of it - we've not met. I've had to endure half a lifetime without you.
Shani|An entire lifetime, more like.
Geralt|A moment, my dear.
Geralt|Do not sabotage me, Shani. That would not be fair.
Shani|Fine, fine. I'll stay out of your way.
Geralt|Ahem, my sweet, you are no mere maid, but a marvel of nature! And now, at last, fate knocks at your door!
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|But I… well… don't know, rightly…
Geralt|You needn't know anything. I know it all for us both.
Geralt|I shall make a true lady of you. Arm in arm, we'll grace the finest salons.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|Salons? But, really? Actual salons? In Novigrad? And how…?
Geralt|In Novigrad, Oxenfurt, why, in Kovir as well! Wherever you wish. Let's make haste to the barn. There everything will be made clear.
Novigrad Peasant 01|Nesky, step away from the man.
Geralt|Who the devils are you?
Novigrad Peasant 01|We're the miss' brothers. And we swore to our da on his dyin' day we'd keep those of your ilk far from her.
Geralt|You shan't keep me from anything, filthy hayseed.
Novigrad Peasant 02|Lads… mutant's callin' us names.
Geralt|Stand down, swineherds. Or lord witcher will give you a bloody mighty drubbing. Now where's a ploughing fence board when you need it?!
Novigrad Peasant 02|Show us what you got!
Geralt|Hot damn, boy! You needn't ask me twice!
Geralt|Easy, lads. No harm done. An innocent conversation with an innocent miss. The kind weddings are for.
Novigrad Peasant 02|We all heard your innocent talk. Wanted to draw her to the barn. What were you gonna do there? Talk some more?
Geralt|Naturally, we would speak, but first we would dance. Now tell me, what sort of fool wouldn't want to dance with a beauty like her?
Novigrad Peasant 01|Find another beauty! Or I'll dance with you meself - just after I grab me a fence post!
Olgierd Brother|Geralt, you saw it - I tried to resolve this peacefully, but they wish to fight. Suits me just fine - sounds like wonderful fun. Fence boards right over there for the taking.
Novigrad Peasant 03|Fear eat your stones?
Olgierd Brother|That's the last ploughing straw. No one accuses Vlodimir von Everec of cowardice!
Geralt|Calm down, boys. Don't wanna fight you.
Novigrad Peasant 03|Too damn bad. 'Cause we're gonna tan your mutant-freak hide!
Olgierd Brother|That does it. Rraa, hy-ah!
Geralt|Did it hurt terribly, my sweet?
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|What?
Geralt|When you fell from the heavens.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|Oh, hahaha. Why, sir, I-- Haha…
Geralt|Shh, my dear. No more words.
Geralt|Had enough, peasant spawn? Thought yourself a match for a von Everec -- I mean, a witcher?
Geralt|Away with you, begone! I've tired of looking at your slackjawed yaps!
Geralt|Where to, my love? I was to turn you into a lady!
Olgierd Brother|Geralt, you must explain I was not at fault. They lunged at me. Well? Go on, chase her!
Geralt|In your dreams.
Olgierd Brother|There it is. You fucked up. She's gone. Is that how you woo the ladies?
Geralt|You always that charming in life?
Olgierd Brother|It worked more often than not.
Geralt|Listen. Tongue and fists on a leash from now on. Have your fun, but don't beat the wedding guests. With my hands.
Olgierd Brother|Fine. I shall try.
Olgierd Brother|Uh-oh, Shani approaches. Unlikely to be happy, eh?
Geralt|You made this mess, you do the explaining.
Olgierd Brother|Oh, all right…
Shani|Your methods - quite unusual. To woo a woman by beating up her brothers - creative. Wonder what else you have up your sleeve.
Geralt|A hazard of the trade, my love. I'm clearly a bit out of practice.
Geralt|But point out the next young miss, and I will gladly prove I--
Shani|You've proven everything amply. Let's just have fun, all right? After all, you haven't much time left.
Geralt|Ehh, fine, I suppose you're right. Come, then.
Shani|Time for the capping. We need to get to the barn.
Geralt|Go. I require a last hurrah.
Shani|All the guests must be present for the capping. That includes you.
Geralt|Eliminating potential obstacles, see - all part of my plan. Usually, I take a few passing blows in the doing, and the young miss in question then swoons with pity, tends to my wounds…
Shani|So what went wrong?
Geralt|It's this damned malformed body. All sinews. And this mug… were I to wear my own, oh, 'twould be another story altogether.
Geralt|The maidens always fell for my melancholy eyes and the swagger in my scars… but I'll gladly try again, just indicate a lass and--
Geralt|My dear girl, what don't I have up my sleeve! I'd gladly demonstrate… perhaps behind the barn?
Shani|I think you've demonstrated enough. Let's just enjoy ourselves, all right? You don't have all that much time left.
Geralt|Your wish is my command, m'lady. I'd never deny a maid so fair-featured. Off we go.
Novigrad Peasant 01|Had enough, lordlin'?
Novigrad Peasant 03|That'll teach you to woo and dupe decent maids. Got my eye on you.
Novigrad Peasant 01|Nesky! Let's go!
Geralt|Fence boards! The perfect weapon for sweaty-arsed swineherds!
Novigrad Peasant 01|Perfect fit for your gob, you ploughin' gentle-fuck!
Geralt|Never in my life have I reveled so fiercely! Step up, who else wants a shave?!
Geralt|Damned cretin creamed me. Embarrassing to take a licking from a boor.
Geralt|And with a maiden watching…
Geralt|Ahh, so good to shake the kinks from one's bones.
Geralt|We must find more, more fun.
Geralt|Hmm, tell me, Shani - what's the key with you?
Shani|What do you mean?
Geralt|I'm on the prowl - that's clear. I woo and woo, yet you do not succumb. So I can't help but wonder - what am I doing wrong?
Geralt|I'm on the prowl - that's clear. In Geralt's name and flesh, of course, but still. Yet the more I woo you, the less you seem ready to succumb. So I ask myself - what am I missing?
Geralt|How does my heart's captor like the, uh… prize... I won for her?
Shani|The rag-stuffed piggy? It's lovely, truly. I've always dreamed of owning one.
Geralt|Forgive me, Shani. I've let you down.
Shani|Are you worried about that pig? You needn't be…
Geralt|We're here as a couple, I wanted to win you that… that thing…
Shani|Really, it's unimportant, nothing at all.
Geralt|Feel foolish, peasants? Learned a lesson from your better. Are the pigs penned? Indeed they are!
Novigrad Poor Man 01|Master witcher, we ain't seen such pig-chasin' skill in a long time.
Novigrad Poor Man 02|Your family had an ample pen, didn't they? Go on, admit it.
Geralt|My family had many pens. But that in no way means I had any practice chasing pigs.
Novigrad Poor Man 01|However it were, the crown's goin' to a good man!
Novigrad Poor Man 02|And the king's chosen maid deserves a fitting favor. Here.
Novigrad Poor Man 01|Just don't go hidin' it in some pouch. Brandish it on your horse, so that all folk may see!
Geralt|What do you say to that, Shani? Ever witness such agility?
Shani|You're clearly a natural at chasing pigs through muck. You were a joy to watch.
Novigrad Poor Man 01|Whoa, master witcher. What were the trickery back there, the fancy finger twistin'?
Novigrad Poor Man 02|I know. Seen that afore. Witcher told a lad to go hang himself. Drew some flowers in the air with his hand, and the man lost his mind.
Novigrad Poor Man 01|Meanin' you cheated. And shan't be crowned King o' the Swineherds.
Geralt|Shani? What is it Geralt says in these situations? "Dammit"?
Shani|Yes, that's it.
Geralt|Dammit!
Geralt|Now for what I say - go shove rakes up your arses, you peasant curs!
Geralt|Do I look anything like a swineherd? Come, Shani. I've had enough of these hayseeds…
Novigrad Poor Man 01|What's wrong, witcher? Swineherd's Dash no longer interest you?
Shani|We're to leave the sty? I thought you liked these gritty, manly games.
Geralt|Vlodimir von Everec never gives up! I'll try again - that crown shall be mine!
Geralt|Had enough of this swiving swining. Pigs are best as pork on your plate.
Geralt|Come away with me, Shani.
Novigrad Poor Man 01|See that? Bloke thinks our sport ain't good enough for him.
Novigrad Poor Man 02|Be singin' a different tune if he'd been any good at it.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Right y'are. Like my pa always said, "When shite can't swim, it blames the runny water."
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Poor Man 01|Look at the fools fallin' over themselves to catch a painted pig!
Novigrad Poor Man 02|Smearin' their wedding garb with muck!
Geralt|Aha! Finally, a manly man's sport!
Geralt|What sport is this? Blustering about after pigs, are you?
Novigrad Poor Man 01|Lads're racin' to be crowned King o' the Swineherds. And win the prize that comes with it for their wench - um, lady, meanin'.
Geralt|And the rules? One must be a swineherd's son to enter, I suppose?
Novigrad Poor Man 02|Naay, any man can try his luck. All you need is to herd the piggies dabbed in yellow into the pen.
Geralt|Sounds like damned foolish nonsense - but why not give it a try?
Novigrad Poor Man 01|We'd be honored!
Novigrad Poor Man 01|Get that cripple outta there! Couldn't chase his own wench into a bed, let alone a pig into a pen! Let the witcher give it a run.
Novigrad Poor Man 02|A witcher with ass ears chasing swine… hahaha. Better than a goddamned circus.
Geralt|What's that you say, peasant?
Novigrad Poor Man 02|Me? Uhhh, nothing.
Geralt|Good. Keep it that way.
Geralt|King of the swineherds, eh? And what's this king get, exactly? A king's ransom, I would hope?
Novigrad Poor Man 01|No coin. Honor's the prize. King gets a crown o' laurels he pins to his saddle, rides about with pride that he's King of the Swineherds.
Geralt|You mentioned some trifles for the lasses - are they worthwhile at least?
Novigrad Poor Man 01|For certain! Lovely, every last one, pretty as a painting! Win and see for yourself!
Shani|Shame there's no painter here. It's a moment worth immortalizing for posterity.
Geralt|Watch my movements, Shani. I'm spry as a cat and sly as a fox… I'll show these imbeciles how one chases a porker.
Geralt|You see that, Shani! One pig penned!
Geralt|Stupid swine. They infuriate me anymore, I'll whack them with some sign.
Geralt|C'mon, piggy. Got a nice and cozy pen for you.

Mirror|You must know, my dear ladies, that traditional gingerbread is not your ordinary baked good.
Mirror|It's a culinary phenomenon. A legend. A dark and obscure object of the deepest desire.
Novigrad Old Woman 02|But gingerbread's nowt but flour, honey, eggs and spices.
Mirror|I beg to differ, madame. You omit the most important ingredient in gingerbread - time.
Geralt|What sort of balderdash is he feeding them?
Shani|Quiet. If you listen, you'll learn.
Novigrad Old Woman 03|Time? What do ye mean, time? An ingredient?
Mirror|Time gives the proper consistency. Time provides that ideal crunch on the outside, the delicious moistness within.
Novigrad Old Woman 02|So how much o' this time does it take?
Mirror|That you will not find in any recipe. You must surrender to your senses. Let them lead you so close to time you touch it. Let you sniff it, stroke it, even… Time, time is the key.
Mirror|Greetings, Shani. I must introduce myself. Gaunter O'Dimm.
Mirror|My, what a lovely dress. The color suits you exquisitely.
Shani|Thanks. I've heard a lot about you, but no one mentioned cooking. Seem to know quite a bit about gingerbread.
Mirror|Quite simply, I know a lot about everything.
Geralt|Is that so? What do you know about me?
Mirror|That you were ever the worse brother. That you envied Olgierd from your earliest days and always wished to be just like him.
Geralt|I came here to revel, enjoy myself, not to discuss my brother.
Mirror|That's good. Olgierd probably wouldn't want me to talk to you about him.
Geralt|Olgierd was my brother and my friend. Never have there been more loyal comrades than us.
Mirror|The question is, were you as dear to him as he seems to have been to you?
Geralt|He made a hero of me in death! In my last battle… in truth, I was far from valiant. Five came at me. I'll not deny it, I fled…
Geralt|I hid in a cellar, yet they found me. Cornered me, like a rat. But Olgierd told everyone I flew at all five. Took them on all at once, alone!
Mirror|I'm rather curious how you know all this.
Geralt|Olgierd visits my grave. Often. Pours a drink for me, gets soused himself, and talks of the old times… he cannot see me, but I hear his every word.
Mirror|Hmm. Well, perhaps one day he'll say something veeerrry surprising…
Geralt|What're you getting at?
Mirror|I shan't disturb you any longer. Have a splendid time - for time is… time is short.
Geralt|Shani, I'm sorry, I…
Shani|It's all right. That was… Oh, forget him. We're here to enjoy ourselves, right?
Shani|Let's go. The night's still young.
Shani|The capping will begin soon. Let's take our places.
Geralt|Let's. I've got an idea…
Geralt|Rubbish! I never envied my brother!
Mirror|Of course you did. He was a shining role model. Olgierd ran faster, shot truer, lifted greater weights…
Mirror|Olgierd learned to read first, although you tried your damndest to beat him. As you grew up, he had his pick of girls, whereas you made do with the leftovers…
Geralt|I apologize, Shani. I'm rather sorry you have to hear this.
Mirror|Stop fooling yourself. Shani isn't here for you. She's here for Geralt. Even after death, you still play the pale imitation.
Mirror|Oh, by the way… Olgierd's a much better dancer.
Geralt|You lying dog! That's my brother! I loved him!
Geralt|Wait… you can see me? That is, me, Vlodimir von Everec?
Mirror|Of course, why ever wouldn't I?
Geralt|Because… I'm in Geralt's body… the witcher's… and--
Mirror|Just who would I be if the true nature of things remained hidden from me?
Mirror|Someone like you - meaning no one.
Geralt|I wouldn't want to get blood on my damsel's dress, but insult me once more and--
Mirror|You shan't touch me. I know you'd like very much to act like your brother in this situation, demonstrate how manly you are, but - let's be honest - nothing will come of it.
Mirror|You're simply not him, no matter how much you wish you were.
Geralt|I wish to talk to you. What you said about Olgierd…
Mirror|You've not heard enough?
Mirror|Go and revel while you can. The time for talk will come later.
Geralt|All lies. Not a word of truth.
Shani|Don't let it bother you.
Geralt|Olgierd was not just my brother. More importantly, he was my best mate.
Shani|Let it go. I believe you. And now revel on. Time won't wait.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Your health, sir dwarves! May your beards grow long but never tangle round your ankles!
Dwarf Man 01|Tae the young lovers! May their loins never cool!
Dwarf Man 01|May they sire many a bairn and reap gobs o' coin!
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|Drink with us!
Geralt|I never say no to a lady! To your fair beauty! And to yours, Shani, naturally!
Novigrad Poor Woman 01|Your health and happiness.
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|Fortune smile upon you, White Wolf.
Dwarf Man 01|Have a swig with us, witcher.
Novigrad Poor Woman 01|Hey there, 'ansum - drink with us.
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|Don't make us beg. We're toastin' the newlyweds.
Geralt|If I may, Shani, I'd show you how I cut a jig. Nimble as a leopard.
Shani|Don't let me stop you.
Geralt|Why, the way you move! What charm, what grace!
Shani|Thanks.
Geralt|I wager none here's ever seen a juggling witcher.
Geralt|Gather 'round, all, to behold a great wonder! A juggling witcher! The one and only!
Geralt|Look carefully, Shani! Ever seen such deft hands?
Geralt|I would love to show you what else they can do.
Geralt|So, Shani, was it to your liking?
Shani|It was positively gripping.
Dwarf Man 02|What's that yer blabbin'? Armed ruffians waylayin' travelers - they's Order men?
Dwarf Man 03|Aye, so I've heard.
Dwarf Man 03|Crack is Radovid took the Order of the Flaming Rose, purged it of the dregs, the worst of the lot not even fit for his army.
Dwarf Man 02|It cannae be…
Dwarf Man 03|So the scum regrouped, started in plyin' the banditry trade.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 02|Know Joz, lives down the hillock? They stole his wean!
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Them knights again? Order men, but gone rogue?
Novigrad Peasant Woman 02|Them's the ones.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|Damned cockanapes're everywhere. But what good's Joz's kid to them?
Novigrad Peasant Woman 02|Took him as punishment. Missus Joz held back two sacks o' grain on them.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 02|Joz came home from town, tossed the sacks on a cart and hauled them to the woods. Got the little one back only then.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|End times indeed, with such evil afoot even here…
Geralt|Columbines from Giverny... Wonder who brought them.
Geralt|Could Shani be missing Vlod?
Geralt|Flowers on Vlodimir's grave?
Geralt|Of all these flowers, you, my dear, are loveliest.
Novigrad Old Woman 01|Believe the young man's mistaken me for another.
Geralt|Not at all. I like my women as I like my peaches - fuzzy and well ripe.
Novigrad Old Woman 01|That's enough! Get goin'. You're drunk and randy. Nothin' good's ever come o' that mix.
Novigrad Old Woman 01|Git, git! Or I'll call my man over!
Geralt|Found yourself a perch from which to survey passing beaux?
Novigrad Old Woman 03|What do you mean? My back aches from poundin' the churn. So I'm havin' a rest.
Geralt|And they said fire burns hotter in an old stove!
Novigrad Old Woman 03|If I was your age, you'd be singing a different tune. Have you squealin' like a kitty cat.
Geralt|Changed your mind, my nymph?
Novigrad Old Woman 03|Won't you ever leave me be?!
Geralt|Stay out of the cellar over long, cobwebs will seal it shut. Luckily, I've a great broom…
Novigrad Old Woman 03|Agh, go nag another!
Geralt|I need but close my eyes to behold how you look when--
Shani|Best not finish that thought.
Geralt|Ehh, so we shan't visit the loft?
Shani|No.
Geralt|Rats.
<|endoftext|>
Shani|I'll leave you for a moment. As a bridesmaid I need to be by the bride for the capping.
Geralt|Go on, Shani. I'll manage fine alone.
Geralt|Ladies and gentlemen! This night I've tasted of life's delights so fiercely, I've decided to make a speech!
Shani|Geralt! There's no need.
Geralt|No need?! Why, there's every need!
Geralt|Ahem. Till now I'd always considered peasant jollities unworthy of a gentleman! For tell me, who among you would rub shoulders with swineherds if born a noble?
Geralt|I delighted in the beauty of buxom farm wenches, of course, and indeed still do. Given more time, I'd prove this to each and every maiden here!
Geralt|Farmhands are a different story. Never took any note of them. Had one or two groom my mounts. They did this well, but were never worthy of conversation - nay, not even if you paid me!
Geralt|For one must live by certain principles, am I right?!
Geralt|But this day… this day has changed all! Beneath the muck and dung, a peasant is a man! I understand this thanks to you!
Geralt|You've still shite all to talk about, but I don't mind anymore. For this I thank you. And say, you are well loved!
Shani|It's almost midnight. Time for the capping!
Geralt|Wait, I'm not done!
Shani|Oh yes you are. All the maids join in the capping!
Geralt|You're a maid too, Shani…
Olgierd Brother|A lovely custom! Blushing maids, twirling in dance, their hair swirling freely, their bodices undone, their bouncing…
Geralt|Will you stop?
Olgierd Brother|Did you see it? Shani caught the garland. She'll be next to marry as peasant superstition has it.
Geralt|Maybe. Doesn't matter. It's past midnight. Time for you to go back to the crypt.
Olgierd Brother|I can't. I'm not finished here.
Shani|Is Vlodimir's ghost gone?
Olgierd Brother|You see? She asks after me. Misses me already!
Geralt|I'm here, my ever-loving tulip.
Geralt|That kiss as we danced made my head so light, a team of hellish stallions could not tear me away before I receive one more… or two more. Or as many as you'll give.
Shani|You seem to have enjoyed yourself. I'm glad.
Geralt|A kiss! I knew it would end this way! An end that is but a beginning!
Shani|No, it's just an end. It's after midnight - your time has come.
Geralt|Bah, we needn't fret such trifles. Death's not come to claw me back, so why not continue our revels?
Shani|What's Geralt think about that? You gave your word.
Geralt|Shani, darling… I'm dead. Can't expect too much from a corpse.
Mirror|Vlodimir von Everec - go back whence you came. Please.
Geralt|Stay out of this.
Olgierd Brother|Stop! I beg you, stop!
Mirror|Get ye hence, or I'll take you with me, and your moldy crypt will look like paradise in comparison. The choice is yours.
Olgierd Brother|Aaaargh!
Geralt|Don't torture him.
Mirror|I promise he'll not die, heheh.
Shani|Gods, what is this?
Geralt|What did you do to him?
Mirror|Sent him back whence he came.
Shani|I hope you didn't hurt him.
Mirror|I disposed of a pest. There was no need for you to suffer his cheek any longer.
Mirror|Geralt had finished his task, you see, so--
Shani|Yes, I know. As soon as he finishes one task, he needs to rush off to the next.
Mirror|Who knows, perhaps this time will be different? I saw you looking at each other. And it just so happens I also know the history you share…
Shani|You do? How?
Mirror|Shani, darling… would you ask an eagle how it knows how to fly?
Mirror|Regardless… what matters is Vlodimir von Everec will bother you no more.
Geralt|Should get back to Olgierd soon.
Shani|And like that, it's over. Huh, here I thought I might get some more time with you. Silly, wasn't it?
Geralt|Wouldn't say that.
Shani|Never mind. I should find Aldona. I am her bridesmaid, after all.
Mirror|Ah, there it is. The face of a man who's failed to understand a woman.
Geralt|You understand her?
Mirror|Of course. Women are simple. The problem is that men are hopeless fools.
Mirror|Your friend will now make a show of being hurt. Pick her some flowers or bring her a drink. She'll get over it in a snap.
Geralt|Rather manage without your advice, thank you.
Mirror|She cares for you, you have feelings for her. Don't overthink it. Surrender to spontaneous honesty - nothing more beautiful in human relationships.
Mirror|You needn't end like Aldona and Johnnus - besotted fools bound by a contract they'll never escape.
Mirror|Seize the night, seize your chance. Enjoy one another - that's it. Have fun.
Geralt|I'd like to stay longer… but…
Shani|Don't make excuses, Geralt. I'm not angry. A witcher has to ply his trade, follow his Path.
Shani|As for me, well… perhaps I expected too much of this wedding, got the wrong impression.
Geralt|Not sure I understand.
Geralt|Didn't have to make him suffer.
Mirror|Of course I needn't have.
Mirror|But I could.
Geralt|Thanks, not sure I could've stood him much longer.
Mirror|At your service. Always.
Shani|It's past midnight. You can take off those lovely ears. Only if you want to, of course.
Geralt|Lovely as they are, think I'll put them away for now.
Geralt|So be it. If there's no demand, I shan't supply. But it would have been a beautiful speech.
Shani|It's almost midnight, time for the capping.
Geralt|You're a bridesmaid, Shani - take your place.
Bride Father|The midnight chime has struck, the capping time's a-come! What thoughts in young hearts prance, what dreams make young blood run?
Bride Father|Be they nice, be they vice, of jesterly or lordly stance, out they'll come in this hour's dance!
Wedding Band|Let's toast the lovely couple, but afore a year shall pass, we'll toast a little bairn, who's lovelier by half.
Wedding Band|But ne'er you mind our singin', ‘tis only meant for laughs, a pretext and a ruse, so we can drink a glass.
Wedding Band|The bride has sworn her vows, but the groom still best beware, lest in the coming year, two horns on head he'll wear.
Wedding Band|What's got our groom a-thinkin'? He's so gloomy now. Perhaps he's second guessin', if he'll get that cow?
Wedding Band|You'll get your cow, my lad, and calves and milk and all, So merry make and drink, for ‘tis your wedding ball!
Bride Mother|Be happy, daughter dear.
Bridesmaids|Gar-land, gar-land, gar-land!
Bride Mother|As hallowed tradition holds, whoever caught the garland shall be next to wed!
Geralt|That really necessary?
Olgierd Brother|It came rushing back in a torrent - how we caroused at Olgierd's wedding.
Olgierd Brother|I couldn't resist, had to pen a few words. Will you give him the letter?
Geralt|I will.
Olgierd Brother|Thanks. You're a good chap, witcher. Dull as dirt, but good.
Drunk Wedding Guest Man 01|Heheh - witcher's talkin' to himself. Must be damn sloshed, eh?
Drunk Wedding Guest Man 01|And good on it! Gotsta get drunk at a weddin'!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Don't be sad, Shani.
Shani|I'm fine, really. And you were going to see Olgierd.
Geralt|Don't like it when you're glum.
Shani|I'm not. Have you seen Olgierd? Told him you fulfilled his wish?
Geralt|Pretty, I guess. Thing is, will it cheer her up?
Geralt|Fine, I'll pick some. Becoming quite the romantic…
Geralt|Think I'll pass.
Novigrad Old Woman 01|A lad clutchin' stems is a lad caught at mischief… They never think to offer blooms 'less their stones're in a vice.
Geralt|A rowan… Shani mentioned she used to weave the berries into necklaces.
Geralt|Rowanberry brandy… Shani loves the blossoms, might enjoy this as well.
Geralt|Chamomile, looks like.
Geralt|Good mead oughta lift her spirits.
Geralt|A sip of something strong never hurt anyone. Question is, will it cheer her up?
Geralt|Here's hoping Shani's a happy drunk.
Geralt|Good idea? Maybe not. She might be a sad drunk.
<|endoftext|>
Shani|Still here? Thought you had to meet Olgierd.
Geralt|You and I see each other so rarely. Figured Olgierd could wait till morning.
Geralt|Brought you some mead. Best medicine for a troubled soul.
Shani|Thanks.
Geralt|Wedding's still in full swing, but your face - I'd say you were at a funeral. Why so sad?
Shani|Sad? Not really. It's just, after I caught the garland I realized something.
Shani|The years're flying by, yet all I ever do is study, pump stomachs, and reattach limbs. All alone.
Geralt|You got me.
Shani|For how long? A day, two? Don't get me wrong, it's nice, but… you come and go. Yet I need someone who'll be there every night when I come home. After a day of bandaging wounds and sewing up guts, I need a good glass and a good laugh with someone who'll help me forget it all for a moment…
Geralt|I get it. And yeah, could never be there for you everyday. But I am happy to see you always. And today, I'm all yours.
Shani|Hm, well, in that case let's drink to tonight.
Geralt|To tonight. May the moment last.
Shani|I'm afraid the drink's gotten to our minstrels. Horribly off-key.
Geralt|Let's go for a walk.
Shani|Good idea.
Shani|Did you enjoy the wedding?
Geralt|Not exactly my idea of a good time.
Shani|What is?
Geralt|Time I spend with people I know.
Shani|You know me.
Geralt|True. And now I'm starting to enjoy this.
Geralt|Kinda like Vizima - remember? You, me, Zoltan, Dandelion, endless drinking binges…
Shani|And the Catriona plague.
Geralt|That was background. What I remember most - the mood, the feelings, the people I met… and those I met for the second time in my life.
Shani|You're right. I was up to my elbows in work, but those were good times. They're nice memories.
Geralt|For me, too.
Groom|You needn't worry about our finances, sir. My workshop? Business is boomin'.
Bride Father|Good, I'm relieved to hear it. See, coin's tight at our end. But don't tell the old battleaxe. She'd be furious if she learnt I let it slip.
Groom|Never you worry, sir. My lips're sealed as the grave. Us menfolk need to stick together.
Bride Father|"Sir," "sir!" Hahah, enough o' that! I'm Vassy. But you can call me "da."
Groom|Oh, thank you, da. I feel honored. Let's drink on it!
Shani|Seems the families are bonding.
Geralt|A bride's father and his son-in-law? Stiff at first, but add drink and they bond or slap each other silly.
Shani|I was afraid the wedding wouldn't happen at all.
Geralt|Mean the differences in wealth?
Shani|Mhm. Johnnus' family didn't consider Aldona worthy.
Geralt|Clear they love each other, though. Parents usually give in if that's the case.
Shani|Oh, I don't know. My mother would never accept an "unfit" beau. Even if I insisted I loved him, had chosen him.
Geralt|What kind of beau's "unfit"?
Shani|Ah, so far, every kind.
Geralt|You only ever bring home fiddlers, jugglers and witchers?
Shani|Hahaha. No. But she'd want me to choose someone wealthy, or with a good trade, well brought up.
Geralt|Nothing wrong with that, is there?
Shani|Uh, I guess not. But it's hard to find one like that who's still even slightly amusing.
Geralt|That's probably true.
Shani|Tell that to my mother. She actually thinks I should've found a husband at the Academy.
Shani|But I didn't. Ugh, I'm certain she thinks there's something horribly wrong with me.
Geralt|Oh please, Shani.
Geralt|It's the thirteenth century. Women don't go to the Academy to find a husband. They go to learn, pursue their passion. You did that. I'm sure your mother appreciates it.
Geralt|You got a doctorate, have your own practice, been at the front lines many times. You're a good person. Not a thing wrong with you.
Shani|Really think so?
Geralt|Really.
Geralt|Look. The brave brothers.
Shani|Drank themselves stiff as the boards they tore from the fence.
Geralt|Wonder where the sister is. Couldn't protect her from a cheeky four year old in their condition.
Shani|If they hadn't intervened, you'd have gone for tumble in the hay with her. She was willing, if you ask me.
Geralt|I wasn't in the mood. Would've resisted, tried to regain control.
Shani|I think you would've seized the opportunity.
Geralt|I don't need opportunities like that.
Shani|Changed your style?
Geralt|Let's say I've grown choosy.
Shani|You say that as if you've already picked.
Geralt|Cause I have. Guess who?
Shani|Ooh. Gorgeous.
Geralt|Been thinking about that kiss.
Shani|What kiss?
Geralt|The one Vlodimir planted on your lips… with my lips. Just wondering if it would've felt any different without him there.
Shani|That I cannot tell you.
Geralt|Only one way to find out.
Shani|So, how'd it compare?
Geralt|Definitely rather kiss you alone, of my own free will.
Geralt|Correct me if I'm wrong, but I do believe Vlodimir was after more than a kiss. Said so openly, in fact.
Shani|Mh, all true. He was very direct, I'll give him that. Which on occasion has its advantages…
Geralt|You're right. Can save a lot of time.
Shani|So how do you stand today, Geralt? Have some time to waste with me, or would you rather go back now?
Geralt|Not going back, but not about to waste any time, either. Gonna use every minute wisely.
Geralt|And I aim to be direct, even more so than Vlodimir.
Shani|Sounds interesting.
Geralt|Interesting is what interesting does.
Shani|Rats, pier's taken…
Geralt|Got a feeling it's about to free up.
Shani|How did you know...?
Geralt|I'm clairvoyant.
Shani|Mh, practically full…
Geralt|Be a shame to let it go to waste.
Shani|Besides, we leave it here, a very drunk person could find it - drink themselves into even more trouble.
Shani|And I swore a solemn oath - “First of all, do no harm.”
Geralt|To yourself, either.
Shani|You're right. I shouldn't mix.
Shani|I hope they don't see you drinking their wine.
Geralt|Got their hands full at the moment.
Shani|Uh, they could finish quicker than you think. Catch you with your hands full.
Geralt|Let's hide.
Shani|Row me to the Moon.
Geralt|Gotta fly to get to the Moon.
Shani|You're dead wrong. Look, it's right there! In the middle of the lake!
Shani|What're you doing?
Geralt|What one usually does on the Moon.
Geralt|Awake already?
Shani|For a while now. Did you know you've gained twenty-seven new scars since we last saw each other?
Geralt|Keeping count?
Shani|Hm… I do that sometimes.
Geralt|Did we make it to the Moon?
Shani|Forgotten already?
Geralt|Nah. Not the sort of thing you forget.
Shani|Exactly…
Geralt|Sound like you wish you could.
Shani|No. Certainly won't forget that, and I definitely don't regret it. But I do need to sort it all out in my head. Alone.
Geralt|Shani, wait!
Geralt|Before you go… need to ask you a favor.
Shani|Yes?
Geralt|It's about Olgierd. Seems a mysterious man. Can't escape the impression his story's more complicated than I thought.
Geralt|Could you look into it? See if you can learn something?
Shani|Sure, be glad to.
Geralt|Thanks. Be seeing you.
Shani|Yes, see you later, Geralt.
Shani|Sorry…
Geralt|Was it that bad? Or have you developed an allergy for me?
Shani|Had too much to drink.
Geralt|You're the medic. Recommendation?
Geralt|Hey, leave some for me.
Shani|We need to drink fast. Before they catch us.
Shani|Come on, let's hide.
Geralt|Promised you this night. Aim to keep my word.
Geralt|Love to stay, I would. But we oughta get back to the wedding.
Shani|Yes… yes, that's best.
Geralt|Penny for your thoughts?
Shani|Just thinking that friends should stay friends.
Geralt|Mhm. My feeling, too.
Shani|I have a lot to think about. Alone. So, I'm not going back to the wedding. Not really fond of watching drunks stagger around, anyway.
Geralt|Honestly? Completely different.
Shani|Better or worse?
Geralt|Definitely prefer kissing you without Vlodimir's help.
Geralt|Just… impossible to compare.
Geralt|I couldn't have done anything, sadly, but somehow, I think I would've survived.
Shani|I think so, too. I imagine you've lived through worse than a tryst in a barn with some milkmaid.
Geralt|Definitely. A tryst in a barn would be a much more pleasant experience than a fight in a manticore's den.
Geralt|That was Vlodimir, not me. Remember.
Shani|But pretend for a moment it had been you. And the situation had been different.
Shani|Say you're at the wedding, and that very girl keeps glancing, smiling at you. Then she finally walks up, and you know exactly what she wants.
Shani|What do you do?
Geralt|Hmm. If Dandelion was around, and he usually is, I'd introduce her to him and walk off.
Shani|I don't believe that. You'd let the opportunity pass?
Geralt|Hmm. Put it that way, and I guess I don't really have a choice.
Shani|A witcher never lets an opportunity pass, is that it?
Geralt|No. He does… if he spots a better one nearby.
Geralt|Doubt your mother's that unbending. You'd win her over, I'm sure.
Shani|I haven't managed to yet.
Geralt|Though, in fact, I did start having fun when I kissed you.
Shani|Thought that was more Vlodimir's doing.
Geralt|Epidemic's long forgotten, sure. But the romantic bits in that adventure - don't plan to forget those.
Geralt|Not half bad. Might've even enjoyed myself if I hadn't had to argue with a madman's ghost, be his puppet.
Geralt|Gotta admit, though - thanks to him I did experience a lot of things I might've missed otherwise.
Shani|Mean chasing a dog through the woods, or brawling fence board in hand?
Geralt|Forgetting something. There was also a kiss.
Shani|True. Though that was so clearly Vlodimir, I nearly forgot you were involved at all.
Geralt|You've got friends. Me, for one.
Shani|In that case, let's drink to our friendship.
Geralt|To friendship.
Geralt|Seemed to like the rowan. Thought you might want to try another form of it.
Shani|I liked to make necklaces out of the berries, but… guess I am curious how this will taste.
Geralt|Smile, Shani.
Shani|You brought me… chamomile?
Geralt|Not a girl out there doesn't like flowers, right?
Shani|Can't speak for other girls, but chamomile is tea to me. Thanks, maybe I'll boil them tomorrow morning.
Geralt|Smile, Shani.
Shani|You remembered I liked the rowan.
Geralt|Remember a lot of things about you.
Geralt|His will, sure, but my body. Felt everything. Reminded me of the old times.
Shani|Uh, Vizima, you mean? Oh, I thought you'd forgotten our whole Catriona story.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Fulfilled your wish.
Geralt|Your dead brother had himself one more day like those of old.
Olgierd|Very easy to say. But have you got any proof?
Geralt|I do.
Olgierd|Vlodimir's hand… It's unmistakable.
Olgierd|You've done well, witcher.
Olgierd|Is that all, or have you something else?
Geralt|Gonna work on getting you Borsodi's House next.
Olgierd|Best of luck. Enjoy.
Olgierd|Need something else?
Olgierd|Need something else?
Olgierd|Got anything else for me?
Geralt|I do. Also took care of Vlodimir.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|This the Borsodi brothers' auction house?
Auction House Guard 01|Seems it.
Auction House Guard 02|Private Kleiner. You're on duty - need I remind you? Fraternizin' with civilians is not allowed.
Auction House Guard 02|Purpose of your visit?
Geralt|Any of the owners home?
Auction House Guard 02|Meanin' the one and sole owner - the esteemed Horst Borsodi? Aye, he is.
Geralt|Need to talk to him.
Auction House Guard 02|Order 76-CW-X is clear - auction's only open to folk with invitations… writ out in their names, plain and simple.
Geralt|Gonna let that hold you back? Come on…
Auction House Guard 01|Afraid you're outta luck. Order 76-CW-X also held that Lance Corporal Vatslav stick a broomstick up his arse.
Auction House Guard 02|Kleiner! Need I remind you of the penalty for insulting a superior?!
Vimme Vivaldi|Wha--? Who do I spy! Geralt? Geralt of Rivia?
Geralt|In the flesh. How long's it been, Vimme? Usury still your passion and profession?
Vimme Vivaldi|I prefer the term "savin's and loan bankin'" - but all in all, aye, that's how my preference lies.
Vimme Vivaldi|What's all the fash, Corporal Vatslav? Are you squabblin' with my pal Geralt?
Auction House Guard 02|Master Vivaldi, sir, your esteemed associate - he weren't invited… to the auction. And I've--
Vimme Vivaldi|But I ploughin' have been. And he's comin' with me. In you go, Geralt.
Auction House Guard 02|But-- My orders--
Vimme Vivaldi|Fuck yer orders. Need I take this up with the sergeant? Hah! I thought not! Now, stand to attention! And shut yer geggy!
Auction House Guard 01|Oh, the lads'll be rollin' back at the barracks.
Auction House Guard 02|Shut it! Now march! Round you go! One! Two! One! Two!
Vimme Vivaldi|Who have we here! Geralt, the witcher of Rivia!
Geralt|Vimme Vivaldi, the banker from-- Actually, where are you from?
Vimme Vivaldi|Matters little, mate. Gold knows no boundaries.
Geralt|Make an exception - that's the smart thing to do.
Auction House Guard 02|Threats don't scare me. I've sworn to serve Redania, till death do us part. And I'll keep my oath - with a song on my lips!
Auction House Guard 01|Careful. Bugger means it.
Auction House Guard 02|Gaaaaude, Maaaater Redaaaaniaaaa, prooole fecuuuunda nooobiiiliiii!
Geralt|Just curious - Redanian army regulars, right?
Auction House Guard 02|Lance Corporal Vatslav reportin'! And this bloke's my subordinate, Private Kleiner.
Auction House Guard 01|Careful you don't piss yourself out of excitement.
Auction House Guard 02|You say somethin', soldier?!
Auction House Guard 01|Not a thing.
Geralt|Shouldn't you be somewhere? There's a war on, you know.
Auction House Guard 02|We was transferred here, all official. Written order 76-CW-X. Mission - guard the auction house. Priority - high, top, in fact.
Auction House Guard 01|Borsodi fellow knows his way about the court. Helps the high-rankin' sell their war booty, heheh. Gets protection in return.
Auction House Guard 02|Private Kleiner! That's confidential military information!
Geralt|See you.
Auction House Guard 02|Aye, farewell. Private Kleiner! Attehhhn-shun!
Auction House Guard 01|Ugh…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Appreciate the help.
Vimme Vivaldi|Twas nowt. I've always had a mind to seein' to old pals and clients!
Geralt|Business with you's a pure pleasure, Vimme.
Vimme Vivaldi|The dear departed wifie claimed the same.
Vimme Vivaldi|Ahah! Folk're assemblin' - auction's about to start. Time we went upstairs.
Geralt|Actually, I'm really just here to talk to Horst Borsodi.
Vimme Vivaldi|Oo. Might be more of a problem than ye'd expect.
Geralt|Because?
Vimme Vivaldi|An awful hermit, that one. Not a wee bit like his da, Melitele keep his soul…
Vimme Vivaldi|Buuut, Horst is like tae show his heid durin' the auction. I'll introduce ye then.
Geralt|Be mighty indebted to you.
Vimme Vivaldi|Think nothin' of it! I only ever collect on loans and promissory notes. All right, up we go!
Geralt|What'd folk come to bid on? Any idea?
Vimme Vivaldi|All kinds o' valuables, rare weaponry, exotica… But I've got my eye on a selection of canvasses by the master portraitists of the Maribor School - van der Knoob and Longendijk.
Geralt|Well, well. Never knew you to be a connoisseur.
Vimme Vivaldi|Cause I'm not! It's all muck and rubbage tae me. Point of fact, I'll just wrap 'em in paper and lock 'em in the vault.
Geralt|Why in the world do--?
Vimme Vivaldi|What do ye mean, why, Geralt? I've got to diversify my investments, dinnae I?!
Geralt|Could've sworn the Borsodis' auction house was in Novigrad.
Vimme Vivaldi|It was, but they moved it. Ye see, Radovid offered Horst a preferential tax rate - zero percent.
Geralt|Hm. Pretty much unbeatable.
Vimme Vivaldi|Aye. And I've nae seen a purer example of the benevolent state!
<|endoftext|>
Vimme Vivaldi|Hm. Auction won't start for a time yet, it seems.
Geralt|Vimme, this is a banquet.
Vimme Vivaldi|Aye. And?
Geralt|I detest banquets. Vacuous conversation, food portions fit for a mouse, drinks that taste like piss…
Vimme Vivaldi|Ach, it won't all be bad. Let me introduce ye to some o' my most interesting associates.
Vimme Vivaldi|Old hen there's Countess Mignole. Wager ye'll have plenty to blather about with her… Prick in the corner's Hilbert. New coin, that one. Came intae a right fortune playin' gwent.
Vimme Vivaldi|Ah, there's Yaromir, art dealer. A purer snob I've never known, but he knows paintings like no other.
Vimme Vivaldi|So, ready to chat someone up? It's not fittin' for us to stand here like knobs…
Geralt|Agh…
<|endoftext|>
Vimme Vivaldi|Hilbert! It's been years. Allow me to introduce youse… Geralt of Rivia.
Geralt|Enchanted.
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Pleasure's all mine.
Vimme Vivaldi|How's it? Got yer eye on any sparkly bits the day?
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Not really. I buy what strikes me fancy. I need something right sumptuous for me walls, just now.
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Nilfgaard. I get it right?
Geralt|Excuse me?
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Your gwent deck - it's Nilfgaard, innit? Come on, admit it.
Geralt|Seen right through me.
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Hah! I knowed it! You don't look like one who easily agrees to a draw.
Vimme Vivaldi|You ought to know, Hilbert - Geralt here's a positively superb player. Su-perb!
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Hm. We got a minute afore the auction starts, so… nudge nudge wink wink - maybe a round?
Geralt|Hm. Suppose it's not whether you win or lose… Sure, I'm game.
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Brilliant! I'll lay my cards out.
Vimme Vivaldi|Naturally. Geralt… might I have a wee word?
Geralt|What is it?
Vimme Vivaldi|Well, mate… seein' as I brought youse together, I do believe I'm owed a share of your winnings, if there are any. Ten percent? A finder's fee o' sorts, ye ken?
Geralt|Mhm. Pretty clear now why you wanted us to meet.
Vimme Vivaldi|One cardinal bit I've learnt in my trade, friend - coin dinnae stink. So, what'll it be?
Geralt|Awfully resourceful of you, Vimme. I'm impressed. Gotta refuse, all the same. No offence.
Vimme Vivaldi|Dinnae make a fuss now. I'm a dwarf and a banker, so I've doubly thick skin. Good luck to ye!
Geralt|All right. Game on.
Geralt|Well, you did help with the guards at the door… All right. Ten percent of any winnings is yours.
Vimme Vivaldi|Any chance for fifteen?
Geralt|Don't push it, Vimme.
Geralt|Sorry. Another time, maybe.
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Hm. It is what it is. I'm off for a nosh. By the by, watch those little black balls. Strange, them.
Vimme Vivaldi|Agh, to spurn the caviar of the Koviri sturgeon! They're castin' pearls before swine!
Vimme Vivaldi|Come, Geralt. Let's have a blether with another.
Vimme Vivaldi|Skinned me of my prime card, he did, imagine that! One you gave me as collateral a time back!
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|I've heard. Tourney at the Passiflora. Sat in on that, didn't you?
Geralt|Mhm. Pretty special as events go.
Vimme Vivaldi|That were nothin'!
Geralt|Frankly, I usually play my monsters.
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|A witcher who plays monsters? Hm, interesting.
Geralt|Not a bad deck, Nilfgaard, but… I'll take the Northern Realms over it any day.
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Ah, understood. A patriot!
Geralt|Crap guess. Scoia'tael's my favorite.
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Right, right. A solid knock to your foe - nothing like it, eh?
Geralt|Frankly, don't find gwent the least bit interesting.
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Oh? Shame, that.
Vimme Vivaldi|Good to see ye again, Hilbert… Time we were goin'. Listen, if ye decide to buy intae that fund we discussed, ye know where to find me!
Geralt|You call that interesting?
Vimme Vivaldi|Bloke's not scintillatin' in conversation, I'll grant ye, but he's a right fiend at the card table. No matter, maybe next time.
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Well, what's it you want?
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|By my reckoning, that Countess Mignole's just a mad old bat!
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Unbelievable! I don't buy it! You cheated, you must 'ave. Something! Hexed me or whatnot!
Vimme Vivaldi|Oo, I'd be careful with the gab, Hilbert… Afore Geralt takes a mind to demandin' satisfaction.
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Pff! You give it to 'im, you damn midget! You bearded pinchfist!
Vimme Vivaldi|Oo, interest'll be a right bit higher when that bugger next comes round askin' for a loan.
Geralt|Speaking of percentages… your share, Vimme.
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Egh, ain't about to play you no more!
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|You're not at all bad. But it ain't enough to outplay me.
Geralt|That so? How about a rematch?
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Apologies, mate, but I only ever play any bloke once. Vah file, as them pointy-ears say.
Vimme Vivaldi|Aww! Hard luck, Geralt. Yer cards, though - ye find them in the crapper? Didnae line up, did they?
<|endoftext|>
Vimme Vivaldi|Greetings to the honorable Countess! Madame, allow me to introduce my dear friend, Geralt of Rivia.
Countess Mignole|…witcher of the School of the Wolf.
Geralt|Forgive me, but have we had the pleasure…?
Countess Mignole|No. But your guild is unmistakable. Your medallion…
Vimme Vivaldi|Take note, Geralt. Countess Mignole is an eminent collector of vedyminaica.
Geralt|Vedymi- what now?
Countess Mignole|All manner of objects related to the witcherly profession. Swords, gear, medallions.
Geralt|Does the Countess have her eye on anything particular today?
Countess Mignole|No. But Horst Borsodi insisted he would put up something that would be of interest.
Vimme Vivaldi|Did he happen to say what it was?
Countess Mignole|No. Oh, you know what he's like - a walking enigma.
Countess Mignole|On another topic… Master Geralt, I was wondering if you'd be willing to help a lady in need?
Geralt|Depends on the nature of the need.
Countess Mignole|Oh, it's quite the trifle. I stepped out onto the balcony a moment ago. I dropped an earring while there. I couldn't find it - it must have fallen through the floor boards. Perhaps you, with your cat eyes…?
Geralt|Not a problem. I'll go right away.
Countess Mignole|I shall be much obliged!
Geralt|See you in a minute, Vimme.
Geralt|Forgive me, Countess. But if there's no monster on the balcony, it's just not something I should bother with.
Countess Mignole|A pity. But I understand. The Witchers' Code.
Vimme Vivaldi|Really. You're swine, ye know? Finding an earring - what's that to you?
Geralt|Ah, Vimme... The countess didn't lose an earring. Her ears aren't even pierced.
Vimme Vivaldi|That's right! So what's she on ab--?
Geralt|Don't know, don't want to know. Don't need to get involved in yet other scheme.
Geralt|Mind if I ask how the Countess became interested in us humble monster slayers?
Countess Mignole|I've some pleasant associations. Dating from my oh so distant youth.
Vimme Vivaldi|Dinnae ye say such things, Countess! Ye look right fetchin' to me!
Countess Mignole|That's very kind, Master Vivaldi, but apart from my vedyminaica I also own a number of mirrors.
Geralt|Your most prized piece - what would it be?
Countess Mignole|An armor element, an antique. School of the Wolf. From 1234.
Geralt|Classic! Is it up for sale?
Countess Mignole|I fear not. It's a memento, one of great sentimental value.
Vimme Vivaldi|But perhaps the Countess's got other witcher curios she's willin' to part with? Or acquire. Perhaps ye could trade? I'd charge… five percent - a modest, uh, transaction fee.
Geralt|Vimme, never seen anyone so good at laying their mitts on coin that clinked within earshot. But what the hell… see if we can't make a deal.
Geralt|Vimme, afraid you'll have to finagle your coin out of someone else today.
Geralt|Countess, forgive us. Time we were on our way.
Countess Mignole|So soon? A great shame. Whatever the reason, I wish you luck on the Path.
Vimme Vivaldi|Where you headed in such a rush?
Geralt|To the door. Sooner we finish up here, the better.
Countess Mignole|I'd like to be alone, if you don't mind.
Countess Mignole|You've my utmost respect, master.
Countess Mignole|You remind me of one I used to know…
Geralt|…
Geralt|There's no earring out here, is there?
Countess Mignole|None.
Geralt|Maybe the Countess'd care to explain what this is about? All jokes aside?
Countess Mignole|Forgive me, I-- Gods, this is so embarrassing!
Countess Mignole|Do--? Do you know Vesemir? He was a tinge shorter than you, wore a mustache…
Geralt|Do I know him? Man taught me everything I know!
Countess Mignole|What--? How is he, if you don't mind my asking?
Geralt|Vesemir's fine, the picture of health. And he still wears a mustache.
Countess Mignole|I'm relieved to hear it. And, hm, did he ever find a… a mate?
Geralt|No. Haven't seen him with a woman in five decades. Me and the other witchers, we often wondered what his story was.
Countess Mignole|A pity. A pity our story didn't end differently. I might have… I should have ridden out after him.
Countess Mignole|Please don't mention me when next you see him. I've reopened my own wounds. That's enough.
Countess Mignole|I thank you for tolerating a decrepit madwoman so elegantly.
Geralt|Please don't say that.
Countess Mignole|I am old and I am wealthy. I may say what I please. And now, be so kind and leave me to my thoughts.
Geralt|Huh, afraid I have bad news…
Countess Mignole|Oh!
Countess Mignole|Please, tell me… did he at least die like a witcher?
Geralt|No. He died like a hero.
Countess Mignole|Hhh, there is that…
Geralt|Don't mind at all. But before I answer, I also wouldn't mind knowing how you knew each other.
Countess Mignole|Oh, I've told no one. Not ever. But I suppose I owe you an explanation.
Countess Mignole|It was the winter of 1234. A beast prowled the streets of Oxenfurt. A fleder, I believe. A contract was issued, a notice posted, and a witcher appeared. Vesemir. Of the School of the Wolf.
Countess Mignole|He came through our estate, tracking the beast. Our eyes met, something sparked. I wrote him a message, asked my governess to deliver it.
Countess Mignole|He visited, under the cover of night, night after night. On one such occasion my father heard something. Vesemir had to flee, so quickly he left behind his gambeson.
Geralt|Ah! The first piece, the start of your collection.
Countess Mignole|Yes. But also the end of our love. Father had an arrest warrant issued, then quickly married me off. I was fortunate - my husband died young, leaving me a sizeable fortune. And thus… I have lived on memories.
<|endoftext|>
Vimme Vivaldi|Yaromir? Might we trouble ye a wee spell?
Redanian Noble 02|Mhm. Greetings, Vivaldi. Who's this?
Geralt|Geralt of Rivia. Witcher.
Vimme Vivaldi|Thought ye might have a blether with us. Aboot the paintin's on the block today. Hm?
Redanian Noble 02|Ah, sniffing for a quick turnaround as usual, are we?
Vimme Vivaldi|Pot callin' the kettle black, I'd say. Do a lively trade in canvasses yerself, my friend.
Redanian Noble 02|True. Yet first they delight my eyes. Whereas you treat them as mere promissory notes. The only arts that interest you are those culinary.
Redanian Noble 02|What about you, witcher? Do you know anything about paintings?
Geralt|Realize this might be hard to believe, given my crude-looking mug, but yeah - I know a thing or two.
Redanian Noble 02|Truly? We ought to see what.
Redanian Noble 02|Do you know our friend Vivaldi is in possession of five canvasses by van der Knoob? Yet he cannot distinguish them from landscapes at five crowns apiece.
Vimme Vivaldi|I shan't pretend it's otherwise.
Redanian Noble 02|Yet for you, my dear connoisseur witcher, that should present not the slightest problem. So do tell, which of these is the handiwork of Edward van der Knoob, the master from Maribor?
Geralt|Hm, the pastoral scene, I think.
Redanian Noble 02|Incorrect. But I suppose I might've expected your gaze to look homewards to the country… Adieu.
Geralt|What a jackass.
Vimme Vivaldi|Ah, fuck him. Typical aristocunt. I've grown accustomed.
Geralt|The panorama of Novigrad, I'd say.
Redanian Noble 02|Pff. There's not a bumpkin who does not know van der Knoob never ventured outside Maribor. Adieu.
Geralt|Ugh, really? Merchant with the pearl, no two ways about it.
Redanian Noble 02|My, my. Who would have thought? Hm, might I have a word in private?
Redanian Noble 02|Forgive me my impertinence. At first I thought you an ignoramus, Vivaldi's equal.
Redanian Noble 02|I feel I should apologize and atone, so I shall tell you a secret. A van Rogh is due to appear on the block. The painter's unknown, largely, but has a fierce admirer in Marcus Hodgson, a bookseller, has his shop in Novigrad's main square. I wager you'll sell him the canvas at a tidy profit.
Geralt|Thanks.
Redanian Noble 02|Think nothing of it. Now please excuse me. My friends beckon.
Vimme Vivaldi|So? What did he tell ye?
Geralt|To buy the van Rogh. Apparently, this bookseller in Novigrad's willing to pay top coin for his work.
Vimme Vivaldi|Oh? Who'd 'ave thunk.
Vimme Vivaldi|All right. Let's go. Ink spot upon ink spot - sheer number of them's doin' my heid in!
Geralt|Ah, nothing special.
Vimme Vivaldi|Truly? Hm. Shame, that.
Geralt|Hm, the still life?
Redanian Noble 02|Of course not. That's a Longendijk. The palette, the brushwork… Obvious from a mile away! Adieu.
Geralt|The battle piece, if I'm not mistaken.
Redanian Noble 02|You err. Deeply. I bid you adieu.
Geralt|Hm. Gotta admit - haven't the foggiest.
Redanian Noble 02|You needn't have said it. Your crude-looking mug, as you put it, radiates ignorance. I bid you adieu.
Geralt|No. I'm more interested in the culinary arts, too.
Redanian Noble 02|Why stand near me, then? You ought to be hovering about the buffet.
Redanian Noble 02|Not now, witcher.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Rich Woman 01|I believe I'll bid on that Gourbet landscape.
Novigrad Rich Woman 02|A landscape? You detest them.
Novigrad Rich Woman 01|Ever true. But it's got a lovely frame.
Novigrad Rich Woman 01|No sign of Borsodi…
Novigrad Rich Woman 02|Perhaps he'll look in at intermission.
Novigrad Rich Woman 01|Has he always been such a recluse?
Novigrad Rich Woman 02|No. It began after his father passed. Apparently, he turned inward.
Novigrad Citizen Man 02|Ugh. The Borsodi House is going to the dogs, by gods.
Novigrad Nobleman 02|But why would you say so?
Novigrad Citizen Man 02|Look around, man. Look who he admits. A nonhuman, the nouveau riche, and-- there! There! A mutant!
Novigrad Nobleman 02|I beg your pardon, but… well, have we met?
Novigrad Citizen Man 02|I don't believ-- Wait! Indeed. What's it been - two years, perhaps three? A decorative sword - we both bid on it!
Novigrad Nobleman 02|That's right! At that auction - all the lots were from the estate of that family. Starts with an "e." Erevec? Erebec?
Novigrad Citizen Man 02|Oh, unimportant. I'd rather hear how that sword's served you.
Novigrad Citizen Man 02|Vivaldi… Perusing the room for any and all to fleece.
Novigrad Nobleman 02|These contemporaries - I simply don't understand their art.
Novigrad Rich Woman 01|That would look splendid in the boudoir.
Novigrad Rich Woman 02|Psst! The cat-eyed one - that's Gerard of Rinbe. I've heard many tales.
Novigrad Rich Woman 01|Is it my imagination, or does Baronet Lupin look a bit out of sorts today?
Novigrad Rich Woman 02|You've not heard? His sawmill's gone up in smoke! Some knights of the Order of the Flaming Rose, they say.
Novigrad Citizen Man 02|You jest! They're honorable men who serve the one god.
Novigrad Nobleman 02|King Radovid apparently stripped them of that service. They've found other employ.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Esteemed ladies, gentlemen! Kindly take your places, the auction will begin shortly!
Vimme Vivaldi|Och! At last. Come to the fore with me. I won't see nowt otherwise.
Geralt|Vimme, listen. Forgot to ask you - how's this auction going to work?
Vimme Vivaldi|They'll bring out three lots to start with. Once they've sold - or not - there'll be an intermission. Horst Borsodi'll probably appear then. That's when I'll introduce youse.
Geralt|Counting on it.
Vimme Vivaldi|In the meantime, have ye got a budget? Ye prepared to bid?
Geralt|Course I will. Went to the trouble to sneak me in here, I'd be an ass not take a stab.
Vimme Vivaldi|Hah! I knew the bug'd get ye!
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Esteemed ladies and gentlemen! Welcome back! I hereby open the auction!
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Lot number one.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Five hundred going twice! Going thrice! Sold!
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Do I see three hundred? Who will give me three? Ah! Three hundred from the monocled gentleman!
Novigrad Nobleman 01|I congratulate you on your successful acquisitions and invite you to partake of the refreshments during the intermission.
Vimme Vivaldi|So how goes it, Geralt? Didnae find it irksome, I hope?
Geralt|Course I did. As always with sophisticated company. But, it was about what I expected, so…
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Ladies and gentlemen! Lot number one is a brass figurine from the collection of the infamous Count Romilly. Rumor has it the figure harbors a treasure inside. A rumor one may prove or disprove solely by destroying the beautiful bauble itself.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Starting price - quite the bargain at fifty crowns. Any advance?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|With Master Hilbert at one hundred!
Novigrad Nobleman 01|To Countess Mignole now at one hundred and fifty. Do I hear two hundred? Might I have an advance?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|The white-haired gentleman enters a bid of two hundred! Do we have two fifty?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Two hundred once! Twice! Thri--!
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Splendid! Countess Mignole bids two hundred and fifty! Do I hear three hundred?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|My, my! This is lively! I've three hundred! Going once!
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Going twice! Do we have three fifty?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Three hundred thrice! And sold to the white-haired fellow! Lot number one, the mysterious brass figurine!
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Proceeding now to lot number two. A canvas by the young Novigrad artist van Rogh, "Starry Night Over the Pontar." Charming piece. Truly a bargain at… twenty crowns.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Ladies and gentlemen, twenty crowns! It's practically naught!
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Yes, the gentleman with the cat eyes. At twenty! Do I hear thirty?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Twenty going once, going twice, going thrice…
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Sold! Van Rogh's "Starry Night Over the Pontar" to the gentleman with the cat eyes!
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Lot number three, ladies and gentlemen - a true rarity, scarce as hens' teeth!
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Spectacles, a frame of gold, mountain crystal lenses polished by the tiny dextrous hands of the gnome masters. Once the property of the famed hired assassin known as the Professor!
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Starting price of two hundred crowns! Anyone tempted?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Gwent maestro Hilbert offers an advance of fifty! Do I have three--
Novigrad Nobleman 01|My! Haven't we livened up! Three hundred from Yaromir Ivanovitz Zaytsev! Going once! Twice!
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Incredible! With the white-haired gentlemen now, good folk, at three hundred and fifty crowns!
Novigrad Nobleman 01|A generous offer, indeed. Any advance? Three fifty going once, going twice…
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Sold! Invaluable spectacles to the white-haired gentleman! Exceedingly glad they'll be useful, may they serve you well, sir!
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Oh, the excitement! With the three lots behind us, we'll go to an intermission. Amenities abound, please partake. We'll resume shortly.
Vimme Vivaldi|Geralt, I hope that painting's no source of grief. Quite the opportunity, that.
Geralt|Mhm. Couldn't pass it up.
Geralt|…
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Brilliant! With the gentleman with the white hair now at three hundred and fifty!
Geralt|What? I didn't--
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Three-fifty once!
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Three hundred fifty twice! And three--
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Four! Four hundred now with Countess Mignole! Any advance on that?!
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Going once, twice, thrice… and sold! The Professor's spectacles go to the countess!
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Oh! We've a bidder, cat-eyed no less! At twenty! Do I hear thirty?
Vimme Vivaldi|Forgive me, Geralt, but business is business.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Thirty! From Vimme Vivaldi! Do I see forty anywhere?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Thirty going once, going twice…
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Aha! The white-haired gentleman bids forty! Who will bid more?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Forty once! Forty twice!
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Vivaldi the banker's not about to give up easily. Fifty! Any advance on fifty?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Fifty going once! Going twice! Last chance, ladies and gentlemen…
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Oh! We've a right bidding war here! Sixty! The excitement! An advance on sixty?!
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Sixty going once!
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Sixty going twice!
Vimme Vivaldi|Och, all yours, Geralt.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Sold! "Starry Night Over the Pontar" by van Rogh to a proud new owner - the king of Novigrad financiers, Vimme Vivaldi!
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Good folk, is no one tempted? Atypical in style, true, but worthy of the vestibule, surely!
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Do I hear ten crowns? A mere ten?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Ah! At last, a buyer! Ten crowns once… twice… and going thrice!
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Lot number two, "Starry Night Over the Pontar" - sold to Master Yaromir!
Vimme Vivaldi|Thank ye for the tip, Geralt.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Yes! The banker Vivaldi bids twenty crowns. Going once. Going twice.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Going once! Twice! Going thrice!
Novigrad Nobleman 01|The honorable Yaromir enters a bid of three hundred! Any advance on three? Three hundred going--
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Countess Mignole at three fifty! Going once! Twice!
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Lot number one, the mysterious brass figurine - sold! To Countess Mignole!
Geralt|Hmm, if you think you can spot me a couple hundred…
Vimme Vivaldi|O' course, pal! And at a very favorable rate of interest! Just one crown on ten when ye pay me back.
Vimme Vivaldi|Here. Ought to do you for a bit of dafferie. Happy huntin' to ye!
Geralt|Monster hunting doesn't pay all that well. Think I'll let you wealthy folk play. I'll wait in the back.
Vimme Vivaldi|Och, Geralt. You and yer saggin' coin pouch. A financial advisor, that's what ye need.
Geralt|Finances - that's actually what I'm lacking. Don't worry about me, go. I'll see if there's any caviar left.
Vimme Vivaldi|Och, Geralt, look! Horst Borsodi. Come on afore some other cocksuckers steal him. Just-- Well, don't expect a warm welcome.
Vimme Vivaldi|Greetin's, Horst! Allow me to introduce a dear friend and associate - Geralt of Rivia, who--
Horst Borsody|…comes uninvited.
Geralt|Forgot my manners. Forgive me. The teachings at Kaer Morhen, well, etiquette wasn't high on the list. Scandalous.
Horst Borsody|Mhm. That's plain to see.
Vimme Vivaldi|Eheheh-eh, got the distinct impression the two of youse started off on the wrong foot. Perhaps we should raise a toast to--
Horst Borsody|What's one like you want from one like me?
Geralt|Right, let's dispense with the niceties. Maximilian Borsodi's House - gotta lay my hands on it, whatever it--
Horst Borsody|What?! Where did you learn of it?!
Vimme Vivaldi|Gentlemen! No reason to lose our composure, raise our voices, heh.
Horst Borsody|I ask you - where did you learn of it?!
Geralt|Whoa. Come on, now--
Horst Borsody|Where?!
Geralt|Doesn't matter. Willing to tell me what it is, or not?
Horst Borsody|Guards! Escort the witcher out! And he's not to enter, not alone, not hand in hand with Hierarch Hemmelfart!
Vimme Vivaldi|Honestly, he asked a question, it were a simple inquiry.
Horst Borsody|One more word and I shall move my accounts to the competition.
Vimme Vivaldi|Sorry, mate, but…
Geralt|No reason to trouble the guards, Horst. I'll go willingly.
Horst Borsody|I don't recall giving you a choice in the matter. Kick his swiving mutated arse out!
Geralt|From Olgierd von Everec. Name mean anything to you?
Horst Borsody|It does.
Geralt|The Borsodis' Auction House - I'm assuming the name's no coincidence. Got a relative I could talk to? Someone - how do I say this - a smidgen less irritating?
Vimme Vivaldi|Haha, ahem. Name's a historical legacy, Geralt. Auction house was founded by two brothers, Horst's father and an uncle. In this generation--
Horst Borsody|I and only I am it. So get to the point. Now.
Geralt|Exactly, pretty serious oversight. I see no reason why the faux pas should taint our new-found acquaintance.
Horst Borsody|Acquaintance? I honestly don't know what you think this is, vagrant.
Geralt|But you've gained by my presence. Dropped a hefty pile of crowns here.
Horst Borsody|I'm not like Vivaldi. Profit alone only goes so far for me. I seek more. The auction house is primarily a meeting place for the local elite.
Horst Borsody|I needn't tell you an itinerant mutant doesn't quite fit in.
Vimme Vivaldi|Och, Geralt. It's nothin' personal, but I've this principle, got to have it. I dinnae extend additional loans to existin' debtors. You still owe me two hundred crowns, remember?
Geralt|Hm. Yeah, that.
Vimme Vivaldi|But, ye'll bid anyhow, won't ye? If only for sport?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Greetings, ladies, gentlemen, and the rest.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|We've an exceptional auction ahead, dear folk.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Not in the mood for your peasant wisdom. Who the hell are you?
Ewald Borsody|If all goes well, daresay I'm your partner.
Geralt|Don't need any partners.
Ewald Borsody|Oh, I don't know about that. No chance you'll lay your hands on Max Borsodi's House alone.
Geralt|Hm, how'd you know I was looking for the House?
Ewald Borsody|I was at the auction. Disguised, of course. That argument on the topic was hard to miss.
Geralt|Get to the point. If you can.
Ewald Borsody|To get this house, you need to get into the vault. And there's no way Horst'll let you in there out of the kindness of his heart.
Geralt|A heist? Don't like that idea one bit.
Ewald Borsody|Got any others?
Ewald Borsody|Find the herbalist lives near Oxenfurt. Ask for some yarrow extract. He'll know why you've come.
Geralt|If this is a trap of some sort…
Ewald Borsody|Be seein' you. I hope.
Geralt|Really think you can help me?
Ewald Borsody|We can help each other.
Auction House Guard 03|Your swords, master. Law says we're to return them.
Auction House Guard 03|Law don't say when, though. So we'll do it, aye, just after we beat the singing shite out of the honorable gentleman.
Geralt|Mhm. Gathering place for the elite, truly.
Geralt|Come on, lads. Let's loosen our muscles a bit.
Auction House Guard 03|Argh… Ugh…
Geralt|Law says if you see someone hurt, you should summon a medic.
Geralt|Law doesn't say how fast, though. So you can sit tight a while.
Ewald Borsody|Seems true what they say - "Sword or no sword, a witcher brings gore."
Auction House Guard 03|Your swords, master. Just need you to sign here.
Geralt|Fu-- Fuck you.
Auction House Guard 03|Mmm. Depositor… refused… to confirm receipt. Signed Sergeant Figgner.
Auction House Guard 03|A pleasant day to you.
Ewald Borsody|Seems true what they say - "When it's many against one, even a witcher's done."
<|endoftext|>
Ewald Borsody|You've come. Good.
Geralt|Remains to be seen. Aimed to tell me something, I think, so talk.
Ewald Borsody|How do I put this… We share a goal. We both need to get into the Borsodis' vault. Both want something that's in there. Why not pool our strengths?
Geralt|Sorry, but what exactly is yours?
Ewald Borsody|I've a plan.
Ewald Borsody|…
Ewald Borsody|Spent the last year working on it - on paper. Time to set it in motion. You one I can count on?
Geralt|I'm not a thief.
Ewald Borsody|It's opportunity makes the thief, witcher. I speak from experience.
Geralt|Ugh. Talk.
Ewald Borsody|Twenty Redanian soldiers guard the auction house. Day and night. Patrols walk in circles around it, and here, past this corner - barracks.
Geralt|Brute force is out. Gotta get in quietly.
Ewald Borsody|Exactly. Not the simplest thing, though. Main entrance - armored door. Windows - dimeritium bars.
Ewald Borsody|But, not a fortress out there without a weakness. This one's no different.
Geralt|Patience happens to be my weakness. So dispense with the dramatic pauses and talk.
Ewald Borsody|Ahem. Beside the house stands a tower, from which we can enter the attic. We can't hope to enter the tower from the street on account o' the patrols. But there's a window sixty feet off the ground. No shutters, no bars.
Ewald Borsody|We've got to get up there and sneak across to the auction house. Then down the stairs to the cellar. Crack open or blow off the vault door - and voilà.
Geralt|Not all bad, except… sounds like a lot of work for two.
Ewald Borsody|I'm fully aware of that.
Ewald Borsody|For this to work, we need two more accomplices. One to scale the tower, drop us a line. The other to open the vault - a safecracker or a demolition specialist.
Ewald Borsody|I've already identified some promising candidates. All we've to do is select and recruit the best among them. Also your job. I'd, uh, prefer to remain largely out of sight.
Geralt|Mhm. Assumed as much given your hood. Anything else?
Ewald Borsody|Aye… But that's among the details. Which you will learn just as soon as you declare.
Geralt|Agh, don't really have any other options. So be it. I'm in… but on one condition - no one dies. That clear?
Ewald Borsody|As the Great Sun of Nilfgaard. How about we knock back a round - toast a mutually beneficial relationship?
Geralt|Rather get to work. What comes first?
Ewald Borsody|First you've to assemble the crew, then… there's the Redanian patrols to cull a bit. Too many wanderin' round, we could get noticed.
Geralt|All right, I'm off. Got a bit to do.
Ewald Borsody|As do I. Get it all done, and we'll meet back here.
Geralt|What then?
Ewald Borsody|Then we'll bugger Horst up, down and sideways. All together.
Geralt|Break-in artists - tell me about them. Assuming lack of vertigo to be the first requirement.
Ewald Borsody|Mh. Precisely why my favorite's Eveline Gallo, a circus artist known better as "The Ermine." Just now performing with her troupe somewhere near Oxenfurt. Her specialities - rhythmic gymnastics and tightrope walking.
Geralt|Uh, breaking and entering?
Ewald Borsody|Not officially, no, but… I've compared the route her troupe's taken with a list of the most audacious thefts in recent years. A perfect match. Highly doubt that's a coincidence.
Ewald Borsody|But if she's reluctant, we've another option in Hugo Hoff, alias "Beef Patty." A halfling.
Geralt|Think he's fit? Pudgy face - doesn't really match my image of a criminal.
Ewald Borsody|You'd be surprised. Hugo's notched up more break-ins than you've felled monsters. More importantly, two years past he nicked the gold-plated cock from the roof of the town hall in Novigrad. So, the half-man's a climber.
Ewald Borsody|Word has it he's holed up in Oxenfurt in a house near the Novigrad Gate. Be careful. He's modest in size but apparently wicked dangerous.
Geralt|All right, opening the vault - who do we have?
Ewald Borsody|Let's start with the fact that one of 'em's a dwarf.
Ewald Borsody|Casimir Bassi, native of Mahakam. A specialist in controlled explosions. Folk say he could blow Novigrad to the high heavens with but a pinch of saltpeter. Vault door for him should be a cinch.
Ewald Borsody|The problem is Casimir apparently hung up his detonators some time ago. He married, sired some littler ones, and settled in the village of Alness. Might plain turn us down.
Geralt|Any options?
Ewald Borsody|Quinto. The North's most famed safecracker. Arrest warrants out on him in Kaedwen, Lyria, Angren and Kovir. Sadly, he got nabbed a few days back. By one Hans of Cidaris, a prick mercenary.
Ewald Borsody|As far as I know, his troop's made camp east of Oxenfurt, on the right bank of the Pontar.
Geralt|Hm. So I'd have to rip one from his cozy home, the other from a cozy cage. Need to think about it.
Geralt|Ah, right, the famed Hans. Went out with his pals to hunt monsters. Turned out they were shit at it. I know the man.
Geralt|I know the man. Slew an archgriffin for him. Mean fiend, pretty much.
Ewald Borsody|Hans or the beast?
Geralt|Both, actually.
Geralt|What's this about culling the patrols? Told you - no one dies.
Ewald Borsody|Easy. I don't want anyone's death. Just need some folk to be temporarily indisposed.
Geralt|Spit it out.
Ewald Borsody|You've got to approach the garrison's cook, convince him to spike the soldiers' nosh with somethin' to keep some of them bedridden. One in two, let's say. Wouldn't want to raise suspicions.
Geralt|Hmm. Know the formula for a potion that might do the trick.
Ewald Borsody|There, see? Brew up a bit o' that, hit the town, find the cook, then convince him to do you a favor. I don't know, cast a spell, toss him some coin… you could also use your fists.
Geralt|Hm. Gotta give it some thought.
Ewald Borsody|I get that. Think it over. You know where to find me.
Geralt|Looks bleak to me. Tower wall's smooth as glass. Don't know about you, but I can't scale that, and--
Ewald Borsody|And I've not asked you to. Let me finish.
Geralt|Come on. I don't even know your name.
Ewald Borsody|What's that matter?
Geralt|Matters 'cause you're clearly hiding something. Not just from me, either. Wouldn't be sitting in a cellar in this shithole otherwise.
Ewald Borsody|We've all some stain on our conscience. But I've not asked for your hand in marriage. Just for your help in a heist.
Ewald Borsody|We break in, each take what we need, then go our own ways.
Geralt|Try to trick me anyway, anyhow, you won't go anywhere, you know that. 'Cause I'll take your head off right where it meets your neck.
Ewald Borsody|I'm aware of the risks. So, now that you've threatened me and all… are you in or are you not?
Geralt|Before we go any further - you even know what Max Borsodi's House is?
Ewald Borsody|I know it's in the vault.
Geralt|Didn't answer my question.
Ewald Borsody|Neither have you. Willin' to help with the heist or not?
Geralt|The vault - what's in there for you?
Ewald Borsody|Something that was stolen from me.
Geralt|Hm. Oughta go to the City Watch, tell them a crime's been committed. Not organize a heist.
Ewald Borsody|I've tried. Repeatedly.
Geralt|I see. Cheated by the system, wronged by the world. Doesn't matter. What'd they take?
Ewald Borsody|List'd take a good while… so I'd rather change the subject. You in, or not?
Ewald Borsody|Well, you've returned. What's this mean? Decided to join me after all?
<|endoftext|>
Elf Man 01|Then let's return their coin to them.
Circus Artist|What would you return? We've spent it all! Every last copper!
Elf Man 01|Well… you could, you know, find more.
Circus Artist|Of course, that's your solution! That's always your solution!
Circus Artist|The minute we're in trouble, you make me responsible for getting us out. As in Maribor! Remember Maribor?
Elf Man 01|Dove, please don't change the subject.
Geralt|Mind if I do?
Circus Artist|That depends. Who might you be?
Geralt|Geralt of Rivia. Witcher. You Eveline Gallo? "The Ermine"?
Elf Man 01|Only to friends.
Circus Artist|Calm down, Meryn, no need to puff up. And you, talk - what do you want?
Geralt|Rather talk eye to eye.
Elf Man 01|Eveline conceals nothing from me, and--
Circus Artist|And you were to help set up the benches. Immediately.
Elf Man 01|But--
Circus Artist|Very well, once again - what do you want?
Geralt|Got a job for you.
Circus Artist|Truly? Of what nature?
Geralt|Hm. Anonymous performance. No audience. At a certain auction house.
Geralt|Pay's as much as you can carry.
Elf Man 01|Eveline, I beg you… You don't know him!
Circus Artist|What's that supposed to mean? He introduced himself, did you not hear? Geralt of Rivia.
Elf Man 01|Stop pretending you don't understand me. You cannot know if he's to be trusted!
Circus Artist|Not a soul can be trusted.
Circus Artist|Hm. You've none of a fink's features. But you see, I've a problem.
Geralt|Lemme guess - there's a monster needs killing.
Circus Artist|Somewhere, certainly - but not here. May I finish? Or would you rather keep guessing?
Circus Artist|See, we were to do a show. The tickets have all sold. Alas, our friend and colleague, "Hawkeye" Vann… well, he's gone blind. Drank some hooch from a questionable source. A sad story, but not the point.
Circus Artist|The crowd awaits. So either we find a replacement for him, or we shall have to return the coin. All good and fine had we not spent it already.
Geralt|Ah. I think I know where this going.
Circus Artist|Then I shall get straight to the point. Stand in for Vann, and I shall help you.
Geralt|What do I have to do? Jump through some flaming hoops?
Circus Artist|No. Shoot your crossbow, hit a target.
Elf Man 01|Eveline, I'm not certain that's a good idea.
Circus Artist|Neither am I. It shall all come out in the wash. So, witcher - what'll it be?
Geralt|Not a bad shot with my crossbow. Why not. I'm in.
Circus Artist|Splendid! So, shall we begin? Folk have grown nervous.
Geralt|What? Mean now? No rehearsals?
Circus Artist|What's there to rehearse? You're to shoot and hit a target!
Elf Man 01|Hit it square on.
Geralt|All right. Do or die. Let's begin.
Circus Artist|That I like! A man who boldly dares, damn the risks! Come!
Circus Artist|And now, good folk, the highlight of our program! Standing before you - Geralt of Rivia! Victor of marksmanship contests in Angren, Dol Blathanna and Lobinden!
Novigrad Boy 01|Wow! Prime!
Geralt|What? But I--
Circus Artist|Shh, Geralt. Grab your crossbow and get to work!
Geralt|Gimme a minute. Need to prepare.
Geralt|Fine. I'll pay.
Circus Artist|Ho, ho. You must really need my help.
Geralt|Admit that freely. First off, though, I hate making a fool of myself in front of the rabble.
Circus Artist|So, what now? Might we prepare for the other show?
Geralt|Herbalist, has a hut near here. Ring a bell? Go see him and ask for some yarrow extract.
Circus Artist|Oo, a mystery. I adore mysteries. Till later, witcher!
Geralt|Got a hideout, herbalist's hut near Oxenfurt. Stone's throw away. Ask for extract of yarrow - he'll let you in.
Circus Artist|Hm.. Couldn't you just take me there?
Geralt|Hm. Why not. Let's go.
Geralt|Got some matters to tend to first. Rather meet you there.
Geralt|I'll let you know.
Circus Artist|Hmm. Very well. I shall be waiting.
Geralt|Hm, maybe I could just give you the coin for the refund? It'd be quicker. How much would that be?
Circus Artist|Hmm… let's see. Roundabout four hundred crowns, I believe.
Elf Man 01|Hm. More, I think. I put it at six hundred at the least.
Circus Artist|What? But I checked this morning and-- Aaaa.
Circus Artist|Indeed, Meryn's right. Six hundred crowns.
Geralt|Hmm… Steep.
Circus Artist|So perhaps you'd prefer to help with the show?
Geralt|Know what? Need to think this through.
Circus Artist|Well, if you must, you must.
Geralt|All right, out with it. What's this problem?
Circus Artist|Have you thought it out?
Circus Artist|We end with an audacious feat by Geralt of Rivia! We thank you for attending and hope to see you soon!
Novigrad Boy 01|It's a shame that man didn't shoot the elf. That would have been brilliant!
Elf Man 01|You know, I doubted I'd emerge from that ordeal in one piece. Fine work, Geralt.
Circus Artist|Well, one performance down. What of the next?
Elf Man 01|Argh! He hit me! The bastard hit me!
Novigrad Boy 01|Woooooaaah! Brilliant!
Circus Artist|Ladies and gentlemen! With that, errr, singular feat we bring our performance to a close! See you all soon!
Geralt|Gonna live?
Elf Man 01|Yes, I shall live! Argh… Out of my… sight, imbecile!
Geralt|Sorry. Told you I'm not a bad shot, not a perfect one.
Circus Artist|Oh, don't fret. Vann would miss occasionally, too. I shall patch Meryn up.
Circus Artist|Oh? Back so soon? Well? Will we do it?
Circus Artist|Finally, you're back. So, what's it to be… our next performance?
Circus Artist|Well? Ready?
Circus Artist|This promises to be very interesting…
Circus Artist|When are we to start?
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Peasant 01|Nowt? Sold us tickets, they did. Shiteaters.
Novigrad Peasant 02|Could've apologized, the least.
Novigrad Poor Woman 03|Meh. Artists - thievin' scum an' whores, every last one of 'em!
Novigrad Poor Woman 01|Folk say there's a rubbin' woman 'midst this troupe.
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|A rubbin' woman? What's she do?
Novigrad Peasant 03|You know. The kind that bends, does splits, wraps her legs round her head.
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|Ah! A rubber lady! Tasteless however you cut it.
Novigrad Peasant 01|Wonder if they need a new elf come every show.
Novigrad Peasant 02|Most like. Just go to the forest an' trap 'em, like rabbits.
Novigrad Peasant 01|Gods ha' mercy!
Novigrad Peasant 03|Shoot him smack in the noggin, the mangy squirrel! Hehehe…
Novigrad Poor Woman 01|I can't watch this! Tell us when it's over!
Novigrad Poor Woman 03|Pfff. I could do that.
Novigrad Peasant 02|Were I that elf, I believe I'd plain shit in my trousers.
Novigrad Poor Woman 01|Were I that witcher, I wouldn't aim for the apple!
Novigrad Poor Woman 03|Aye! Pointy-ears've shot droves of ours from the brush. Retribution, I say. Give 'em a taste of their own medicine!
Elf Man 01|Are you completely daft?
Elf Man 01|Well, what's the hold up? Shoot!
Elf Man 01|Aim for the apple! The apple!
Elf Man 01|Are you cross-eyed or what?!
Novigrad Peasant 01|What're you doin' here, Nemuel? Not at work?
Novigrad Peasant 02|Afeared I'm out a job. Sawmill burnt down - thanks to the good knights of the Order of the Flaming Rose.
Novigrad Peasant 01|First I've heard. What now?
Novigrad Peasant 02|Agh, nothing. 'Twere monsters, we could hire a witcher. But none'll drive off those tin men.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Gone batshit barmy, he has. I told youse it'd end this way!
Demolition Dwarf|Fidelity, she swore! Love! What of it? Crushed heart, stones and cock, that's what!
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Master Casimir! Toss aside the torch, ee gads!
Demolition Dwarf|Aaaaa, piss off then fuck off! Ye'll not tell me what to do!
Geralt|Wha-- What's going on here?
Novigrad Peasant 01|Intit plain? Master Casimir's sat upon his roof. Claims he'll blow hisself to bits!
Demolition Dwarf|Bought the wench pearls! Silks, satins! And how the fuck's she repaid me? Made me a heidbanger cuckold!
Geralt|I'll try to talk some sense into him.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|An' if he should grow angered?
Demolition Dwarf|Wench demanded a canopied bed! And got it! Silver tableware, she said! Got that, too!
Demolition Dwarf|Lackin' nothin'! Not a thing! What the fuck else was I tae give her?!
Geralt|Doubt he can grow any angrier.
Novigrad Peasant 01|Hail Melitele, our hallowed mother. Keep us from evil….
Demolition Dwarf|What kind o' knob you got?! Likely come to poke my Euphemia, eh?! Well, ye're late! She's gone!
Geralt|No. I jus--
Demolition Dwarf|Postmaster said the same! Denied it all, swore on the balls of his gods! And the eejit I am, I believed the bugger!
Demolition Dwarf|Three years they bumped about under my nose! Then ran off! My granda told it right! Not a bloke out there doesnae want to get 'tween a dwarf wench's trotters!
Geralt|I commiserate, honestly.
Demolition Dwarf|Aaah, talkin' out yer fanny flaps!
Geralt|No, no, seriously. I--
Demolition Dwarf|Aye?! Seriously?! Couldn't give a hedgehog's arse for me or my troubles! Ye're as boggin' a liar as Euphemia!
Demolition Dwarf|Think ye can dupe me with yer sweetened mincin', eh? Oh, no! No! That was that!
Geralt|Casimir, no!
Geralt|Care to set that torch aside? So we can talk this out? Calmly?
Demolition Dwarf|Calmly?! Calmly?! Wench tossed me aside, took the weans, and I'm to be calm?!
Demolition Dwarf|The country, she says! Fresh air's what I need, she says! So we came out here! Anythin' for my bunny!
Demolition Dwarf|Cept 'stead of suckin' air, she sucked off the postmaster! In my ploughin' bed! I cannae take it no more!
Geralt|I'm sure you know the saying - plenty of fish and all. You'll find another.
Demolition Dwarf|Another?! Is that yer take, that one wench'll do for another?! That I'll take any, so long as she's got a full beard?!
Geralt|No, but in my experience--
Demolition Dwarf|Fuck yer experience! We're talkin' about my experience, mine! Agh, I've had my fill of this shite!
Geralt|No. No, wait!
Geralt|Forget about it. Listen, got a job for you.
Demolition Dwarf|Forge--! Forget it?! Here I'm barin' my soul, and ye're gonna talk me up about work?!
Demolition Dwarf|Ye're all the same! We dwarves, we're born tae muck about in the mines! Bend our necks 'neath human yokes! Ye dinnae give a duck's cock about it, ye ploughin' racists!
Geralt|Come to think of it, doubt you're fit for the job. Not in that state.
Demolition Dwarf|What?! I'm not fit?! What the fuck ye sayin' I'm not fit for, ye cocksucker?!
Geralt|I'd need you to blow something up, open. But--
Demolition Dwarf|And I'm no fit for that?! Me, Casimir Bassi, top mine foreman in Mahakam?!
Geralt|More like top cuckold in Redania, now.
Demolition Dwarf|Top--?! Cuck--?! Whaaaaat?! You wait, ye cur, ye rogue, ye dick heid! You just wait!
Geralt|Agh, know what? Go ahead, blow yourself up.
Demolition Dwarf|What did you say?!
Geralt|I see it now. You're fucked. If it's too much, if you're too soft, can't handle it, that's that.
Demolition Dwarf|What?! Me, Casimir Bassi, mine foreman from Mahakam - soft?!
Geralt|Works out that way. No balls, forgot 'em somewhere.
Demolition Dwarf|I've no--?! Me? No balls?! You just wait, ye rotter, ye scum bag, ye pricklicker! I'll show you!
Geralt|Know what? You're pathetic.
Demolition Dwarf|What?! What the fuck did you say?!
Geralt|You heard me. Wanna die? Go jump off a bridge. Instead of scaring folk shitless.
Demolition Dwarf|Lookie here! Got us a clever one! Tellin' me how to off myself!
Geralt|Even willing to help you. No chance you'll do it on your own. You're not just a cuckold, you're a coward.
Demolition Dwarf|Me?! A coward?! I'll not listen to this tripe! Don't ye go nowhere, ye bastart! I'll tie yer ball bag round your neck!
Geralt|Get down. Now.
Demolition Dwarf|What? Aw-- Comin'. I'm comin'.
Demolition Dwarf|So, uh, ahem - what is it you wanted?
Geralt|Want you to open a door. Permanently, so it won't close again.
Demolition Dwarf|I see. And what might ye find on the other side of this door?
Geralt|A reward. Big one. To be split. Enough for everyone.
Demolition Dwarf|If ye'd come a week past, I'd 'ave sent ye the fuck away. But now, now I've nothin' to lose. What's it I'm to do?
Geralt|Hut of the herbalist who lives near Oxenfurt. Go there and ask for yarrow extract. Learn all you need to know. Clear?
Demolition Dwarf|As a Mahakaman highland stream. See ya.
Geralt|Herbalist who lives near Oxenfurt. His hut. Go there and ask for yarrow extract. Learn all you need to know. Clear?
Demolition Dwarf|And might you be headed there about now? 'Cause if so, we could head there together, eh?
Geralt|Hm, actually wouldn't mind some company for the slog.
Demolition Dwarf|Aye, that! And I can teach ye a cheery tune what to keep the spring in our step! It starts like this…
Geralt|Need to tend to something on the way. So we'll meet there.
Geralt|I'll let you know.
Demolition Dwarf|What?! I was a minge hair from takin' my life. Now ye give me with the gab of a wench from personnel at a manufactury?! "Dinnae call on us, we'll call on you?!" Ye pure mad dafty?
Demolition Dwarf|Now talk, and don't ye swick me! Ye givin' me the job or not?!
Geralt|Yeah, yeah - you got it. Now calm down.
Geralt|Know what? Changed my mind. Think we'll both be better off--
Demolition Dwarf|I'm of no use to a witcher, either. Argh! Shite luck, that. Shite life.
Geralt|Dammit.
Geralt|Huh. A falling out in the family?
Novigrad Peasant 01|Aye! His Euphemia, she were fine, pretty as a picture, you might say! An' five bairns they has.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|On the short side, but so well mannered! Always bow, ask after your health. Not at all grumpy like the ealdorman's laddies.
Novigrad Peasant 01|Till the day Euphemia bundled up her belongin's and their bairns. Tossed 'em all on a wagon, and that's all we seen of her!
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Master Casimir's been pure yampy since - bawlin', whingin', now this!
Demolition Dwarf|This'll be one for the ploughin' annals! Goin' out with a bang! When this fuckin' blows, they'll see the fires in Novigrad!
Demolition Dwarf|Och. Aah! Ye bruised my bones, right splintered 'em!
Geralt|Sorry. Would've preferred to talk it out. Thing is, you gave me no choice.
Demolition Dwarf|Nay, dinnae apologize. I needed somethin' o' the sort. Some fella tae knock the muck out o' my heid. Argh…
Demolition Dwarf|Take that! And that, ye bugger! For Euphemia! For the weans! For the canopy!
Geralt|Stop! Stop it! Don't make me hurt you!
Demolition Dwarf|Sorry. I was consumed, pent up, ye ken? Feel better, now. Laid my fists to a punchin' bag. Cooled off.
Demolition Dwarf|Och… I cannae waiit to fuckin' blast it wide!
Demolition Dwarf|Ach, if only my heart were whole and held dear. Maybe once I'm flush with coin?
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Whoa, mate. Stuck your prick where you shouldn't have.
Geralt|Hey! Anyone in there?!
Geralt|Blood? Hm. This does not look good.
Geralt|Tracks lead to the water. Dammit.
Geralt|Hugo's sleeping with the fish. No two ways about it - gotta find Eveline.
Geralt|Blood… still moist. Nothing beyond that.
Geralt|Trail ends here… or continues underwater.
Geralt|Blood. Someone knocked their head on this beam. Open cut.
Geralt|Bare feet. Fresh prints.
Geralt|Looks like Hugo ran into trouble. Gotta find him. Fast.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|You Quinto?
Safecracker|The one and only. A pleasure, but who might you be?
Redanian Officer 01|Whoa, ho! I'll have no pleasure here! Witcher, keep clear of the cage, right?
Geralt|I need Quinto. Alive.
Redanian Officer 01|And I need coin. Lots of it.
Redanian Officer 01|Lucky thing I don't much care who pays me - you, or the bankers.
Safecracker|Meanin' Master Hans of Cidaris' moral spine is rather bendy.
Redanian Officer 01|You'll be the one with the bendy spine in a minute! I said, shut your mouth!
Redanian Officer 01|Where was I? Right. Want me to let him go? Pay up. Same as the wanted posters say.
Geralt|Hans, to claim that reward, you've gotta deliver Quinto to the right hands. Seems a… complication.
Safecracker|Time's a consideration. And we all know time is coin.
Redanian Officer 01|Shut it! What's your point, witcher?
Geralt|Bankers are far away. Whereas I'm here, saving you a lot of trouble. Think you should drop the price.
Redanian Officer 01|Hrmph. By how much?
Redanian Officer 01|Don't know about that, Geralt. Takes good will to negotiate. Afraid I've none of that for you.
Geralt|Call it my loss. Here.
Redanian Officer 01|Ah, nothin' quite like the weight of a purse full o' gold. Right, Quinto - you're dumb as shite, but lucky as--
Safecracker|…
Redanian Officer 01|Wha--? But, how did y--?
Safecracker|Fishbone. Did it yesterday. I was waitin' for a lull, to slip out. Witcher showed up afore I could.
Safecracker|Let that be my recommendation. Now, do tell, what's it you need me for?
Geralt|Need you to open something for me. Something bigger than a cage.
Safecracker|Sounds interestin'. Dyin' to hear the details.
Geralt|Herbalist's hut near Oxenfurt. Knock on the door, ask for yarrow extract.
Geralt|Need you to open something. Something bigger than a cage.
Safecracker|Sounds interestin'. Dyin' to hear the details.
Geralt|Herbalist's hut near Oxenfurt. Knock on the door, ask for yarrow extract.
Safecracker|Hm. Not sure I know where that is. Might you be goin' there? We could go together.
Geralt|All right, let's go. Stone's throw away.
Geralt|Not headed there just yet. Got something to tend to first. Meet you later. Head out of the city, ask for directions. Folk'll know the way.
Safecracker|Sound advice. See you.
Geralt|Tell you later. Got… got someone else I need to talk to.
Safecracker|I get that. When the time's ripe, look for me at the Academy gate. Come nightfall. Farewell.
Geralt|Buy him out? Pretty pedestrian. How about we play a round of cards for Quinto's freedom?
Redanian Officer 01|Hmm. Why not. But lose, and the price on his head'll double. You in?
Geralt|What the hell. I'm game.
Safecracker|Got my fingers crossed!
Geralt|No. Way too risky.
Redanian Officer 01|So pay up or piss off. No three ways about it.
Geralt|Mh, famous mercenary, supposedly, but you're acting like an old fishwife. Just counting the crowns, counting the crowns.
Redanian Officer 01|What? I'll not take any insults from some bloody mutant! I proved my mettle at Hagge, Dillingen, Brenna and--
Geralt|All long ago and probably only half true. You're bold, sure… with your mouth.
Safecracker|Ooo… That must've hurt, that.
Redanian Officer 01|What?! Those words! Bark 'em back, you bastard!
Geralt|Bare fists. Make me take it back. If you fail, you'll let Quinto go. Deal?
Redanian Officer 01|Bloody deal! Lads, give us some space. I need to show this drifter what happens when you cross Hans of Cidaris!
Geralt|Calm down, now. Helmet's liable to fall off. I take it back. Satisfied?
Redanian Officer 01|I advise you well! Do not rile me again! Now pay up or sod off!
Redanian Officer 01|Cheat me out o' coin, then dare insult me?! Take it back, you bastard! Open your gob and take it right back!
Geralt|Hm. I'll be back.
Redanian Officer 01|Where was I? Right. Want me to let him go? Pay up. But I've a special rate for you. You fleeced me, now it's my turn.
Safecracker|Just as I said, an enterprisin' individual.
Redanian Officer 01|And just as I said, clamp it shut! Stop interruptin'!
Geralt|What'd he do to step on your toes?
Redanian Officer 01|Ours? Not ours. But he's stuck sticks up a number of bankers' arses. Put a tidy price on his head, they did.
Safecracker|And as Master Hans of Cidaris is an enterprisin' individual, he decided to nab me and claim the reward.
Redanian Officer 01|Anyone give you leave to talk?! Shut your trap!
Redanian Officer 01|First you use threats to extort coin, and now you want to scheme with my prisoner? Not a chance!
Redanian Officer 01|You got to be mad!
Safecracker|Quite the reasonable offer, to my mind.
Redanian Officer 01|Your mouth!
Redanian Officer 01|Hm… don't know, don't know…
Safecracker|Whoa-hoh! An agreement's in sight!
Redanian Officer 01|All right. I'm willin' to take that.
Safecracker|A consensus was in sight from the start!
Redanian Officer 01|Slow down. Witcher hasn't paid yet.
Redanian Officer 01|No. I've no patience for your kind. Full price, and not a copper less!
Safecracker|Overdid it a bit, witcher. Even I'm willin' to admit that.
Redanian Officer 01|Aye! See? And you keep your mouth shut!
Redanian Officer 01|Hah! Beat your arse good! Heheheh!
Safecracker|Mhh, you should've passed, mate, should've passed.
Redanian Officer 01|The price of Quinto's freedom just went up! Twofold!
Geralt|Pass for me too. Let's total it up. I win.
Safecracker|Heavy-handed, Hans. The Tretogor maneuver - with cards like that?!
Redanian Officer 01|Ugh! Get him out of here, before I fuckin' burst a--
Redanian Officer 01|What now? Don't you understand Common? Stay away from the cage!
Redanian Officer 01|Well, willin' to pay? 'Cause I'm torn, don't know if I should send him to the gallows or wait.
Redanian Officer 01|So what'll it be? We got a deal or not?
Geralt|Thought you looked wimpy. Didn't expect it to be that easy, though.
Safecracker|Must admit I'm fairly surprised meself.
Redanian Officer 01|Your trap! Both of youse! Take him, witcher. And bugger you bo--
Redanian Officer 01|Hah! No man can match me! Not a fuckin' one! Come on now, witcher - say it!
Geralt|Ahem. No better fighter than Hans of Cidaris.
Redanian Officer 01|Exactly! Couldn't 'ave said it better meself! Now, Quinto - you can still buy the shit's freedom, but the price just went up. Twofold!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Mhm. Herbalist's hut near Oxenfurt. Go there, ask for yarrow extract. Can you remember that?
Safecracker|Hmm… I think I can. See you there soon.
Geralt|Yeah. Herbalist, has a hut near Oxenfurt. Go there, ask for yarrow extract.
Safecracker|I shall do just that. Hm. Wouldn't happen to be goin' there yourself, would you? We might go together.
Geralt|All right. Let's go. Just a stone's throw away.
Geralt|Not headed in that direction just yet. tam Meet you there later.
Geralt|Sorry. Can't say yet.
Safecracker|You're forgiven. Take your time, I shall await word.
Safecracker|Greetin's. How's it? Got some form of employ for me?
Safecracker|I've got to admit I've got itchy fingers, itchy fingers…
Safecracker|Chattin's a waste of time, Geralt. Let's get to work.
<|endoftext|>
Safecracker|And Countess Yvonne of Lan Exeter's necklace. Your handiwork, wasn't it?
Circus Artist|It was. I scaled a gutter, entered her bedchamber.
Safecracker|Hah! I knew it! I knew it.
Ewald Borsody|Ah, at last. We're all here. Time to begin.
Ewald Borsody|This heist, it's no jest. So if any of you has any doubts, isn't sure, now's the time to leave. Won't be able to after.
Ewald Borsody|The Borsodis' Auction House, its vault - that's our target. Eveline, you'll enter through the tower when the patrol rounds this corner. Drop us a line. We have to be inside within five minutes. Is that enough?
Circus Artist|It's plenty.
Ewald Borsody|Splendid. Once we're all in the tower, we'll proceed to the auction house. Shouldn't see any guards inside. If we do, we'll have Geralt and his blades.
Ewald Borsody|Then downstairs to the vault. Quinto will crack the lock. We get in the vault, take the loot, disappear out the back through a secret passage.
Ewald Borsody|I've said my piece. Any questions?
Geralt|All right. Let's get to work. Wanna be done with this soon as possible.
Ewald Borsody|We'll reconvene in the gateway beside the tower. Midnight sharp. And everyone's to make sure they're not followed. I'll get word to the cook in the barracks.
Safecracker|What about wearin' masks? Not a city in the North that don't have wanted posters with my likeness hangin' about.
Ewald Borsody|I'll tend to that.
Ewald Borsody|Ah, one last thing.
Ewald Borsody|Inform the City Watch, blabber anythin' about this over an ale, and I'll kill you. With me own hands.
Geralt|If you're so damned scared somebody'll talk, let's all go there together. Now.
Ewald Borsody|Any objections? Anyone need more time?
Ewald Borsody|On our way, then.
Geralt|Huh, sure know how to motivate a crew. No matter. See you there.
Ewald Borsody|Geralt, I see, has come prepared.
Circus Artist|Think it's a fetish of sorts?
Ewald Borsody|And I will bring masks for the rest.
Demolition Dwarf|What about masks? Got a rather recognizable mug myself.
Geralt|Hm. All good and fine, except… what if something goes wrong? Seriously.
Ewald Borsody|You're on your own. We all are.
Geralt|Just like that?
Circus Artist|No room for friendship in this business.
Geralt|Additional security measures, traps - any inside? Anything we need to watch out for?
Ewald Borsody|Nothing particularly dangerous. Here, on the ground floor, there's a rope linked to the bell in the tower. Anyone sounds the alarm, there'll be trouble.
Circus Artist|How do we stop it from ringing?
Ewald Borsody|Don't pull the rope. As I said, the auction house ought to be empty. I don't expect any problems.
Safecracker|What about the vault? How is it secured?
Ewald Borsody|With a door. But you ought to be able to handle it. Any other problems we resolve as they come.
Ewald Borsody|Anything else?
Circus Artist|And the vault? Is it secured somehow?
Demolition Dwarf|Even if it is, my blend of saltpeter, cordite and fulminatin' silver'll do the trick.
Geralt|Got a horse sense take on this. Secret passage - if we plan to use it on the way out, why not on the way in?
Circus Artist|Excellent question. Why not?
Ewald Borsody|Every corridor has two ends, right? Like a rope. I know the location of just one end. It's in the vault. The other, it's somewhere beneath the city. But I can't tell you where.
Geralt|Mhm. Great.
Safecracker|But if you were to--
Ewald Borsody|Find that location, I wouldn't need any of you. Believe you me, I've tried. Time and again.
Ewald Borsody|Anythin' else?
Demolition Dwarf|Aye, but you could--
Ewald Borsody|Then downstairs to the vault. Casimir blows the vault door. We go in, take the loot, disappear out the back through a secret passage.
Demolition Dwarf|…And might ye, miss, be 'midst the unattached? I am… though only a wee spell now.
Circus Artist|Is that so? Impossible! Only a fool would loosen their hold on a mate like you.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What do you have to say…?
Auction House Guard 03|Lance Corporal Vatslav - how'd that prick wind up with us?
Auction House Guard 05|Volunteered. Word is he had to bribe the medics to let him enlist.
Auction House Guard 03|He mad, or what?
Auction House Guard 05|That's just it - certifiably insane. Didn't pass the tests, apparently.
Auction House Guard 03|But to pay hard coin to enter the army… Thought at my age nothin' could surprise me.
Auction House Guard 04|That, uh, Horst Borsodi - he got a daughter?
Auction House Guard 02|Why do you ask?
Auction House Guard 04|Well, think on it. To marry into a dynasty like that. It'd be like livin' in clover!
Auction House Guard 02|Trust me, you'd do better not to take any interest in the Borsodis.
Auction House Guard 04|Why the hell not?
Auction House Guard 02|It can only bring trouble, mate, only trouble.
Auction House Guard 01|Mh, fish chowder for supper the day.
Auction House Guard 05|That true? Who told you?
Auction House Guard 01|No one. Came through the Western Gate the morn. Saw Maarten on the pier, rod in hand, fishin'.
Auction House Guard 05|Cook like that's a right treasure, he is. No gripin' about poor supplies. Just the gumption to enrich our gruel.
Auction House Guard 01|Mh, aye. If only he'd go a bit lighter on the garlic…
Geralt|Pier near the Western Gate. Should be easy enough to find.
Geralt|Hm. Need to brew the mixture first.
Geralt|Mhm. Must be the cook.
Geralt|Good day. Fish biting?
Redanian Townsman 04|Aye, they're biting.
Geralt|What about you?
Redanian Townsman 04|What's that?
Geralt|Got this mixture. Pay you to pour it in the soup for the boys at the garrison. On my signal. Nothing dangerous about it. Most they'll think is that the fish wasn't exactly fresh.
Redanian Townsman 04|It'll cost you, mate. Something dear.
Geralt|Fine. Here.
Geralt|Wait for the signal. And mum's the word, understood?
Geralt|Asking a lot. Too much. How about you do this free of charge, huh? Out of the kindness of your heart?
Redanian Townsman 04|Aye, I'll help. Outta kindness…
Geralt|Know what? Be back later.
Redanian Townsman 04|You're scarin' the fish away. Pay up or piss off.
Geralt|Hm, a few drops and the boys at the barracks'll have a restless night…
Redanian Townsman 04|Go on, now. We'd best not be seen together.
Geralt|Nothing about the cook...
Geralt|Hmm... Nothing interesting.
<|endoftext|>
Ewald Borsody|Well, well. Got an early bird in our midst.
Ewald Borsody|Prime. Just one patrol. Mixture of yours must've worked.
Ewald Borsody|Eveline. You ready?
Circus Artist|Are you kidding? Of course I am.
Ewald Borsody|Three… two… one.
Ewald Borsody|It's clear. On your way!
Auction House Guard 02|Ploughin' city fowl. Shite all over, again.
Circus Artist|Groo, grooo, groo!
Auction House Guard 02|What?! I'll show you--
Safecracker|Patrol's turnin' round!
Ewald Borsody|We've one minute! Move!
Safecracker|Hail Melitele, hallowed mother, keep us from…
Safecracker|If memory serves, you assured us there'd be no one inside.
Ewald Borsody|Seems my informer was wrong.
Circus Artist|Is that all you've got to say? I nearly broke my neck!
Ewald Borsody|You knew what you were signin' up for. This is no time to argue.
Geralt|Not the time, true. But we'll discuss this later. You can be sure of that.
Ewald Borsody|At your service, mate.
Ewald Borsody|One guard could mean many more. You'd best draw your sword now.
Geralt|No.
Ewald Borsody|What now?
Geralt|No one dies. Said so from the start.
Ewald Borsody|Whatever… Don your masks and let's go.
Circus Artist|{…}
Geralt|Gotta agree. Backing out's not an option anymore. Need to see this through, whatever happens.
Ewald Borsody|Hallowed words.
Ewald Borsody|It's clear. On your way!
Auction House Guard 02|Ploughin' city fowl. Shite all over, again.
Circus Artist|Groo, grooo, groo!
Auction House Guard 02|What?! I'll show you...
Demolition Dwarf|Patrol's turnin' round!
Ewald Borsody|We've one minute! Move!
Demolition Dwarf|Damn. Should've blown myself to bits, prick and all.
Demolition Dwarf|Bugger it all! Ye said there'd be no one inside!
Ewald Borsody|Let's begin.
Ewald Borsody|Careful, now. One guard could mean many more.
Ewald Borsody|Geralt, you lead. On your tiptoes, hand on your sword.
Demolition Dwarf|Don't fret, love. Ye're fetchin' no matter what ye wear!
Ewald Borsody|Shut it. And you, Eveline, no more foolishness. Come on.
Safecracker|Would you like a ball gown and tiara to go with that?
<|endoftext|>
Ewald Borsody|But we do have hostages.
Auction House Clerk 01|Mercy, master!
Negotiator|On the count of three, we go in! One! Two!
Auction House Clerk 01|Aaaarrrrrgh!
Ewald Borsody|Come one step closer and folk will die!
Negotiator|Hold, now! We must negotiate!
Negotiator|What're your demands? To release the hostages!
Ewald Borsody|Buy us a bit o' time, Geralt.
Geralt|We have one demand. Pull back from the auction house.
Ewald Borsody|…
Negotiator|You know I cannot do that!
Geralt|You can! Just not sure you want to. How about I help you decide, kill a hostage?
Auction House Clerk 01|Just do what they want! I beg you! Aaaargh!
Negotiator|Calm yourself! No one is to be harmed, clear?
Geralt|Nothing simpler! So long as you take your boys and pull out. We'll all live happily ever after.
Negotiator|I repeat - that is not an option! We must bargain, reach an agreement!
Geralt|See if I can't make this clear! We're not at a food market! No bargains to be made here! Lives are at stake!
Negotiator|I understand, I do, but--!
Geralt|No "buts!" Gonna count to three! Then heads will roll! One!
Auction House Clerk 01|Gods have mercy! Just do what he asks!
Negotiator|Y-you leave me no choice!
Geralt|Two!
Negotiator|Attaaaack!
Ewald Borsody|Oops. Tipped the scales.
Geralt|So tell me a joke! Any joke! So long as it's funny!
Negotiator|Excuse me?! This is no--!
Geralt|Got a tip for you! No charge! Every tip after this will cost you - in the blood of an innocent!
Geralt|When talking to someone who's holding hostages, never use the words "no," "not," "but," or "maybe!" Understand, Reginald?!
Negotiator|My name's not Reg--!
Auction House Clerk 01|Aaaaargh! You-- You're not supposed to say "not!"
Geralt|Huh, see that?! This one gets the idea! And if I want to call you Reginald, I'll call you Reginald! Clear?!
Negotiator|Y-yes! Clear!
Geralt|Excellent! So lemme hear the joke, Reginald! And believe me - you better hope it makes me laugh!
Negotiator|A l-little elflin' runs up to its m-mother callin', "Poop! Poop!" Sh-she says, "It's o-over there, love, c-cut yourself a slice!"
Geralt|Pathetic, Reginald! A joke that bad's a damn crime, you know?! And crimes demand punishment!
Negotiator|No, no! Wait!
Auction House Clerk 01|Aaaargh! You swiving idiot! You're not to say "NO!"
Negotiator|Damn it all. Enough! Attaaack!
Geralt|Heh. Actually kind of funny! Make that up yourself?!
Negotiator|No, I--!
Auction House Clerk 01|Aaargh! For the love of the gods, stop saying "NO!"
Negotiator|Yes! Yes! I made it up meself! All alone!
Geralt|Got talent, Reginald! Start thinking of your next joke! You got ten minutes.
Geralt|Good will gesture, now! Letting one hostage go! Then another hostage for every joke you tell me! Deal?!
Negotiator|Deal! Ten minutes!
Ewald Borsody|Ugh. Good work.
Circus Artist|Sorry, boys. You'll have to go on without me. I didn't sign on for this turn of events.
Ewald Borsody|Just one way out of here. Through the vault.
Circus Artist|There's a second - the chimney. Believe I'll squeeze through.
Ewald Borsody|Doubt you can, witcher. You've no choice, I'm afraid. Let's go. Downstairs.
Geralt|You a racist, Reginald?!
Negotiator|No! Not at all. I just--!
Auction House Clerk 01|Aaaaargh! Don't say "NO!"
Negotiator|Yes! Yes! I'm a racist! I bloody hate elves! Dwarves too!
Geralt|Give you another chance, Reginald! You got ten minutes to think of a better joke! Don't fuck this up!
Geralt|So we want a wagon. And horses.
Negotiator|It's the middle of the night! Where am I to find a wagon?!
Geralt|Rather go looking for caskets?
Auction House Clerk 01|Aaaargh! He means it!
Negotiator|Good point! A wagon, then! What kind?!
Geralt|Radovid's coronation carriage! Nothing less! Drawn by two snow-white mares!
Negotiator|Do you think this situation a jest?!
Geralt|Do you?!
Auction House Clerk 01|Aaaargh! No! You're both right! This is no jest!
Negotiator|I want us to reach an agreement! I don't want anyone to get hurt! But you must not ask the impossible!
Geralt|Second time you're turning me down. Shit negotiation tactic.
Negotiator|It seems negotiation's not my strong suit! Nor is it yours! Attaaack!
Geralt|We're not picky. Any old cart. Long as it has wheels that roll.
Negotiator|All right. I'll get it done! In exchange, you must release the hostages!
Geralt|How many?!
Negotiator|All of them!
Geralt|Take me for a fool? No chance.
Negotiator|You've got to understand. Safety of the hostages is my primary concern.
Geralt|No, you have to understand! One's got a knife to his neck! A sharp knife!
Negotiator|I was willin' to meet you half way! Instead, I hear threats!
Negotiator|Bloodshed - is that what you want? Have it your way. Attaaaack!
Geralt|You know I can't do that! Here's a compromise - one hostage now, the rest once the wagon arrives!
Negotiator|So be it! Agreed!
Auction House Clerk 01|Thanks be to Melitele!
Geralt|But anything smells fishy, or you dawdle even a bit, heads will roll, understand?!
Negotiator|Calm, now! You'll hear horses neighin' before a quarter hour's out! Matko! Chedrew! City stables! On the double!
Geralt|Prepared to let us walk away peacefully?!
Negotiator|Officer's word!
Geralt|All right! So be it! Let them go.
Ewald Borsody|A right shite idea.
Geralt|I know what I'm doing. Open the damn door.
Negotiator|An honorable deed! And a stupid one. Attaaaack!
Demolition Dwarf|…
Geralt|Not about to hide behind these folk. I'm letting them go.
Ewald Borsody|Are you mad? Any idea what'll happen?
Geralt|Yes. And you have any idea what'll happen if you try to stop me? Out of my way. Now!
Negotiator|An honorable deed. The court's sure to consider it a mitigatin' factor. Now, you've one minute to come out. One at a time. Hands on your heads!
Circus Artist|I'm going. Up the chimney and out. It's grown too hot, pure and simple. Best of luck, gentlemen.
Safecracker|Drink to our health, once you're far away.
Negotiator|You had your chance! Attaaack!
Ewald Borsody|Still insist on usin' that wooden sword?
Ewald Borsody|Get to work, Quinto. We'll try and hold off the assault.
Ewald Borsody|Get to work, Casimir. We'll try and hold off the assault.
Demolition Dwarf|I'd gladly go with ye, miss. But I'm afeared I'm a wee bit too bulky. 'Twas a pleasure.
Safecracker|Time you took a gander downstairs. Vault's open.
Ewald Borsody|Bravo. Splendid job you did there.
Geralt|I'm a witcher. Not your negotiator.
Geralt|Where's Eveline?
Ewald Borsody|She's fled. All the better. Fewer hands reachin' out for loot. Come on, before reinforcements arrive.
Geralt|Dammit. Explosion triggered that fight. Could've done without both.
Ewald Borsody|That explosion gets us in the vault.
Ewald Borsody|So? Satisfied? Conscience still clear?
Geralt|Follow my own rules. Couldn't give shit if you approve.
Ewald Borsody|Right. Our paths will diverge soon enough.
Ewald Borsody|In the meantime, the vault awaits. Ought to be open by now.
Circus Artist|Haaa-ya!
Ewald Borsody|Stop him! He's not to flee!
Geralt|Locked themselves in!
Ewald Borsody|Bollocks!
Geralt|Dammit.
Negotiator|Lay down your arms! You have no chance!
Ewald Borsody|Perhaps not.
Geralt|No fear they'll send more soldiers in?
Ewald Borsody|If your concoction's worth anythin', most're standin' in line to the latrines. Buys us a bit of time, that.
<|endoftext|>
Horst Borsody|You don't know who you're fucking with!
Ewald Borsody|On the contrary. I know all too well.
Ewald Borsody|…
Horst Borsody|E-Ewald?!
Ewald Borsody|Greetings, brother. Been years.
Safecracker|Well, well. Complications, complications…
Geralt|Right. Should've known. Same eyes, same double chin, same rotten heart.
Geralt|Just one question. This family reunion - what's the point?
Ewald Borsody|Revenge. For betrayal. Years of poverty, humiliation.
Ewald Borsody|Father left the auction house to me in his will. Horst cheated me. Had me disinherited.
Horst Borsody|Anything, everything we earned you squandered on cards and whores! Father didn't see that! I did!
Ewald Borsody|That's no excuse, Horst. And it won't save your life.
Horst Borsody|You two! Stand with me! I'll not let the Redanians lay a hand on you! Give you whatever you want!
Geralt|Generous offer, Horst. Believe I'll take it.
Ewald Borsody|What?! How dare you?!
Geralt|Hate to be taken for a ride - said that from the start. Should've treated it seriously.
Safecracker|Well, hard not to agree with that. Sorry, Ewald.
Horst Borsody|You see? All have turned against you. Once again. This time for the last time.
Ewald Borsody|Yet to be seen. I'll not go quietly.
Geralt|Ugh… Of two evils, guess I prefer you, Horst.
Geralt|A desperate attempt at bribery. Going once, twice, thrice… Hm, no takers, no sale.
Safecracker|Speak for yourself. Temptin' offer. I've succumbed.
Ewald Borsody|You'll pay for that, Quinto. With your head. At them!
Demolition Dwarf|Aw, we'll take whatever we please. Once we've ripped your runners from yer arse.
Ewald Borsody|Hallowed words, mate. At 'em!
Geralt|If that's your attitude, I'll stand with Ewald.
Geralt|Not about to meddle, especially not in family matters.
Horst Borsody|Then you'd have done better not to break into my vault.
Horst Borsody|I fear it's too late to turn neutral. Stand with me, and I shall drape you in gold. Stand against me, and you'll remain here forever.
Geralt|Think you owe us an explanation… Ewald Borsodi. This family reunion - what's the point?
Demolition Dwarf|Stone me stupid and slap me happy.
<|endoftext|>
Horst Borsody|Look. Even your accomplices have turned against you.
Horst Borsody|But not I. A brother once, a brother always. I'm prepared to forgive you.
Ewald Borsody|Is that so?
Horst Borsody|On one condition - that you acknowledge me as head of the family. And bow before me.
Horst Borsody|I might've fallen prey… had I not known you.
Horst Borsody|But I do, Ewald. The bad shilling that always turns up.
Horst Borsody|Bathe and dress him for the funeral. Something presentable - I'll not have him bring me more shame.
Ewald Borsody|I'd have preferred to resolve this elsewise. Stolen the scrolls, thrown you out into the street. Revenge is best served cold, after all.
Ewald Borsody|But I don't mind servin' it hot. No.
Horst Borsody|I beg you. Mercy! For your brother! I shall do anything you ask!
Ewald Borsody|Truly? Anythin'?
Horst Borsody|Anything!
Ewald Borsody|Sign over to me all that you own. Then walk out as you stand, with just the clothin' on your back.
Horst Borsody|Allow me one thing. Any one thing!
Ewald Borsody|Fifteen years! In the sewers! Beggin'! Like a beast! And you've the cheek… to plead?!
Ewald Borsody|Take that.
Ewald Borsody|I'd have preferred to resolve this elsewise. Stolen the scrolls, thrown you out into the street. Revenge is best served cold, after all.
Ewald Borsody|But I don't mind servin' it hot. No.
Horst Borsody|I beg you. Mercy! For your brother! I shall do anything you ask!
Ewald Borsody|Truly? Anythin'?
Horst Borsody|Anything!
Ewald Borsody|Sign over to me all that you own. Then walk out as you stand, with just the clothing on your back.
Horst Borsody|Allow me one thing. Any one thing!
Ewald Borsody|Fifteen years! In the sewers! Beggin'! Like a beast! And you've the cheek… to plead?!
Ewald Borsody|Take that.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Satisfied?
Ewald Borsody|Exceptionally! You?
Geralt|No. And I won't be until I find Max Borsodi's House. In this vault - or so you said.
Ewald Borsody|And it is. There. But, I fear it's not yours for the takin'.
Ewald Borsody|You see, it houses my father's will. A scroll thanks to which Ewald Borsodi, long missing, will assume the family fortune.
Geralt|And Geralt of Rivia, who you cheated, what'll he assume?
Ewald Borsody|Alas. But he's free to choose anything else.
Geralt|Don't provoke me. Never know, might choose to take your head.
Ewald Borsody|You're wounded, tired. Figure my chances are good.
Geralt|Hmm, dumb. But have it your way. Let's make this quick, before the soldiers get down here.
Ewald Borsody|At your service, mate.
Ewald Borsody|Casimir, stand with me. I'll make you my treasurer, your salary in the thousands, mate.
Demolition Dwarf|Sorry, Geralt. But coin's coin, no two ways about it.
Ewald Borsody|As I said, at your service, mate.
Geralt|I could drop you easily. But maybe I don't have to. We could try to figure this out.
Ewald Borsody|A compromise looks unlikely. We both want Max's House.
Geralt|Not quite. You just need the contents. Me - the box.
Redanian Soldier 01|They're downstairs!
Ewald Borsody|So be it. Seal it with a handshake.
Geralt|Give me the damn casket, and let's get out of here.
Ewald Borsody|As you wish. This way.
Demolition Dwarf|Oooph. That's a load off my prick!
Geralt|You tricked me.
Ewald Borsody|And you were prepared to let me face Horst's thugs alone. To my mind, we're even.
Ewald Borsody|Now Max Borsodi's House - if you've absolutely got to have it, you'll need to take it from me by force.
Demolition Dwarf|Gents. Gents - keep calm!
<|endoftext|>
Horst Borsody|At last. How I despise unfinished business.
Geralt|Whaddaya say we talk about my reward?
Horst Borsody|Yes, well, as I said, you're free to take what you please.
Safecracker|Think I'll give this ruby necklace a new home…
Geralt|And as I said…
Horst Borsody|Of course. The witcher.
Geralt|I want Max Borsodi's House. Whatever it is.
Horst Borsody|You fail to understand. Scrolls, documents, the will in there - none of this can land in strange hands. Not for any price.
Geralt|Any? You sure?
Safecracker|Gents, might I appeal to your sense of reason?
Horst Borsody|Yes, witcher. I'd sooner die than let you have those papers.
Geralt|Be happy to help you join your brother.
Horst Borsody|You! Stand with me. Security consultant, the position's yours. With a salary in the thousands.
Safecracker|Lucrative offer. I like lucrative offers.
Geralt|Two betryals in a row. Not an ounce of honor.
Safecracker|What can I say? I am a thief.
Horst Borsody|Kill the witcher!
Geralt|Admire your courage, I do, but we need to figure something out.
Horst Borsody|How? I was clear - I'll not hand you the House!
Geralt|No. Said you won't hand me its contents. I don't need those papers. Casket'll do me just fine.
Horst Borsody|I see. The wolf leaves sated, yet the sheep lives on.
Geralt|This wolf's pretty damn tired. So lemme have the damn casket and lead us out of here.
Horst Borsody|With immense pleasure. Believe me.
Horst Borsody|Whereas you I like. Wait with me a while. We must talk. I seek someone excpetionally well versed in locks and traps and whatnot.
Safecracker|Why, work of that sort would be a right honor, guv'nor.
Horst Borsody|This way. Get out, witcher. And don't come back.
Horst Borsody|You fail to understand. Scrolls, documents, the will in there - none of this can land in Olgierd's hands. Not for any price.
Horst Borsody|As I said - take whatever you please.
<|endoftext|>
Ewald Borsody|Well, here's where our Paths part.
Geralt|Shut up.
Ewald Borsody|Was I that bad?
Geralt|No. But you came awfully close, Ewald. Survived by a hair.
Geralt|Take care, Casimir. Here's hoping Euphemia sees the light, comes back.
Demolition Dwarf|Och, plough her moods and ires. With the gold I've got, "love" just ain't nothin' I need.
Geralt|Heheh. In that case, you and your coin purse live happily ever after.
Ewald Borsody|You ever have a basilisk hide or fiend horns and want a good price? Look for me at the auction house!
Geralt|Mhm. Consider it noted.
<|endoftext|>
Olgierd|Ah, that's better. Do you smoke?
Geralt|No. Supposed to be bad for you.
Olgierd|Hah. You see? An advantage of being immortal.
Olgierd|So, what have you brought me?
Olgierd|Ah, Horst must be livid.
Geralt|He's not.
Olgierd|No?
Geralt|He's not anything, except dead. His brother - same thing. A few others too.
Olgierd|Stones you've got. But I didn't think you'd have the stomach for a massacre.
Geralt|Situation got out of hand.
Olgierd|Hah! Oh, sounds familiar. There you are, drinking, puffing on henbane… and then - Surprise! - heads rolling across the floor. And none know how or why!
Geralt|I'm not amused.
Olgierd|No? Why not?
Geralt|Cause unlike you, killing gives me no pleasure.
Olgierd|The Borsodis aren't worth your tears. Sons of bitches, to a man.
Geralt|The Borsodis - what's your gripe? Get kicked out of an auction?
Olgierd|Worse. They evicted me from my home.
Olgierd|Are you really interested?
Geralt|Wouldn't have asked if I wasn't.
Olgierd|Hah! Cheeky as ever.
Olgierd|My family, they took on some debt. A poor investment in a sawmill, a bad crop one year, a lawsuit lost. You know how it is - when it rains, it pours.
Olgierd|We needed but a few weeks to recover, but Horst Borsodi had acquired our debt. All of it. Demanded it be repaid immediately.
Olgierd|I pleaded, I begged, I tore open my shirt at his threshold. Agh, it was like talking to a wall.
Olgierd|I went to the auction. Saw those perfumed pricks buy my father's sword, my mother's death mask, my brother's horse tack. Ah, Horst earned a pretty pile selling our mementos.
Geralt|No surprise the animosity you feel for him.
Olgierd|That was but the start. My Iris' parents learned of my family's misfortune, and our betrothal was no more. They found her another suitor. One from beyond the sea.
Olgierd|The anger I felt, I thought I'd go mad. Went to the tavern. Drank a round, a second… I brawled, then had another tankard. And then… then, I asked the wrong bloke for help.
Geralt|What happened then?
Olgierd|Argh, what happened then, witcher, was one big stinkin' pile of shite.
Olgierd|You need something?
Geralt|Nothing more, don't think. I'm off to entertain your brother.
Olgierd|Break a leg. Literally.
Olgierd|Well? Why do you stand there? Do you need something still?
Olgierd|Well? Why do you stand there? Do you need something still?
Geralt|Sad story.
Olgierd|Isn't it? Truthfully, I'm surprised I retained any cheer in my soul.
Geralt|Summing up, you went broke, your woman dumped you, then you got drunk and did something stupid. Heard it all before.
Olgierd|Hahaha! And folk say I've a heart of stone…
Geralt|All in all, not really. Just asking out of courtesy.
Olgierd|Mhm. Commendable manners.
Geralt|Why did you need those papers?
Olgierd|Horst and Ewald are gnawing on soil now. But thanks to these papers, their relatives won't get the auction house. Family's lost it for good. And the hospital will have the funds it needs to treat orphans and beggars pro bono.
Geralt|Oh, think I might find the stomach for another. Once your final wish is fulfilled.
Olgierd|Hah. You really don't like me, do you?
Geralt|Hate smartasses, hate it when they try to use me. It's why both brothers are dead. And why you should tread carefully.
Olgierd|Noted. Now I've some advice for you.
Olgierd|The papers - where are they?
Geralt|Left them in the vault. You wanted the House, you got the House. Never mentioned its contents.
Olgierd|You're a quick study. Already as tricky as O'Dimm himself. Keen to ridicule a man.
Olgierd|Do you know what I and the company do with your type?
Geralt|Dunno. Ask for legal advice? Looks to me like you might need some.
Geralt|You signed the contract, Olgierd. I'm just fulfilling its terms. To the letter. Unhappy? Hell, should've chosen your words more carefully.
Olgierd|Yes. I should have.
Olgierd|I assume you came to an agreement with Horst. Shame. A right whoreson, that one.
Geralt|His brother Ewald was worse.
Olgierd|Was?
Geralt|Horst killed him. With his own hands.
Olgierd|Huh. It's progress.
Geralt|Why'd you even need those papers?
Olgierd|Aimed to deliver those papers to the right hands. Borsodi would've landed in the streets. And the hospital would've gotten the funds it needs to treat orphans and beggars pro bono.
Geralt|Made a deal with his brother. Who then beat the living shit out of Horst with a gold candle holder.
Geralt|No, dying to hear, though. Always liked a tale with a thrill.
Olgierd|I'm in no mood for jests.
Geralt|Neither am I. Did my job, Olgierd. Delivered what you asked for. To the letter. Unhappy? Hell, should've chosen your words more carefully.
Olgierd|A moment. I need to smoke.
Olgierd|So, what have you brought me?
Olgierd|Ah, that's better. All right, what do you have for me?
Geralt|Max Borsodi's House. As requested.
Olgierd|To sink the Borsodis, naturally.
Olgierd|You see, I learned of an interesting clause in old man Maximilian's will.
Olgierd|It states that his sons must meet and shake hands in agreement at least once a year at Belleteyn. Failing that, the auction house must be auctioned off. The proceeds to go to Vilmerius Hospital.
Geralt|Guess the old man sensed what might happen.
Geralt|Awfully noble of you, showing so much concern for the needy.
Olgierd|I couldn't give a rat's arse about the needy. May they wither and disappear along with the city.
Olgierd|I wanted one thing. Revenge.
Geralt|Horst's brother - did you know about him?
Olgierd|I should think so. Ewald was famous in certain circles.
Geralt|Which ones?
Olgierd|The kind noble witchers don't usually associate with.
Olgierd|He murdered for coin. No questions. Without batting an eye. Always extravagantly, though. If not for his damned surname, I believe I'd have invited him to join the company.
<|endoftext|>
Redanian Townsman 03|Have you heard? Auction house is under new management.
Redanian Townsman 04|The sign still says "Borsodi."
Redanian Townsman 03|Aye, but a different one. Ewald.
Redanian Townsman 04|What of Horst? Any news?
Redanian Townsman 03|Folk say it were a ticker tantrum. But the casket were closed for the burial. So, you know…
Redanian Townsman 03|There a break-in at the auction house? That true?
Redanian Townsman 04|Horst claims no such thing occurred. That it were a security exercise.
Redanian Townsman 03|An exercise? With them carting corpses away after?
Redanian Townsman 04|I don't honestly know. And I don't aim to ask.
Redanian Townsman 03|Horst Borsodi's funeral yesterday.
Redanian Townsman 04|Aye, and?
Redanian Townsman 03|No one came.
Redanian Townsman 04|Did he have no kin?
Redanian Townsman 03|He had some, but there's a grim story to it all. Anyroad, Vivaldi's taken over the auction house.
Geralt|Vivaldi? Little weasel. Must've been a bargain he couldn't pass up.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Redanians'll be here soon. Dammit, secret passage - where is it?
Geralt|Huh. Air seeping through the cracks. Passage must be here. Now how do I open it?
Geralt|Nick of time. Now to get out of here.
Geralt|Sewers? Should've known.
Geralt|Hmm. Some spilled wine. Nothing else.
Geralt|Beautiful. But first blow would shatter them.
Geralt|Hm, this one probably also belonged to a sorceress… Fetish, maybe?
Geralt|From the collection of the mage Aeramas…
Geralt|Codex Redaniensis… Sole surviving copy.
Geralt|Hm. A giant's. Or maybe a jotun's.
Geralt|"Goblet of Fire." Wonder what it is…
Geralt|Lovely sculpture. Probably end up adorning somebody's garden.
Geralt|Zerrikanian spears. "Excellent adornments for any parlor wall." Heheh. Good to know.
Geralt|Letters must be old… String seems to say so, too.
Geralt|It was true love…
Geralt|Same paintings were on the block…
Geralt|Including this fine piece by van der Knoob, the master from Maribor.
Geralt|No buyers, I guess. Not really surprised.
Geralt|Guess this is where they store whatever doesn't sell.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Fulfilled two of your wishes. Time I learned the third.
Olgierd|Confident, aren't you? Proud, sure of your strengths, fearless…
Geralt|Third task. If you don't mind.
Olgierd|Mutations - they stripped you of emotion. Tell me, have you ever loved? I mean truly loved?
Geralt|In no mood for a heart-to-heart. I'm to do something for you. Tell me what it is.
Olgierd|A true professional, eh? Know what I think? I think you only feign the cold killer, when in fact you seek new and ever stronger sensations - as I do. Seek to prove to yourself that you're are still able to feel, that some remnant of humanity remains within you.
Olgierd|I'd make a right good witcher. Problem is, I don't know the road to Kaer Morhen, and I doubt you'd give me a pendant.
Geralt|Cut the shit, Olgierd.
Geralt|Third wish - still waiting to hear it.
Olgierd|My, aren't you stubborn. Fine, listen well. I had a wife once. The day I saw her last, I gave her a rose, a violet one.
Olgierd|Bring me that bloom. Wouldn't mind remindin' myself what it looks like.
Geralt|Mhhh, when was that? How long's it been? Flower's wilted and turned to dust by now.
Olgierd|You wished to hear a wish - now you have. Fulfill it. I ride now to visit this Dauntless, but one of my men'll remain here. He'll know how to find me. That is, of course, should you succeed.
Geralt|Least you could tell me where your wife is.
Olgierd|In my old manor, east of Martin Feuille's farmstead. I'd wish you gods speed, but - well, you understand, I'm sure. Goodbye, Geralt.
Geralt|Yeah. I've loved. Can we get to the matter at hand?
Olgierd|Perhaps instead we ought to sit down inside, have a good chat over some fiery water?
Geralt|Not about to drink with you.
Geralt|We'll drink once the job's done.
Olgierd|Afraid that's impossible. Succeed, and that's the end of me. Fail, and you'll not be back.
Geralt|No. Haven't loved. Now let's get to the point.
Olgierd|You're lying - I can tell. Come, now, let's go inside, discuss this over some fiery water?
Geralt|You don't give a shit, Olgierd.
Olgierd|You'd make piss poor company for a talk about love, anyway.
Geralt|Barrel - what was that about?
Olgierd|On the way here we stopped for nourishment at a tavern belonging to one Lord Dauntless. We enjoyed ourselves as one does at an inn - raucously.
Olgierd|Our antics were not to the liking of this Dauntless. Sent a man to warn us that if we were ever to return, we would hang.
Geralt|You burn the inn down?
Olgierd|I left ample compensation with the innkeep. But it seems the rapscallion neglected to mention this to his lord.
Olgierd|But that's of little import. What matters is someone called me a whoreson and threatened to kill me.
Olgierd|It was one of those threats that sound like an invitation. I intend to accept it, return to those parts.
Geralt|Must've made quite a few enemies along the way. Maybe not today and not tomorrow, but someday, someone'll find a way to take you down.
Olgierd|And that should trouble me why? I feel no fear, no regret…
Olgierd|The wise men of Oxenfurt claim there are no gods. After death, there is only the void.
Olgierd|I've known this void already. Death holds no surprises.
Olgierd|The Ofieri believe one should only discuss important matters out of doors, with the gods as witnesses.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Graves… unmarked. Laid out in rows, like garden beds.
Geralt|Hey!
Geralt|Hear me?
Geralt|Other thief. Body's mutilated.
Geralt|Who are you?
Geralt|Damn!
Caretaker|Graaaah!
Caretaker|Grrr!
Caretaker|Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!
Caretaker|Hhhhhhsss…
Caretaker|Argh!
Caretaker|Arrrggh!
Geralt|So, how should I address you?
Demon Cat|As you did now. We'd rather keep our names to ourselves.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|This place seems suitable…
Demon Dog|Yes. She loved to paint.
Geralt|Did Iris von Everec have any last requests? Say how she wanted her remains disposed of?
Demon Cat|She feared death. Worried none would see to her burial or say a kind word in parting.
Geralt|Guess I'll be the one to do that.
Geralt|I didn't know Iris von Everec, so I can't say much about her.
Geralt|Fate had it a stranger now lays her remains in the grave.
Geralt|At times fate muddles our path, and life turns toilsome, hard to bear.
Geralt|Yet all deserve respite and peace in death.
Geralt|The remains are interred. Let's summon her.
Geralt|Tormented spirit! I've laid your bones to rest! Forget your wrath, forget your grief! Show yourself!
Geralt|Forgive me for tearing you from your realm. I need to ask you…
Geralt|Should I follow you? All right.
Geralt|Your name's inscribed in this sketchbook.
Geralt|Perhaps you'd like it to be buried with you.
Geralt|I don't know if you want to be buried with a painting of your husband.
Geralt|But you lived together, so maybe you want to be with him in death as well.
Geralt|I can't be sure this brush was yours.
Geralt|But if you liked pretty trinkets, you might not mind this one lying at your side.
Geralt|You two - got any last words for your mistress?
Demon Dog|We don't partake in human rituals.
Demon Cat|Trusting that what you've done is in keeping with your customs.
Geralt|Can't say much about Iris von Everec. But I do know I like her paintings.
Geralt|It's a shame her art couldn't bring her greater comfort.
Geralt|I didn't know Iris von Everec, but the paintings here show amply that she and Olgierd were a loving couple.
Geralt|Iris must've been happy, once.
Geralt|What the fuck was that?
Geralt|No eyes or nostrils, deformed organs… Damn thing had no right to be alive.
Demon Cat|Well… philosophers do still debate what it means to be "alive," exactly.
Geralt|Normally, I'd be shocked, but… not after what I just saw. Who are you two?
Demon Cat|Clearly not animals. Think of us as… friends of the house.
Geralt|You know the master of the house, the owner?
Demon Cat|Olgierd von Everec? Yes, we know him. But he left, and his wife became mistress of the house.
Geralt|Great. So, Lady von Everec home? Could you announce me, say she has a guest?
Demon Dog|Why do you wish to see her?
Geralt|I'm here to get the violet rose Olgierd gave Iris just before he left.
Demon Cat|Iris is inside. In the bedchamber upstairs. Take his key… it opens the rear door.
Geralt|Guess I'll make my own introductions.
Geralt|What's with the show? The pretense that you're animals. You couldn't have warned me?
Demon Cat|No. We're obliged to maintain discretion.
Geralt|So why talk to me at all?
Demon Cat|Why…? Well, we get so few chances to talk to humans. And we're curious to know what brought you.
Geralt|Gonna need a better answer than that.
Demon Dog|Later.
Geralt|What about this thing? What can you tell me? Friend of yours?
Demon Dog|We called him the Caretaker.
Geralt|Doesn't look like any creature I've ever seen. Where'd it come from?
Demon Cat|From very far away. He was summoned to guard Lady Iris and the home. He tended the garden, took care of unwanted guests.
Geralt|"Very far away" - meaning where, exactly?
Demon Dog|The name of this place would mean naught to you.
Geralt|Seems I gotta speak to Iris' ghost.
Demon Cat|It's no easy task to contact the mistress. Rage and bitterness fill her.
Geralt|Got my ways. To make contact with Iris, I gotta bury her body. But that Caretaker's macabre little cemetery won't do. Too much blood, too much fear.
Demon Cat|She spent much time in the front garden…
Geralt|Hm. Maybe there.
Demon Dog|Wait. Take this key. It opens the front door.
Geralt|Good dog.
Geralt|Her ghost's restless, angry. Attacks intruders. Know why?
Demon Cat|Lady von Everec has endured much hardship. She's unaccustomed to guests and not fond of strange folk.
Demon Dog|She can't hear us.
Geralt|How did she die? Don't see any wounds, evidence of a fight.
Demon Dog|Her heart burst.
Geralt|Meaning what? A heart attack?
Demon Dog|No. It simply burst.
Geralt|Find that hard to believe.
Demon Cat|Yet that's precisely what happened. One day Iris locked the front door, lay down here and… died. From grief, from loneliness.
Geralt|The deeper I get into this, the more I gotta wonder… why're you even helping me?
Demon Cat|We were summoned to serve Iris von Everec. Our mistress died, but that did not free us from her service.
Geralt|Got it. You wanna leave this place… leave these bodies.
Demon Dog|Surprised?
Geralt|No. Not at all.
Demon Cat|She liked to sit here. But this is not a good place for a grave.
Demon Dog|Too close to the house.
Geralt|I'll keep searching.
Geralt|Bedchamber… Iris was supposed to be here…
Geralt|Gotta be her… Dammit.
Demon Dog|You wished to see her - here she is.
Demon Cat|A man should frame his wishes carefully. It forestalls disappointment.
Geralt|This some sick joke? Why didn't you tell me she was dead right away?
Demon Dog|You didn't ask.
Geralt|Ugh… And why hasn't anyone buried her?
Demon Dog|We can't. As for the Caretaker, the one you cut down, while still alive she ordered him to stay away from her for all time.
Demon Dog|Iris von Everec adored flowers.
Demon Cat|But she would never want to destroy them.
Geralt|Hm, all right. I'll dig the grave somewhere else.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What is this place?
Demon Dog|The Painted World. The work of Iris von Everec.
Geralt|How'd you two get in here?
Demon Cat|We exist in both worlds at once.
Geralt|All right. This is lovely and all, but… where's Iris?
Demon Cat|You awoke her but for a moment. If you wish to speak to her, you must tear her from her slumber completely.
Geralt|Sure, but how?
Demon Dog|You're a tracker, right? Saw you examinin' the tracks outside.
Geralt|Yeah, so?
Demon Cat|This is a world built of memories blurred and wilting. Moments our mistress wishes to forget, but cannot.
Demon Dog|You need to find them, restore them. Summon the fears that torment Iris and destroy them.
Geralt|Easy to say…
Geralt|Strange place…
Demon Dog|One born of Iris von Everec's dreams.
Demon Cat|It existed only in her mind while she lived. In death, it gained substance.
Geralt|Pretty fantastic tale. Hard as hell to believe.
Demon Cat|Yet you'd best believe it - and be on your guard. The Painted World is rife with danger.
Geralt|…
Geralt|…
<|endoftext|>
Olgierd|Your health, my dear wife.
Iris|And yours, my husband.
Olgierd|In my land, custom calls that newlyweds be greeted with bread and salt. But we're alone for now.
Iris|I need none but you. Ah, if only this moment could last forever.
Olgierd|I shall see what I can do. But come in and see our home.
Iris|Gladly, but… I know this sounds silly… yet the house has sat empty for so long, and I'm…
Olgierd|Afraid of spiders, I know, I know. I swept them all up and tossed them in the garden.
Iris|My knight… you've seen to everything.
Geralt|Tattered decorations for a special occasion.
Geralt|Same figure.
Demon Dog|You'll see more of them.
Geralt|Hm? Medallion's humming…
Geralt|A wraith…?
Demon Dog|No. A nightmare.
Demon Cat|A fear crystallized. One you must now face.
Geralt|Wine cup. Just like the one Olgierd's holding.
Geralt|Olgierd and his wife? Look frozen mid-motion.
Demon Dog|One of her memories.
Demon Cat|It is blurred, incomplete. You must restore it.
Demon Dog|The memory's blurred.
Demon Cat|You must search for a way to restore it, complete it.
Geralt|A wedding veil?
Geralt|Ah, dammit all.
<|endoftext|>
Iris|We should get a dog… Or a dog and a cat - even better.
Iris|When the rain comes, the dog will warm my feet, and the cat will play with a ball of yarn by the fire. What do you think?
Iris|Are you even listening?
Olgierd|Apologies, dear. Had my mind on my book.
Iris|Is it that terribly absorbing?
Olgierd|Hm? Yes, terribly. Know what? Let's go inside.
Iris|Why? It's lovely out here. The birds singing, the bees buzzing… Blissful, really.
Olgierd|Sorry, dear… I feel unwell. I'll go in, you stay a while longer.
Geralt|That specter again.
Demon Cat|One of the mistress' fears incarnate.
Geralt|What is that…?
Geralt|Another memory?
Demon Dog|No. A nightmare.
Demon Cat|A fear embodied, which sooner or later you will have to confront.
Geralt|"The Spirit from the Steppe." Read often, well worn.
Geralt|Iris was painting the manor.
Geralt|Specters of Olgierd and his wife? But why aren't they moving?
Demon Dog|This is a memory.
Demon Cat|But it's incomplete, blurred. You must peer closely and restore it.
Geralt|Painting palette.
Geralt|Think this goes here…
Geralt|Pieces of tableware. For an afternoon tea… or breakfast.
Geralt|Shit, bees!
<|endoftext|>
Iris|Smile a bit wider.
Olgierd|Like this?
Iris|You were meant to smile, not bare your teeth.
Iris|No, still wrong. Smile like you did when Papa agreed we could marry. Please?
Olgierd|Hm?
Iris|You're useless. I can tell something's bothering you.
Olgierd|I've a bit of work I should see to.
Iris|Again? Olgierd… we agreed not to keep any secrets from one another. We promised.
Olgierd|Forgive me. I don't wish to discuss this.
Iris|Olgierd…
Iris|Olgierd!
Geralt|A portrait of the married couple.
Geralt|Hm. Pretty in the summer, the von Everecs' manor.
Geralt|Home-made paints. Strange… can still smell the turpentine.
Geralt|Another blurred memory.
Geralt|Living tableau's gotta look just like the painting…
Geralt|Let's try this…
Geralt|Hmm…
Geralt|This goes here…
Geralt|Finally. Just like the picture.
Geralt|Fits, I think…
Geralt|Maybe here?
Geralt|Let's try this…
Geralt|Maybe this…?
Geralt|Maybe on this side…
Geralt|Here?
Geralt|Fresh… as if someone just rinsed it.
Geralt|Hm. Still not right…
Geralt|She painted Olgierd… but the details are off. Living tableau's missing something…
Geralt|Dammit… Gotta go around.
Geralt|Goblet - like the one in the painting.
Geralt|Towel should hang here.
Geralt|Towel should lie here.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Rich Woman 02|My darling… is everything all right? You seem pale… out of sorts.
Iris|Everything's fine, really. But why don't you tell me how you fare? I'm ever so happy to see you! Except, why didn't Grandmamma and Grandpapa come?
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|It's a long, rugged journey. Muddy.
Olgierd|They still refuse to meet me, is that it?
Olgierd|And what's this?
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|We've brought some of Iris' things. Her favorite brush, her cherished doll. Ah, and this… for you.
Olgierd|Bank notes.
Novigrad Rich Woman 02|We paid off your debts, bought them out. To avoid bringing shame to the family.
Olgierd|So nice of Mama and Papa to remember me.
Iris|Olgierd?
Novigrad Rich Woman 02|Now you see his true nature? I warned you before the wedding.
Novigrad Rich Woman 02|A ruffian and a boor who keeps the company of bandits. Are you not afraid to live under one roof with that rabble?
Geralt|A lavish feast. Trying to impress the guests.
Geralt|Castel Ravello. A Toussaint wine. Expensive.
Geralt|Olgierd's wife liked flowers. Judging by the ornamentation, this might be hers.
Geralt|Seen this hairbrush. It was in bad shape in the real world.
Geralt|Silver thread, pearls… Doll must've cost a fortune.
Geralt|Not you again.
Geralt|Another dream of the past. Bet this one's incomplete, too.
Geralt|These were lit in the painting… but that's not all.
Geralt|Fire was burning in the painting… Still something missing, though.
Geralt|Candles also need lighting…
Geralt|That oughta do it.
Geralt|Just a little different than the painting.
<|endoftext|>
Iris|What… what time is it?
Olgierd|It's late. Sleep.
Iris|Up all night in your study again, I see… What've you got on your hands?
Olgierd|Nothing. Got a bit dirty, that's it.
Iris|Is that blood? Have you hurt yourself?
Olgierd|Ink stains, I was writing letters… I shall go to Oxenfurt soon. Perhaps you'd come with me?
Iris|Oh, that's a marvelous idea! A trip would do us both so much good!
Olgierd|Then it's decided. Now, time for bed. I'm exhausted.
Iris|I shan't fall asleep now. It's out of the question. Come, I shall finish your portrait.
Geralt|The bedchamber…
Geralt|A nightshirt… Never worn, I think.
Geralt|Towel's stained with blood.
Geralt|Bloodstained towel. Didn't wash it all off, got some on the towel.
Geralt|Wash basin. Hm… bloodstains on it.
Geralt|Bloodstains. Someone washed their hands, then wiped them dry on that towel.
Geralt|Wick's almost gone.
<|endoftext|>
Iris|Another monstrosity? I begged you to stop this. Those two are two too many as it is.
Olgierd|The dog and cat keep you company. This one will protect you, care for the house. No matter what happens.
Iris|Before, I wished to know what was going on in that head of yours. I thought perhaps I could help.
Iris|Now I care not the slightest what you think or how you feel.
Olgierd|I… feel nothin'.
Iris|Just as I no longer know if I still hate you. Go, Olgierd. I want you out of my sight.
Demon Dog|Olgierd von Everec failed to understand we'd never be able to replace him.
Demon Cat|His specter now casts a shadow over Lady Iris' every remembrance.
Demon Cat|I remember… We spent much time together here, the three of us.
Demon Dog|In silence.
Demon Cat|We'll take our places. The same as then.
Demon Dog|You do the rest.
Geralt|Single place setting, no others on the table.
Geralt|Animal hair.
Geralt|Lots of scratches on the floor. Hm… just here, though.
Geralt|Claw scratches.
Geralt|You actually ate from these bowls?
Demon Cat|Of course not. I already told you, we're not animals.
Demon Dog|But the Caretaker would set them out all the same. As ordered.
Geralt|So he was present, too.
Geralt|A platter… Hmm…
Geralt|Small bowl. For soup, maybe?
Geralt|A large clay bowl…
Geralt|Hmm… something's not right…
Geralt|Think this was yours.
Geralt|There we go.
Geralt|Got something wrong.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|"Blood Pacts, or On Foreign Presences."
Geralt|Hm. A tome about parleying with demons.
Geralt|Pentagram's here to bind summoned beings.
Geralt|Lines aren't all clear, though. Need chalk to fix them… then I can set out the candles.
Geralt|Blood? For some kind of magic, I bet.
Demon Cat|Master von Everec's study. Here he immersed himself in the arcane arts.
Geralt|Manor was depressingly gloomy in the winter.
Demon Cat|Ah! I did not expect that.
Geralt|Locked.
Demon Cat|You must find another way out.
Geralt|"The Gates of Mystery," "Between Worlds"? The library of an occultist.
Iris|Come back! We must talk!
Olgierd|Go away! I wish to be alone!
Iris|Not this time. Come out at once!
Olgierd|Leave me be. I merely want to work in peace.
Olgierd|Oudoianu feus! Soba camisa iada! Soba camisa aberaasas!
Olgierd|What other spell must I use, dammit?! I've tried them all! I wish to end our pact! I summon thee!
Olgierd|Damn it!
Olgierd|Fire! In here, quickly! The flames, douse the flames!
Geralt|Chalk.
Geralt|Egh… Black magic.
Geralt|That should do it. Now for the candles.
Geralt|Let's try this…
Geralt|Nothing.
Geralt|What about this…?
Geralt|Hmm. Not even a fizzle.
Geralt|How about this…
Geralt|Maybe this?
Geralt|Nope. Botched it, I guess.
Geralt|Hmm… need to think this through.
Geralt|All right, let's try this again…
Geralt|Dammit - smack in the middle of a raging blizzard! Gotta find shelter, get inside.
Geralt|Olgierd didn't let them in. They froze to death.
Geralt|Locked. Damn it all. Cellar - maybe I can get in that way.
Geralt|Beeswax candles…
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Nobleman 02|Furthermore, it is agreed that Iris shall be accorded the respect she is owed, that you shall heed her counsel and requests, and--
Olgierd|Get to the point, father. My patience runs thin.
Novigrad Nobleman 02|Gladly. On Iris' request, I declare this marriage null and void.
Olgierd|You vowed to remain with me "till death do us part."
Iris|And I've held to my vow. The Olgierd I married is no more.
Olgierd|Breaking a word once given does not come that easy. Believe me.
Olgierd|You shall stay here. Forever.
Novigrad Nobleman 02|Enough! You will not command us, you will--
Iris|Father! Father! Nooo!!
Olgierd|Servants! Take this carcass and feed it to the beasts!
Geralt|Olgierd, Iris… and her father?
Geralt|Her father must've been holding the contract…
Geralt|So that's how he whiled away the long winter evenings…
Geralt|A scrap of paper… Part of a document?
Geralt|And one more …
Geralt|Another one …
Geralt|And another …
Geralt|Another piece…
Geralt|Iris' father was holding the document. Gotta put the pieces in his hand.
Geralt|Hmm… a marriage contract between Iris and Olgierd…
Geralt|Not quite. Memory's still incomplete.
Geralt|No. Something's wrong…
Geralt|A beer tankard… but there was vodka in it.
Geralt|So that's how he whiled away the long winter evenings…
Geralt|Hmm… Nope.
Geralt|Drained… to the last drop.
Geralt|So this is when he started smoking…
Geralt|A knife… covered in blood. Guess Olgierd got the scars on his shoulders that winter…
Geralt|Think I placed it wrong.
<|endoftext|>
Demon Cat|We're almost at our journey's end.
Geralt|What's there?
Demon Cat|Iris von Everec's greatest fear.
Geralt|"My Dearest Wife…"
Geralt|Letter's from Olgierd to Iris.
Geralt|"Were I only as skilled with words as I am with my blade."
Geralt|"Especially now, when an icy void grips my heart."
Geralt|"I see how you look at me, and I see you wither."
Geralt|"I cannot help you, but I believe I can cease harming you."
Geralt|"This letter and this rose are my farewell. May you live in health and remember but the good times."
Geralt|"Olgierd."
<|endoftext|>
Iris|I'm sorry. I mistook you for another.
Geralt|For Olgierd?
Iris|I thought he'd returned. To me.
Geralt|What are you? A ghost? An illusion?
Iris|I am sadness.
Geralt|I've come for the violet rose Olgierd gave you--
Iris|On the day we saw one another for the last time. I dried it and placed it in our chamber. At my bedside.
Iris|I lay there for days, staring at it, until at last it crumbled into dust. As did I, soon after.
Geralt|So… the rose is gone?
Iris|Not from this world. Look. You buried my body, and the flower's bloomed once more.
Iris|And I… I was held in a deep, dark sleep. Only now have I awoken. Just like my beautiful rose.
Iris|Tell me, how is Olgierd? Healthy? Does he fare well?
Geralt|Shouldn't worry about him at all. He's no longer the man you loved.
Iris|So his heart remains hardened.
Iris|And did… did Olgierd mention me? What did he say?
Geralt|Not much, but I didn't ask about you. He just sent me to retrieve the rose.
Iris|The rose? The last I have left of him? His last gift.
Geralt|I need the rose. Will you give it to me?
Iris|It's so fragile… Look, the petal edges have turned crimson. As they were on the day I received it.
Iris|The one thing missing is the single drop of dew which slid down the leaf when I took the rose in hand. Or was it blood - because I'd pricked my finger? I can't remember.
Iris|You know, I never did read the letter from Olgierd. I didn't have to. And I needn't have kept the flower he left me.
Iris|I've come to a decision - I shall give you the rose.
Demon Cat|Our service thus ends. Thank you, stranger, for freeing us.
Demon Dog|Before we go, some advice - beware of the one called the Man of Glass. Stand in his way, and you'll meet a fate worse than death. Seek salvation in glass that can't be broken.
Geralt|Glass that can't be broken?
Demon Cat|So long.
Geralt|I'll remember you, Iris von Everec.
Iris|That no longer matters. Farewell.
Geralt|I can't take the rose.
Demon Cat|Is it not what you came for?
Geralt|Can't force Iris into… oblivion. She thinks and feels, still. And she's no danger to anyone but intruders.
Demon Dog|Look at her, look at her world. She's doomed to relive the painful past eternally. Take the rose, show her mercy.
Geralt|What should I do? What do you want me to do?
Iris|I do not know what I want.
Iris|I'm so very, very afraid…
Geralt|I won't decide your fate. I can't accept the rose.
Demon Dog|Will you leave empty-handed? What about your task?
Geralt|Rose stays with Iris.
Demon Cat|So that is how it's to be. Perhaps in the years to come another will appear to free us.
Iris|I don't know that you've chosen wisely. And though I feel no gratitude, I'll not send you away empty-handed.
Iris|Look, the petal edges darken. The flower closes, and I am overcome with sleep.
Iris|Goodnight, stranger. You must leave. The rose awaits outside this world. While I… I descend once more into my dream of what was.
Iris|Olgierd, I wish to be with Olgierd. To gaze again into those eyes, eyes the devil would be proud to have.
Geralt|Farewell.
Geralt|Painting's changed. Got the violet rose there now.
Geralt|And Iris, ready to see her husband again.
Geralt|You two - you want me to take the rose, trying to convince me. Why?
Demon Dog|We want to help Iris von Everec. And you.
Geralt|Generous demons? I don't buy it. Because you are demons, right?
Geralt|You were to serve Iris until the end of her days. End didn't come with her death, so you were sentenced to stay in the world of her torment for all time.
Geralt|Can't break the contract yourselves, so you need me to do it for you. If I take the rose, Iris'll cease to exist, but you'll also be freed.
Demon Cat|You're right. But are we wrong to want that? Our intentions are pure.
Demon Dog|We're but bit players in this tragedy, a performance that's gone on too long. We can't help the mistress, and her fate no longer moves us.
Demon Cat|Can we be blamed for simply wanting to leave the stage?
Geralt|Got a feeling the rose is important to you, more than a memento.
Iris|I remember so little… Yet when I think of my rose, I begin to recall what was.
Iris|The world around me turns real. And I-- My eyes open wide and I recognize things, remember who I am and who I was.
Geralt|Friend once told me about a case like this. Could be strong emotions that bind you to the rose, feelings we witchers call "pins." They're what keeps you in this world.
Iris|Like an insect pinned in a collection case? Horrible.
Geralt|Need to be honest. If I take the rose, you might cease to exist, as might the world you've built around you.
Iris|And what will happen then? Shall I be free of the suffering, the sadness? Is it the void that awaits?
Geralt|I don't know.
Iris|I don't wish to suffer any longer… but I fear there will be cold and darkness, until… there is nothing at all.
Geralt|Your husband… hunts out ever stronger sensations. He tempts fate. Because at heart he's unhappy.
Iris|At heart he is stone. So nothing has changed.
Geralt|Olgierd's… fine. No ailments, in any case.
Iris|Always healthy as an ox, always escaping trouble without a scratch.
Geralt|Your husband's got a powerful enemy. Gaunter O'Dimm - know the name?
Iris|I curse the day I first heard it.
Geralt|Who is he? And how'd he step into your lives?
Iris|It's my fault. It was for me Olgierd summoned the Man of Glass. And it was my fault he wished for riches, then immortality for us both…
Iris|Olgierd will best O'Dimm, won't he? Now tell me - how is my husband?
Iris|When you placed the sketchbook on my grave, I remembered learning to draw my husband's face.
Iris|When you placed the painting on my grave, I remembered the day of my marriage.
Iris|When you placed the hairbrush on my grave, I remembered brushing my hair while Olgierd watched in silence.
Geralt|Saw you before, but you weren't yourself-- Then I saw you again in your memories.
Iris|We've met? I don't recall…
Iris|I had bad dreams - that is all I know.
Iris|You're not him…
Geralt|Wait. I wanna talk.
Iris|Not here, not in this place.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Tools're so organized it's scary.
Geralt|Looks like someone cleaned it. Recently.
Geralt|Fresh manure.
Geralt|A grave? Here?
Geralt|Someone dragged a wounded man through here.
Geralt|Prints from cleated boots. Leading from the back of the garden.
Geralt|Rope looks new, bucket's been repaired.
Geralt|Seeds and bulbs. Someone's still planting flowers.
Geralt|Another intruder buried by the caretaker.
Geralt|A lock pick? Must've been the other thief's…
<|endoftext|>
Iris|Begone…
Iris|Intruder…
Iris|This is my house…
Iris|Leave before it's too late…
Iris|My house…
Iris|Turn back…
Iris|You will die here…
Iris|Thief…
Iris|I'm afraid…
Iris|Who comes…?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Rather worn… Used often. Wonder by who.
Geralt|Wood's rotted, completely.
Geralt|Water's ice-cold. Mountain stream cold.
Geralt|Someone's still tending to the flowerbeds. No violet rose, though.
Geralt|What the hell was that?
Geralt|Hm, fire damage. Interesting.
Geralt|Must've been the way down to the cellar.
Geralt|Hm. Seems I can't pass back through.
Geralt|Hm. Someone out to stop me?
Geralt|Don't know this deity. Strange, Olgierd doesn't seem the pious type.
Geralt|Guess thieves tried to lower the statue with ropes, but something scared them off.
Geralt|Bench was wiped clean recently. So was the floor.
Geralt|A hairbrush. Floral ornamentation. Pretty.
Geralt|Lovely couple.
Geralt|Sketchbook's signed "Iris."
Geralt|Beehives. Well-maintained but dormant.
Geralt|Ugh… Hope I'm near the bedchamber.
Geralt|Dammit.
Geralt|Mighty rusty and covered in creepers.
Geralt|Need another way in.
Geralt|Hm. Tidy. And everything's clean, ready for a meal to be served.
Geralt|Caretaker must still set the table.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Don't like this place.
Demon Cat|Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
Geralt|The parlor.
Geralt|Well, well… did not live in poverty, those two.
Geralt|Painting's destroyed.
Geralt|Dammit! Stupid bugs.
Geralt|What now?
Demon Dog|Come inside.
Demon Cat|You'll find more memories in there.
Demon Dog|Then he went upstairs.
Geralt|So let's follow him.
Demon Dog|He lied.
Demon Cat|Didn't want to involve her in this.
Demon Dog|He deceived her. And himself.
Demon Cat|Oh, never mind. Let's go to the study.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Kendrick? Kendrick? You there?!
Geralt|Not so loud.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Aaah! Gods, scared me half to--
Geralt|Not so loud, I said. Fog's not natural. Could be something in there, hiding. Foglets or err-nymphs, for example.
Geralt|Don't want to attract them. Believe me.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|F-foglets? Ah, Sweet Mother Melitele, why'd I ever come 'ere…?
Geralt|Good question. What are you doing here?
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|See… Kendrick and me, we thought, manor's been empty all these years, full o' fine things goin' to rot…
Geralt|Mhm. So you're a thief.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Thieves steal from the livin'! What's the 'arm takin' from the dead?
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Kendrick went to open the door, I stood watch. Suddenly heard his lamp smash… then nothing, quiet. Called out to 'im, but…
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Wh-wh… what was that? One o' them foglets you spoke of?
Geralt|No.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Phew, that's a stone off my--
Geralt|I'll see what that was and look for your partner. You--
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Ain't about to wait around. I'm out of here!
Geralt|Kendrick fellow - who is he?
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|I-- We's partners. Sneak into derelict 'ouses. Always somethin' valuable lyin' about.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Kendrick? Kendrick!
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Hey! Ye hear me?
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Anyone there?
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Two pints! And be quick about it!
Novigrad Rich Woman 02|Ugh, please, good sir - a bit of courtesy!
Novigrad Citizen Man 02|So I look up, and, Bob's your uncle, he downs half the barrel in one draught!
Mirror|Geralt! Over here!
Novigrad Drunk 01|Oi, whitey-locks! You's the look of a man who knows how to drink!
Geralt|Thanks. Some other time.
Novigrad Drunk 01|Hey now, don't make me beg! It's my treat!
Geralt|Show off.
Mirror|Of course I am. Wouldn't you be? Time's a marvelous plaything.
Geralt|And a great spice to use in gingerbread.
Mirror|So… you were listening.
Mirror|Indeed, occasionally I find time manipulation irresistible. Controlling it offers so many appetizing opportunities.
Mirror|Like spiking the soup of unsavory individuals with appropriately ghastly things.
Geralt|So, to what do I owe the pleasure?
Mirror|I wanted to congratulate you. You acquitted yourself splendidly with Olgierd. In fact, you've almost satisfied your debt.
Geralt|Was supposed to fulfill his three wishes. Did just that. This is where you remove the brand. 'Cause we're even.
Mirror|Nearly. To fulfill the terms of the contract to the letter, you must do one more thing - draw Olgierd to the Temple of Lilvani.
Geralt|We never discussed that.
Mirror|Oh, but we did. As a man of the world you should know every contract contains a catch or two. Small print, which nevertheless changes the ultimate meaning of the pact.
Mirror|This applies to oral contracts as well. Recall that I said, and I quote, "I believe, however, that all will end well. And once it does, we three shall meet and thank one another for the voyage we shared" - end quote.
Geralt|Mh, yeah, I remember.
Mirror|Fulfill your end of the bargain, and I will remove the brand.
Mirror|That was the last time you interrupted me while I was talking to someone.
Olgierd Bandit 01|What the devil?
Olgierd Bandit 01|Why's there a fly in my soup?
Olgierd Bandit 01|Was waitin', had an eye out for you. Didn't see you come in. How's it you're here?
Geralt|I'm a witcher. Superhuman quickness - just one of my many qualities.
Olgierd Bandit 01|You toss this fly in my soup?!
Geralt|No. Now listen carefully. Tell your ataman to come to the Temple of Lilvani. It's south of here. Entrance is inside a cave.
Novigrad Rich Woman 02|Aaaaaa!
Olgierd Bandit 01|What's the commotion?
Geralt|Lilvani's Temple. Got it?
Olgierd Bandit 01|Aye. Got it.
Olgierd Bandit 01|Hold there!
Olgierd Bandit 01|Your friend, the medic - she were here. Asked that you look in on her.
Geralt|Thanks.
Geralt|Old witcher's trick. I concentrate real, real hard, and I can control time and space.
Geralt|Who are you, really?
Mirror|Gaunter O'Dimm, also known--
Geralt|Not what I'm asking.
Mirror|Ah, so you'd rather know what it is I do?
Mirror|In brief, I give folk what they ask for. You might say I simply grant their wishes.
Geralt|And drop them in a world of hurt.
Mirror|No, not I. That would be their poorly formulated wishes.
Mirror|I'm no cheat. I give folk what they want, nothing more. That they oft desire unworthy things - that is entirely the fault of their rotten natures.
Geralt|You're not human, that's clear. So what are you? A demon? A djinn?
Mirror|Do you really wish to know?
Geralt|Yes.
Mirror|No, Geralt, you don't. This one time I shall spare you and not grant your wish.
Mirror|All who have learned my true name are now either dead or have met an even worse fate. Yet I still need you.
Geralt|That'd be downright noble… if you didn't always demand something in return.
Mirror|Law of the market. I was not the one to coin the phrase "Nothing comes free."
Geralt|You actually control time, or is this just some conjurer's trick?
Mirror|What difference does it make?
Geralt|A big one.
Mirror|Hmm. Let us say time has always fascinated me, so I taught myself how best to use it.
Geralt|Why time, of all things?
Mirror|Geralt, there are four dimensions - length, width, height… and time. What would you have me fall in love with - width? Come, now - tsk tsk, tsk.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Shani?
Shani|Oh, Geralt. Good thing you're here.
Geralt|What happened? Somebody break in?
Shani|This? Ah, no. Just getting ready to move.
Geralt|What? When? Where to?
Shani|Ah, not what I wanted to talk to you about, or at least not only, but…
Shani|I'm leaving, Geralt. The eastern front beckons. I'm Kaedwen bound.
Geralt|So, learn anything about Olgierd?
Shani|Well, I abandoned the books quickly. Decided that if I was going to learn the truth, I'd need to find someone who knows him.
Geralt|Find anyone?
Shani|Turned out I didn't need to look far. A colleague at the academy, an assistant to Professor Premethine Shakeslock, claims Olgierd von Everec met with the professor multiple times.
Shani|Apparently Olgierd asked the professor to do some research. Professor got so worked up doing it, he went daffy. Started jealously guarding his notes. Wouldn't even let his assistant look at them.
Geralt|The professor - where'll I find him?
Shani|Here in Oxenfurt. Cloistered inside his house on Academy grounds. Mage hunters guard his door.
Geralt|Need to talk to this professor.
Shani|We'll go together. Redanian guards all over the academy. Doubt you'll get in alone.
Geralt|Guards've never stopped me, you know that.
Shani|Mhm. But wound these, and I'll have to patch them up.
Shani|Besides, we might run into a friend. Get inside free and easy.
Geralt|Mage hunters at the door… He under house arrest?
Shani|I can't say, really. Some of the faculty think him a traitor - say he sold out to the hunters for a hefty pouch of gold.
Shani|The assistant, on the other hand, insists the professor wants them there to protect him. I don't know what from.
Geralt|What's your guess?
Shani|He's certainly useful to them. A specialist in black magic and the occult? Must be a trove of knowledge.
Shani|If he's really gone off his nutter, I wouldn't be surprised to see them using him.
Geralt|Never mentioned you'd be moving. Any intention to, either.
Shani|I didn't know I would be. Found out this morning.
Shani|Two soldiers came to my door. Said Redania needs me again.
Geralt|Couldn't turn 'em down, just say no?
Shani|Ah, perhaps I could've. But I didn't want to. Treating the ill and wounded, it's my calling. No place I'm needed more than at the front.
Geralt|Can't you reconsider… and stay?
Shani|Geralt, what for?
Shani|The wedding, the time we've spent together… it was nice. But you have your life, and I have mine. We-- This doesn't make sense long-term. You know that as well as I do.
Geralt|Well… you take care of yourself.
Shani|You too, Geralt.
Geralt|I understand. Any chance we'll see each other again?
Shani|Someday, I'm sure.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|So how're things at the academy these days?
Shani|You mean since Radovid shut it down?
Geralt|I mean, is it well guarded.
Shani|Might be all it is. Many of the faculty fled to the far north. The braver ones stayed, but assumed the guises of tailors and laundresses. Why?
Geralt|Just curious. Scholars seemed to have adopted mage tactics. They in the same bind?
Shani|To Radovid, there's little difference between the two.
Geralt|Seems to tolerate you well enough.
Shani|Because he needs me. For now.
Geralt|So, the eastern front, and then…?
Shani|Depends where they send me.
Geralt|Wherever it is, take care of yourself.
Shani|Always do. So don't worry.
Shani|Geralt, where do you think you're going?
Shani|We were bound for the academy!
<|endoftext|>
Redanian Soldier 01|Halt. By order of King Radovid, no one's allowed inside the Academy.
Shani|Not even lecturers?
Redanian Soldier 02|No one means no one.
Shani|See you've become quite the stickler, Norbert. You were much kinder when I was patching you up. By the way, how's your knee?
Redanian Soldier 02|Fine, dandy. As if no arrow ever struck it.
Shani|Consider yourself a lucky man. 'Cause if I'd not decided to operate, you'd be a cripple to the end of your days.
Redanian Soldier 02|Ahem… Bruno?
Redanian Soldier 01|Eh?
Redanian Soldier 02|Maybe we ought to let her in? She's a decent lass, not like to steal nothin'.
Redanian Soldier 01|Hm, all right. But alone. Witcher'll draw too much attention. I'd rather not get shite from the captain on his account.
Shani|Here's what we'll do. I'll go in, then help you sneak in around the back.
Geralt|How?
Shani|Don't know. But I'll figure something out. Usually aren't nearly as many guards on the riverside.
Geralt|Agreed.
Shani|All right. Let me in.
<|endoftext|>
Shani|Geralt! Psst! Are you there?
Geralt|Yeah, I'm here.
Shani|Grab the line!
Geralt|Where'd you get the rope?
Shani|Long story.
Shani|But we've done well. Professor Shakeslock's house is at the end of this street.
Shani|Witch hunters guard the door. Doubt I'll be able to sweet talk them.
Geralt|Been a huge help already, Shani. Thanks.
Shani|It was nothing, really. You'd have done the same for me.
Shani|If you wish to see me again before I go, I'll be at home. Packing'll take some time yet.
Geralt|All right. Be seeing you.
Shani|Geralt! Coming or not?
Geralt|Yeah, hold on.
<|endoftext|>
Crazy Scholar|Franco? Is that you? Leave the bedpan in the usual spot.
Crazy Scholar|And take the platter, I shan't be eating today.
Geralt|Professor Shakeslock?
Crazy Scholar|Who the blazes--?! How'd you get in?! Get out! I know nothing. Don't wish to know anything. Understand?! No, no, no - out!
Geralt|Not gonna hurt you.
Crazy Scholar|That demon sent you. I'm sure of it!
Geralt|No one sent me.
Crazy Scholar|You lie. I may be blind, but I sense unclean powers better than anyone. Why do you think the witch hunters guard me like a treasure?
Geralt|I'm a witcher.
Crazy Scholar|Hm, a mutant? Hm, hm… Yeah… could be…
Geralt|Came here 'cause I need information. Think you might be the only man who has it.
Crazy Scholar|Hm, a witcher. Then it follows I needn't fear. I'm hardly a post-Conjunction creature.
Geralt|What did Olgierd von Everec want from you?
Crazy Scholar|I curse the day I first set eyes upon the man!
Crazy Scholar|He appeared at my doorstep one day, offering a sack of gold were I only to find out who Gaunter O'Dimm is, and how to get rid of him.
Crazy Scholar|I agreed. Such matters are my speciality. And I needed the coin. I pored over countless tomes, delved into obscure incidents and analyzed folk legends.
Crazy Scholar|I went so far as to travel to Nilfgaard, the library there, where at last I hit upon the mysterious entity's trail.
Crazy Scholar|There are records of encounters dating back thousands of years, in many cultures, under many names. But always as Evil incarnate. In this land we call him Gaunter O'Dimm. At times, Master Mirror, or the Man of Glass.
Crazy Scholar|In deciphering the ancient scrawlings I went blind. Yet I learned a great deal. For example, that he plays with his victims. And thrives on pacts above all else.
Crazy Scholar|Seemingly harmless contracts which drive their parties to madness.
Geralt|Olgierd sign one of these pacts with him?
Crazy Scholar|Brilliant deduction. But have you guessed why? You must know he came from a wealthy, influential line. He must have if the family of his betrothed accepted him.
Crazy Scholar|Yet did you know his fortunes soured? He himself became an outcast, impoverished. Iris' family, a powerful house, could not accept this, would not marry their daughter to a nobody.
Crazy Scholar|Olgierd wished to elope - the further away, the better. Yet Iris refused to cut her family ties.
Geralt|Quite the predicament.
Crazy Scholar|Indeed. Their luck turned yet darker when a wandering witch mentioned a solution - a man who would grant any wish. His name - Master Mirror.
Crazy Scholar|The rest follows naturally. Olgierd and O'Dimm - a meeting at a crossroads, a wish, a pact signed in blood, and a price to be paid.
Crazy Scholar|Olgierd was to sacrifice one he loved… O'Dimm delights in difficult choices. He knew Olgierd loved two in this world - his betrothed, and his brother, Vlodimir…
Crazy Scholar|Olgierd chose, and soon thereafter married his beloved Iris, his fortune restored…
Geralt|Why was Olgierd out to get rid of O'Dimm? He'd gotten what he wanted.
Crazy Scholar|Had he? Hmph. His heart had turned cold as ice. His feelings for his wife, for whom he'd sacrificed his brother, had withered. He'd lost all he'd loved. Had he wanted any of this?
Crazy Scholar|No. O'Dimm grants what you wish, not what you want. All who sign a pact learn the difference - and die by it.
Geralt|All? No way to get rid of him?
Crazy Scholar|Kill him, you mean? Kill Evil? Hmph. No. Yet the annals tell of a man who dissolved his pact - by defeating O'Dimm at his own game.
Geralt|Meaning?
Crazy Scholar|O'Dimm wields contracts, word-traps, duels of wits. Challenge him to such a duel. He'll agree - and can be beaten. But remember, there is only ever one stake. The sole thing he truly desires - human souls.
Geralt|Thanks. Helped me a lot.
Crazy Scholar|Good. Very good. Ah, to feel useful after so many years locked up, living in fear - why, it's pleasance itself.
Geralt|O'Dimm left a mark on my face. Any way to get it off?
Crazy Scholar|A mark? No mention in the tomes… Strange… Unless… unless it will disappear once your pact is fulfilled.
Geralt|If I challenge him, end the pact that way - will it go away?
Crazy Scholar|That I do not know. The one man who's succeeded bore no mark.
Geralt|So, did Olgierd kill his own brother?
Crazy Scholar|No, no, no… Deduce, witcher. O'Dimm acts directly or indirectly? Hm? Olgierd merely signed the blood letter, the next day his brother was dead…
Geralt|Olgierd tell you all that?
Crazy Scholar|He had to. How else was I to diagnose his case?
Geralt|Make it sound like an illness.
Crazy Scholar|It is worse. Many illnesses are treatable, but play with evil… and medicine can be much harder to find.
Geralt|What's with the surroundings? These runes - what do they mean?
Crazy Scholar|They protect me. Here, Evil cannot touch me.
Geralt|How do you know?
Crazy Scholar|He told me himself. Paid me a visit once. A fascinating meeting that was. I was blind already but saw him clearly. He smiled at me.
Crazy Scholar|Said he was honored I'd taken such an interest in him. He wished to thank me and explained he'd taken a similar interest in me.
Crazy Scholar|He drew the circle and said I'd be safe within it. His way of "repaying" me, you see…
Geralt|Ever tried to leave it?
Crazy Scholar|If you'd heard how he said it, you'd be as certain as I am what leaving would bring.
Geralt|Know anything else about the man?
Crazy Scholar|Gaunter O'Dimm is no man! He is Evil! Evil which assumes various forms. Forget about him, or die.
Geralt|You're alive.
Crazy Scholar|Alive… yet I live in constant fear born of what I've learned about him.
Geralt|Why are there guards outside your door? You a prisoner?
Crazy Scholar|"Protective custody," that's the phrase. Protective, hmph! When I cannot decide my own fate, cannot breathe without their permission.
Geralt|What do they want from you?
Crazy Scholar|You may not be aware, but I am one of the foremost experts on the occult. Living experts, that is. My mentor was the outstanding Professor Lionel van--
Geralt|And you're cooperating with the witch hunters now?
Crazy Scholar|Cooperating, hmph! As if I had a choice. They're ignorant, but not enough to ignore what I know about magic, witches, sorceresses, what have you. Knowledge they use for barbaric ends, but that's beyond my control.
Geralt|What demon?
Crazy Scholar|Feigned ignorance? Hmph. Please. You know.
Crazy Scholar|Gaunter O'Dimm… Evil incarnate.
Geralt|He didn't send me, but he is why I'm here.
Geralt|Poor wretch…
<|endoftext|>
Olgierd|Strange choice of locale. Guessing there's a reason for it?
Geralt|You're an art lover. Thought you'd appreciate the place.
Olgierd|A witcher with aesthetic sensibility? Forgive my disbelief.
Olgierd|But since we're here, I believe you have something for me.
Geralt|Fulfilled your third wish.
Olgierd|What is this?
Geralt|A canvas. And on it, your house, your wife and the rose you gave her that day.
Olgierd|This is not what I asked for.
Geralt|Phrased your wish wrong.
Olgierd|Not the first time. And it's been my downfall.
Olgierd|So beautiful… she looks alive.
Geralt|She is, in a way. Iris painted this, then… entered it.
Olgierd|What? How…?
Geralt|I don't know… she loved you, maybe she just wanted to be close again?
Olgierd|She wished to be close? After all that passed?
Olgierd|Iris… what a mess we made of it all… If I'd only known then how it would end…
Olgierd|Heh? Ah… agh! Hu-uh-oh… Ogh! Argh…
Mirror|Sorry to have kept you waiting.
Mirror|So glad to see everyone's made it.
Mirror|How do you feel, von Everec? A little… less troubled, lighter on the heart?
Olgierd|O'Dimm. What do you want?
Mirror|What do you mean, "what"? Your soul.
Olgierd|You forget. The pact states you can take it only once you've fulfilled three wishes and--
Mirror|And we stand together on the Moon.
Mirror|Well, what do you know.
Olgierd|What--? No. We… we had a pact.
Olgierd|The Moon is there. THERE! Not…
Olgierd|Here…
Mirror|I gave you what you wished for. Here, on the moon, our contract you fulfill.
Olgierd|You… whoreson…
Olgierd|You cheated me.
Mirror|I never cheat.
Mirror|It is done. Your soul belongs to me.
Olgierd|Aaaaaaargh…
Mirror|Ahh!
Mirror|At last, it's over.
Mirror|We must meet again one day. Business with you is pure pleasure.
Geralt|Gonna remove the brand?
Mirror|Ah, right away. Done.
Mirror|Now tell me what reward you've chosen.
Geralt|Wanna be fast. So fast no one'll ever catch me.
Mirror|Hmm. Interesting wish. I think I've just the thing.
Mirror|Take this. Place it on your steed, and you will ride swift as the wind.
Geralt|What now? Off to find another poor fool?
Mirror|Haven't decided yet. But I do know if I ever have trouble collecting a debt, I shall turn to a witcher.
Geralt|Never wanna go hungry again.
Mirror|Sounds practical. And can be arranged.
Geralt|What's this?
Mirror|A horn of plenty. From this day forward, whenever you're hungry, reach in to find something to eat.
Geralt|An endless supply of vodka. Or clear spirit. Either'll do, really.
Mirror|Heheh, now there's a wish I understand. It's as good as done.
Geralt|Not impressed. Seems pretty ordinary.
Mirror|Appearances are oft deceiving. The carafe is bottomless. As long as you have it, you will never want for liquor.
Geralt|I wanna be rich.
Mirror|Rich? Truly? Hm, banal… but all right, I gave my word. You asked, you shall receive.
Mirror|That should do the trick.
Geralt|Don't want a thing from you.
Mirror|Are you certain? I am capable of a great deal…
Geralt|Never been surer. Goodbye, O'Dimm.
Geralt|Tell me where to find Ciri, my--
Mirror|Adopted daughter, I know. Sadly, I can't be of service.
Geralt|Why not?
Mirror|There are certain things even I cannot meddle with.
Mirror|Ciri is hidden from my gaze, she's beyond my reach.
Mirror|But finding her's not what should concern you most - because you will, I'm certain of it.
Geralt|So what should?
Mirror|A great danger lies in wait. If you wish, I can tell you how you might evade it. Unless you'd prefer to ask for something else?
Geralt|You know who Ciri is, so you know how much she means to me. Of course I want to keep her from any danger.
Mirror|Then there's a few things you must remember.
Mirror|There will come a time when she will come to you defeated, resigned. Find a way to make her laugh.
Mirror|There will come a time when one will betray her. Let her vent her rage.
Mirror|There will come a time when she will grieve for a friend. Grieve with her.
Mirror|There will come a time when fear will engulf her. Instill courage in her, but do not act in her stead.
Mirror|And never, ever let her feel as if you've sold her out.
Geralt|If I'm sure to find her, that's good enough for me. Handle the rest myself.
Mirror|Then my original offer stands.
Geralt|Wait.
Mirror|Do not interfere, witcher. Remember what I did to the last fool who interrupted me?
Geralt|You grant wishes, right? Grant mine and release him.
Mirror|He must repay his debt.
Geralt|Let him go, and I'll take it on, we'll call it mine.
Mirror|You wish to give your soul for his?
Geralt|No, but we can play for them. I lose, you take mine and Olgierd's. But if I win, you release us both.
Mirror|What do you propose we play? Gwent?
Geralt|Don't know… Maybe we can bet… on a challenge. You know I'm good at accomplishing the impossible. Seen me do it.
Mirror|Hmm… very well. But we shall do this my way.
Geralt|Think she missed you - the real you. She wanted the pact to expire, so you could be yourself again. How you were before. No matter the price.
Geralt|My guess is she wanted to punish you. So she helped me fulfill your wish.
Olgierd|Can't blame her. After all that's happened, she's every right to detest me.
Geralt|Fulfilled the third wish.
Olgierd|How do I know this to be the rose? Very well might've picked this up at the Oxenfurt market an hour ago.
Geralt|Look closely at it.
Geralt|Got it from Iris. It was the last thing that bound her to this world.
Olgierd|What?
Geralt|I think… think she loved you. Meant this as a token of that love.
Olgierd|She loved me? After all that's passed?
Olgierd|Iris… what a mess we made of it all… If I'd only known then how it would end…
Olgierd|Heh? Ah… agh! Hu-uh-oh… Ogh! Argh…
Geralt|Iris was tired of living half-alive, half-dead. Think she just wanted it to end.
Olgierd|Can't blame her. I condemned her to terrible suffering.
Geralt|Decided she'd treat you like you once treated her. The rose is a symbol of your parting. And a punishment.
Olgierd|I suppose I deserve that…
Geralt|Wasn't me who chose it.
Olgierd|I assumed so.
Geralt|Place like any other. Could easily have met somewhere else.
Olgierd|Yet we've met here. And something tells me that's not purely coincidental.
Olgierd|Wha-- What's happenin'?
Olgierd|I feel as though… as though… a hot iron's pierced my chest.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Wha… what's happening?
Mirror|You wished to play, so let us play.
Mirror|I shall tell you a riddle. Solve it, and both you and Olgierd will be free.
Geralt|And if I don't?
Mirror|Hahahaha, then we'll all three go for a wild ride. It's what you proposed, is it not?
Geralt|The riddle - lemme hear it.
Mirror|To all things and men I appertain, and yet by some am shunned and disdained.
Mirror|Fondle and ogle me, till you're insane, but no blow can harm me, cause me pain.
Mirror|Children delight in me, elders take fright, fair maids rejoice and spin.
Mirror|Cry, and I weep, yawn, and I sleep, smile, and I shall grin.
Geralt|What was that supposed to be?
Mirror|You tell me. What am I?
Geralt|You're going down.
Mirror|We shall see, my friend.
Mirror|You must find me before the sand in the hourglass runs out.
Mirror|Ready? Let's begin!
Geralt|Didn't quite catch the riddle. Mind repeating it?
Mirror|To all things and men I appertain, and yet by some am shunned and disdained.
Mirror|Fondle and ogle me till you're insane, but no blow can harm me, cause me pain.
Mirror|Children delight in me, elders take fright, fair maids rejoice and spin.
Mirror|Cry, and I weep, yawn, and I sleep, smile, and I too shall grin.
<|endoftext|>
Mirror|Oh, awful! You're doing terribly. Remember, you can always give up.
Mirror|As I see it, you will never find me. Never.
Geralt|That's cheating!
Mirror|Which only ever makes the game more interesting. Hahahahahaha…
Mirror|Seek, Geralt, seek!
Geralt|Gotta be some mirror here you won't shatter.
Mirror|Haha, seek and ye shall find. Perhaps.
Geralt|Hm, wonder how you'll shatter a sheet of water…
Geralt|What is this place?
Mirror|Haha, you like it?
Mirror|Plenty more where it came from!
Mirror|Just remember - you must find me before time runs out.
Mirror|Really, Geralt - unable to resist a few shiny coins?
Mirror|I truly expected more of you.
Mirror|Especially since time is short.
Geralt|Monsters weren't part of the deal!
Mirror|My world, my rules.
Mirror|What is it about swords that turns men into utter fools when they see one for the taking?
Mirror|Through howling winds, pouring rain, with their life hanging by a thread…
Mirror|Which reminds me - time is running out.
Geralt|Mirror… so this is where you're hiding?
Mirror|Hahahaha, come now, you didn't expect it to be THAT easy, did you?
Geralt|Damn you, O'Dimm!
Mirror|Hahahaha… Point for me.
Geralt|Can't keep doing that forever!
Mirror|Care to wager on it?
Geralt|Do that all you want. I'll still get you.
Mirror|So you say, yet I wait and wait, and nothing… You've yet to find me.
Geralt|There was water here, once. Maybe there's a way to bring it back…
Geralt|Rushing water… behind this wall. Break down the wall, and the water'll rush through here…
Geralt|Repeat the riddle!
Mirror|To all things and men I appertain, and yet by some am shunned and disdained.
Mirror|Fondle and ogle me till you're insane, but no blow can harm me, cause me pain.
Mirror|Children delight in me, elders take fright, fair maids rejoice and spin.
Mirror|Cry, and I weep, yawn, and I sleep, smile, and I too shall grin.
Geralt|To all things and men I appertain, and yet by some am shunned and disdained.
Geralt|Fondle and ogle me till you're insane, but no blow can harm me, cause me pain.
Geralt|Hm. What could that be?
Geralt|Children delight in me, elders take fright, fair maids rejoice and spin.
Geralt|Cry, and I weep, yawn, and I sleep, smile, and I too shall grin.
Geralt|Dammit, what are you?
Geralt|A family tomb.
Geralt|"To all I appertain, by some am shunned and disdained"… Could be "family," I guess.
Geralt|Wouldn't match much else in the riddle, though.
Geralt|Children delight in me, elders take fright, fair maids rejoice and spin.
Geralt|Children and young folk like swings. Could be scary to old folk, too…
Geralt|Doesn't fit the other verses, though.
Geralt|"Cry, and I weep, yawn, and I sleep, smile, and I too shall grin…"
Geralt|Hmm… Something that repeats all I do? Maybe… an echo?
Geralt|Echo…
Mirror|No dice. You can't possibly ogle an echo.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Master Mirror… agh, the details don't matter. I beat him. You're free.
Olgierd|I thank you. Though I've no notion what to do with this freedom, now.
Olgierd|Mirror took everything. Everything I loved, all I held dear…
Geralt|Not true. Got your heart back.
Olgierd|A bitter victory. Now at last I sense how much I've lost.
Olgierd|I've a heart again, yet all it feels is grief, sadness and defeat. My life is a ruin.
Geralt|You've handled tougher situations. You'll figure this one out.
Geralt|Got a company of faithful comrades waiting. Got a home, your fortune…
Olgierd|No. I cannot live as I did before.
Geralt|So what'll you do?
Olgierd|I don't know.
Olgierd|But one thing's clear - it's time I took fate into my own hands. Lived life anew… and truly, this time.
Geralt|Sounds like a plan.
Olgierd|I'll never forget what you did for me, witcher.
Olgierd|I have something for you.
Geralt|Can't accept this.
Olgierd|You can and must. This saber's been in my family for generations. Even when I'd lost all else, it remained at my side. Means a great deal to me.
Geralt|All the more reason why I can't take it.
Olgierd|Do me the honor. This'll mark the start of my new life - and such a weapon could be right useful to you.
Geralt|Thank you.
Olgierd|Ow.
Geralt|Sorry.
Olgierd|You needn't be.
Olgierd|I thank you again, Geralt. And good luck on the Path.
Geralt|Good luck to you, too.
Geralt|Hm, can't say I envy you. As the saying goes, careful what you wish for.
Olgierd|Oh, I shall be, believe me.
Olgierd|Actually, I've a better idea - I'll never wish for anything again.
Olgierd|It's time I took fate into my own hands. Lived life anew… and truly, this time.
Geralt|O'Dimm decided to have some fun at my expense. Devised a game I was supposed to lose.
Geralt|Seems he'd forgotten the training you put me through - in doing the undoable.
Olgierd|Sought only to protect myself. In doing so, I put you in harm's way. Forgive me.
Geralt|Hm. Well, don't have to worry about him anymore. You're safe. And free.
Olgierd|So, any better?
Geralt|Yeah, thanks.
Geralt|Wine's revived me a bit.
Olgierd|This plonk could revive a corpse. An exquisitely rank vintage.
Olgierd|You know what, though? It's good at last to taste something… real.
Olgierd|Ugh - so, have at it. Tell me what the blazes just happened.
Olgierd|Your brand's gone - guessing that's a good sign?
Geralt|First off, you tell me what it's like to have a heart of stone.
Olgierd|Ah, it's wonderful at the start.
Olgierd|You feel no fear, no angst… but also no concern, no care for anyone, not even those you loved.
Olgierd|And gradually you lose them… Well, you know how it ended.
Geralt|What about your senses? Taste, smell?
Olgierd|All there. At first, I savored the world like never before. It was stronger, more clear.
Geralt|How's that possible?
Olgierd|I did not wish for a heart of stone. That was a mere… side effect.
Olgierd|I wished to win back Iris' hand and have my fortune restored. And then to live like there was no tomorrow.
Olgierd|And thus I lived until… until I ceased to feel anything at all.
Olgierd|What a joy to be done with it. Because I am done, right? Will you tell me what happened?
<|endoftext|>
Palmerin|Geralt of Rivia!
Milton|Hah! Sit with us, witcher!
Geralt|Not sure who I expected, but sure didn't expect knights-errant.
Milton|You see, Palmerin? I told you. The griffin at White Orchard - I knew that were we only to follow the tracks of its slayer, we would, in the end, find Geralt.
Geralt|Milton de Peyrac-Peyran and Palmerin de Launfal. Good to see you both. Been years.
Palmerin|Be assured, we share your joy.
Milton|You must forgive us our, uh, surroundings. When we pledged to place the village under our protection, the village elder gave us this hut as our lodgings. He swore it is the best hut in the village.
Geralt|Get involved in some squabble?
Palmerin|We discovered that in retreating, the Redanian garrison had left this land's tillers at the mercy of numerous plagues, the tyranny of bandits the most onerous among them.
Palmerin|These plunderers shall soon descend on this village to collect tribute. Milton and I will dissuade them.
Milton|We are both sworn to fight injustice and oppression wherever they rear their heads. The matter does not concern you, of course, but do us the kindness of waiting? Once we have dealt with these marauders, we have a matter we must present to you.
Geralt|So, plan to go out and meet the bandits when they arrive? Fight them?
Milton|Palmerin wishes first to appeal to their sense of decency, haha. But I expect they will be deaf to this.
Geralt|Yeah. Completely.
Palmerin|We must afford them a chance to stand down. Many a hardened outlaw has left the path of wrongdoing upon hearing words of admonition.
Geralt|Doesn't happen in these lands. Ever.
Palmerin|If they do not heed my reprimand, we at least will know we have done all within our means to evade bloodshed.
Geralt|Fine. Naturally, I'll help when Palmerin's rhetoric falls on deaf ears.
Milton|Excellent! Then we've but to wait for the rogues to arrive!
Geralt|No point fighting bandits. Kill these, and others just as bad or possibly worse'll come in to fill the void.
Palmerin|To cast a blind eye upon evil - there is no honor in it!
Geralt|Can't stay here to protect these folk from the dangers that come their way daily. Saw what I saw, heard them urge you to leave these raiders alone. Must have good reason to do that.
Palmerin|Do you suggest that should we help, we assume responsibility for their fate, for their lives? This burden we cannot agree to bear.
Milton|Geralt speaks wisely. We know neither this land, nor its peoples, nor its customs. And we have come with another duty altogether.
Palmerin|Ehh, how I long to return to Toussaint - where all is simpler.
Milton|Soon, my friend, soon. First, let us convey our missive to Geralt in the manner tradition ordains.
Geralt|So, fess up, what brings you such a long way?
Palmerin|We are to deliver Her Grace the Duchess' message in full, with all due ceremony. For tradition--
Geralt|Is sacred in Toussaint. All right. Fine.
Palmerin|Most Honorable Geralt, Slayer of Monsters and All Evils Nefarious which Prey on the Defenseless of this World!
Palmerin|Whereas never have you been known to deny help to the innocent nor leave widows and orphans to fates undeserved, answer you now our present summons!
Palmerin|Free us from the Beast which floods our streets with blood and sows panic in the hearts of rich and poor alike!
Palmerin|Come to our aid, witcher - thus humbly beseeches you the star-crossed city's most gracious protectress, Her Illustrious Highness, Duchess Anna Henrietta.
Milton|Shall you answer her call?
Geralt|Might be the most fervent request that I take a contract ever. And the most polite.
Geralt|And now we've got all that behind us, I wanna hear more about this Beast. Some kind of monster? Just guessing.
Palmerin|Most assuredly, though no one has caught a good look at it as yet. Our only sure witnesses - bodies massacred in a brutal, horrid manner.
Milton|Look. Some sketches drafted from descriptions given by those who claim they glimpsed the Beast - each quite different. To my mind, these "witnesses" lie.
Geralt|How many victims so far?
Palmerin|Two. When Her Grace learned of the second, she discharged us immediately to fetch you, promising grants of land and fortunes in gold should you answer her summons.
Milton|An ill wind blows, Geralt. The Beast cannot be tracked - folk say it wields black magic. Also, both victims were nobly born, and the start of a tourney draws near.
Geralt|Ehh, I sometimes think back to all the contracts I've ever taken from sovereigns. Can't name hardly any where I came out ahead.
Palmerin|You cannot be thinking to refuse?!
Geralt|Ahh, no, just struck by a thought - how the duchess can sometimes be, hm… demanding.
Milton|So you accept the contract! Excellent!
Palmerin|We must set off at once. We long wandered this land, searching for you. Yet time is of the essence!
Geralt|Ready to go, soon as you're packed.
Palmerin|Hah! Then posthaste to Toussaint!
Milton|To Toussaint!
Geralt|Toussaint's a long way off. Gotta think if I really want to make the trek.
Palmerin|A minor inconvenience. We had hoped you would agree.
Milton|Geralt, we've no cause to return without you. Should we do so, Her Grace will greet us with gallows. Do you wish to burden your soul with the deaths of two old friends? Return to us soon and accept.
Palmerin|We will await you here. As Milton says, we've no choice.
Geralt|Beast wields black magic? What makes you say so?
Palmerin|The first victim vanished between bites at a feast. Of the feastgoers, none noticed this. They saw but an open window, then heard desperate cries from the street below, where a corpse had just been found.
Milton|The second killing, similar. A knight in a locked room, servants all about the house, guards all around the estate. Yet the Beast somehow got him out, dragged him to the town square and killed him there. No one saw nor heard a thing.
Palmerin|We have no fear of creatures against which sword and shield protect. But of this Beast nothing is known. Save that it cannot be traced, kills effortlessly and with no rhyme or reason we can discern.
Geralt|Anyone tried to hunt it? Knights-errant, for example?
Palmerin|Hah, many have tried - baiting, waiting in ambush, but to no avail.
Milton|The Beast is clever - it evades all traps, and attacks of a sudden. It is like a ghost.
Palmerin|An experienced tracker, this is what we need. With knowledge of monsters. In short, we need you.
Geralt|Mentioned a tourney. Why doesn't the duchess just call it off?
Palmerin|Simply, it is too late. The guests have arrived. The best knights of all lands, relatives of the emperor.
Palmerin|The Beast could be a threat to others, not just to Her Grace's subjects.
Geralt|Got it. Foreign aristocrat dies, at best it's a scandal, at worst - a diplomatic incident.
Geralt|Anna Henrietta really say all that? Word for word?
Milton|Well, in point of fact she said, "Bring me the witcher and dare not spare your horses. Only make certain this time he comes alone."
Milton|The ducal chamberlain added the rest. You know how it is.
Geralt|Yeah, I remember.
Palmerin|I might add, be it unofficially, that a hefty reward awaits. Yet the specifics you will need to verify with Her Illustrious Highness.
Geralt|Peasants'll be fine, Palmerin. Been dealing with bandits for generations.
Palmerin|Your words do little to assuage my sense of morality bruised.
Geralt|Found your message on a notice board.
Verden Peasant 01|We've not got no need for yer help…
Milton|Have no fear, good man. Our labors shall be done quickly, the prowlers to be banished for good.
Palmerin|Milton! Look!
Milton|Geralt!
Geralt|In the flesh.
Milton|Hail, witcher! Let us go inside and greet you as befits an old friend.
Palmerin|And you - fear not. We shall put an end to the rule of outlaws. Soon.
Milton|Geralt! We had scoured all the land for you!
Milton|Come inside, we must chat.
Geralt|Still waiting?
Milton|As I told you - we cannot return empty-handed. It is simply out of the question.
Palmerin|Have you reconsidered? Will you take the offer?
Geralt|Something I need to see to first.
Milton|We shall await you here.
Geralt|So, fess up, what brings you such a long way? Notice mentioned some "Beast"?
Palmerin|We are to deliver Her Grace the Duchess' message in full, with all due ceremony. For tradition--
Geralt|Is sacred in Toussaint. All right. Fine.
Palmerin|Most Honorable Geralt, Slayer of Monsters and All Evils Nefarious which Prey on the Defenseless of this World!
Palmerin|Whereas never have you been known to deny help to the innocent nor leave widows and orphans to fates undeserved, answer you now our present summons!
Palmerin|Free us from the Beast which floods our streets with blood and sows panic in the hearts of rich and poor alike!
Palmerin|Come to our aid, witcher - thus humbly beseeches you the star-crossed city's most gracious protectress, Her Illustrious Highness, Duchess Anna Henrietta.
Milton|Shall you answer her call?
<|endoftext|>
Verden Old Woman 01|They's acomin'!
Geralt|Hear that? Your bandits have arrived.
Milton|Let us go out to greet them.
Verden Bandit 05|Harharhar!
Palmerin|Hark, contemptible curs!
Verden Bandit 02|Hahahaha! He mean us?
Verden Bandit 04|Heheheh! Regular Punch n' Judy, 'ere!
Palmerin|I, Palmerin de Launfal, call upon you to repent! Search your hearts! Do you not see that they are blackened?!
Palmerin|To prey upon commoners is no honor! To loot their meager stores! Abandon the path of shame and we will spare you!
Verden Bandit 01|Right good jest, that. Had us a laugh. Now fuck off, 'fore we lose our patience and you lose somethin' else.
Verden Bandit 02|Nay, wait, Zorg. These lads're a lark. Mayhaps they know some tricks?
Verden Bandit 03|Oi, players! Can you toss balls, all loopedy-like? Or do that thing where one spits fire while the other farts!
Geralt|Noble Palmerin's giving you a chance. Now I'm gonna give you some advice - do what he says.
Verden Bandit 01|Or what?
Geralt|Or you'll find yourself fighting knights-errant in the pay of the duchess of Toussaint. And they eat scum like you with their morning porridge.
Verden Bandit 03|There's three of 'em. Two turtled up in armor. We'll come back later.
Verden Bandit 01|Some wench sent them! Folk'll say we's afeared o' wenches and jesters.
Geralt|Oooh - insulted the duchess. Not good.
Milton|Indeed, we cannot let the affront go unpunished. I swear upon the heron you will pay with your own blood!
Palmerin|By the crane! Villains, ready your arms!
Geralt|Seems to me they're unmoved.
Milton|You tried, my friend.
Palmerin|We've talked enough! I challenge you all to combat! By my honor! For Toussaint!
Milton|For Beauclair! By the crane, defend yourselves, harlotsbroods!
<|endoftext|>
Guillaume|The river surrendered a corpse. It washed up in the meander by the Cockatrice. Damien de la Tour's guardsmen are there already, securing the area.
Geralt|"Securing the area"? Better go there now, before they trample any tracks, manhandle any evidence.
Palmerin|Set forth, then. I shall ride for the city to inform Her Gracious Magnificence that Geralt has arrived. We'll meet later, near Guillaume's tent at the tourney grounds. I shall take you then to see Her Grace.
Geralt|Big beast. Tackling it single-handed? None too wise.
Milton|Neither is love born of wisdom, witcher. So, Guillaume, out with it - which fair damsel inspired you to vow to kill that filth?
Guillaume|The most beautiful among them.
Palmerin|If he wishes to guard her name a secret, he need not reveal it.
Guillaume|You I do not know, sir, nor seem you a knight, yet still I am profoundly grateful, nay, indebted to you for your succor. This trophy, sir, is yours.
Geralt|I'll take the trophy, why not. Could find someone who'll pay to buy it.
Geralt|Put up a good fight against the giant. Got experience battling monsters?
Guillaume|None. In Toussaint, we mostly chase bandits. But I vowed I'd bring my heart's champion the head of a monstrosity. As the famed Gottfried, known as the Giantkiller, did.
Milton|You don't mean to hunt the Beast, I hope? The matter's best left to Geralt.
Guillaume|Another challenge awaits me. Yet if Geralt is to hunt the Beast, he ought to know - it's struck again.
Geralt|A giant this close to human settlements? Strange.
Guillaume|That was no ordinary giant - his name was Golyat. Rumored to have been a knight once, but one who broke his vows. For this, the Lady of the Lake transformed him into a wild giant and banished him into the Gorgon Hills.
Geralt|So he came back down? Why?
Milton|Several times each year hunger chased him into the lowlands. Golyat had killed and devoured many shepherds. Guillaume's hunt served a noble cause.
Milton|At any rate, it's a tale for more agreeable environs.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Notice anything interesting?
Milton|Alas, nothing.
Milton|No one here. They must have removed the body already.
Geralt|Let's look around, see if we can't find something interesting.
Geralt|Can't get used to the way you knights talk.
Geralt|Especially how you switch back and forth between flowery and, well, near normal.
Milton|We are knights-errant in the service of Her Gracious Magnificence.
Milton|When we appear in her name or speak on her behalf, we are bound by tradition.
Geralt|Brave kid, Guillaume.
Milton|Palmerin oversaw his upbringing. Guillaume is his kin.
Milton|No one here. They must have removed the body already.
Geralt|Let's look around, make sure they didn't miss anything.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|One thing - found a handkerchief in the water. Monogrammed "d.l.C." Mean anything to you?
Milton|De la Croix?! It cannot be. Was it he the Beast slew?!
Geralt|Seems so. Knew him well?
Milton|Long past. We were close friends, once, but our paths diverged. He was a man of extremes, standing by his companions no matter the odds, fighting his foes to the bitter end.
Geralt|Foes - he have a lot of them?
Milton|He did, but I do not see what that has to do with the Beast. Ah, Geralt, you've struck a raw nerve. Memories of a time long past to which I'd rather not return now.
Geralt|I understand. We can talk later. Let's go to the tavern.
Geralt|Seems we've got ourselves an audience.
Milton|You think this surprising? The locals will tell the children of children they do not have yet of the day a quartered corpse was pulled from the river.
Milton|What now?
Geralt|We know this isn't the site of the murder. Current brought the body here. Corpse got caught in the nets. Guardsmen pulled it out, put it in a boat and took it somewhere.
Geralt|I'd like to look at it before it starts to decompose.
Milton|The inn - its patrons must have seen the guardsmen, which direction they took. We should ask there.
Geralt|Look, a boat was launched here. Guardsmen must've loaded the body parts onto it, taken them somewhere.
Geralt|Need to find out where. I'd like to look at the corpse before it starts to decompose.
Milton|The inn - its patrons must have seen the guardsmen, which direction they took. We should ask there.
Milton|What now?
Geralt|This isn't the site of the murder, we know that. Current brought the body here. Corpse got caught in the nets. Guardsmen pulled it out, put it in a boat and took it somewhere.
Geralt|Need to find out where. I'd like to look at the corpse before it starts to decompose.
Milton|The inn - its patrons must have seen the guardsmen, which direction they took. We should ask there.
Geralt|Guardsmen snipped these nets to untangle the body. Which must've been quartered or chopped up somehow, given how much blood there is.
Geralt|Body parts were put on a boat, taken somewhere. Need to find out where. I'd like to look at the corpse before it starts to decompose.
Milton|The inn - its patrons must have seen the guardsmen, which direction they took. We should ask there.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Silk kerchief, monogrammed d.l.C. A noble's accessory, clearly.
Milton|A watering hole for traders, smugglers, boatmen. But you will find no better crayfish chowder in all Toussaint.
Geralt|Anything taken by the current ends up in these shallows.
Milton|Yes. The stench is fierce.
Geralt|Junk that came down the river.
Milton|We must keep searching.
Geralt|Junk, junk and more junk.
Geralt|Drawn here by the smell of blood. Let's keep looking.
Geralt|Got guests! Careful!
Geralt|Nets were attached here.
Milton|The trail ends. What now?
Geralt|Now we go wading.
Geralt|Here, look.
Milton|Indeed.
Geralt|Pulled the body out of the water here. Must've floated downstream, got caught in the nets.
Geralt|I'll dive in, see if the guardsmen missed anything.
Geralt|Wheel ruts. Guardsmen must've transferred the body from the boat onto a cart or wagon.
Geralt|Trail's muddled from here. Got nothing we can follow.
Geralt|Blood traces on the bottom. And a boathook.
Geralt|Body pulled from the river was transported using this boat.
Geralt|Only blood-soaked scraps left of the victim's clothing. Good quality cloth.
Milton|A wealthy victim, correct?
Geralt|Looks it.
Milton|I find it hard to discern anything in this muck.
Geralt|Be nice to know where they took the corpse.
Geralt|Footprints, see them? And a rut made by the hull of a boat. Left recently, I'd say.
Geralt|Look at the rut - guardsmen left this site by boat, recently.
Geralt|Probably to transport the body somewhere.
Geralt|Blood… Guardsmen pulled these nets out of the water, then cut the mutilated body free.
Geralt|Gonna dive in. Make sure they didn't miss anything.
Geralt|Dragged some nets onto the bank, then cut them to untangle them. Lot of blood, so the corpse must've been cut up, quartered, maybe.
Milton|It's likely they loaded the body parts onto a boat and sailed off.
Geralt|Mhm. Gonna dive in, check the other nets.
Geralt|Hobnailed boots, multiple sets of prints. Ducal Guard, clearly - let's see where they went.
Geralt|Need to comb the bank.
Geralt|Walked along the shoreline.
Milton|Perhaps the body lay on the bank.
<|endoftext|>
Milton|By my troth! Could that be the musty scent of fresh pâté?
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Naught else, Sir de Peyrac-Peyran. I see time has not dulled your senses.
Beauclair Banker Man 02|We would be honored if you would join us. Your companion as well.
Milton|But why do I not detect even a whiff of crayfish chowder?
Toussaint Sailor 03|No soup today, on account of there being no crayfish. I reckon you've not heard, but all I caught was a corpse! I awoke at the crack of dawn, as I do each day, but when I looked up, I beheld a blood red sky…
Milton|This corpse is precisely why we're here. For the man whom you've invited to join you at the table was summoned from a far-off land by Her Gracious Magnificence. He is tasked with tracking and killing the Beast.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|We invited two men to join us, yet since Sir de Peyrac-Peyran in temperament is more akin to hare than hound, I surmise the other is the hunter. With whom do we have the pleasure?
Geralt|Name's Geralt.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|A humble introduction. You've clearly not tarried long with Sir de Peyrac-Peyran.
Milton|Spare us the petty insults. Geralt is a master of the witchering trade. He has questions concerning the Beast's last victim.
Toussaint Sailor 03|I was the one to find the corpse. The sun had just risen when I awoke, sat straight up in my bed, looked out the window and beheld a sky red as blood--
Milton|Ask, Geralt, please. Or we shall be here till winter.
Geralt|Need to examine the body. Know where they took it?
Toussaint Sailor 03|They ferried it across, then loaded it on a cart and hauled it to a cellar at Corvo Bianco. To keep it cool, see.
Milton|What? Why, Corvo Bianco is Baron Rossell's estate! When he learns they've turned his cellar into a morgue, he'll set his hounds on them!
Beauclair Banker Man 02|While you were gallivanting about the North, his vineyard was auctioned off.
Geralt|Who was that? Woman who just left? Didn't see her before, didn't notice her walk in, either.
Milton|Doubtless Linnice - the innkeep's daughter. But hold, Geralt, because this is an outrage. Rossell's vineyard was auctioned off?! Inconceivable!
Beauclair Banker Man 02|It is no secret the baron had gambling debts up to his ears. It finally came time to collect - his creditors auctioned off his property. The Ducal Chancellery bought it, in fact. Rossell now bunks with his brother in Vicovaro.
Milton|I told Rossell he'd get his comeuppance. How long can one draw on past heroics?! His creditors must finally have divined that his promises meant nothing.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Such are the times. Today's knights are pale shadows of the heroes of yore.
Toussaint Sailor 03|It's true what they say - gods sent the Beast to punish us for straying from the old paths!
Geralt|Thanks for the hospitality. Time I examined the corpse.
Milton|Corvo Bianco lies a short way from here, near the tourney grounds. Just follow the road and you'll arrive.
Geralt|Not coming with…? Oh yeah, duty of some sort calls.
Milton|"Some sort" - hah! Her Grace bestowed a great honor on me even before we departed for Velen. I'm to play the Hare during this year's game in the palace gardens. When you see me in my costume, you will wet yourself laughing!
Geralt|A little tempted to ask a few questions, but it sounds like a long, complicated story. One involving lengthy digressions into local history and tradition… So, see you later, Milton. And good luck.
Geralt|So folk think the Beast's divine punishment.
Toussaint Sailor 03|Knights have turned their backs on the old customs. Where they were defenders of the duchy, they're now defenders of their own tushes…
Milton|Why, you insolent…!
Geralt|Let him talk.
Toussaint Sailor 03|The duchess trades in titles, grants honors to ill-doers. We've strayed from the path of virtue, lost the gods' favor, so the gods sent retribution.
Milton|Don't listen to that nonsense, Geralt. It's rehashed street preacher codswallop.
Beauclair Banker Man 02|Yes, the rabble-rousers have been sprouting up like weeds lately. Each offering the same bill of goods.
Geralt|They say anything else about the Beast? Besides it being a messenger of the gods.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|The Toussaintois are no fools. They see clearly the Beast kills on days honoring patron saints.
Geralt|Picky monster.
Geralt|Must've been early in the morning. Went to check your nets and then…?
Toussaint Sailor 03|I stepped out of my hut and saw…
Milton|By my troth! To the point, man! You found a body ensnared in your crayfish nets. We know this already. What happened then?!
Milton|Did you see anyone nearby? Did you spy anything noteworthy? Anything at all?
Toussaint Sailor 03|Not a soul around, just me. As for noteworthy… hmm… well…
Milton|What did you see? But be warned - if I hear the sky was red again…
Toussaint Sailor 03|I saw… a head, bobbing - eyes bulging, the tongue blue and popped out. Next to it, a hand rocking upon the water.
Geralt|Get a good look at the body parts?
Toussaint Sailor 03|They gave me such a fright, I bolted to town fast as my legs would take me, then returned with guardsmen who told me to keep out of their way.
Toussaint Sailor 03|They had a hard haul. The parts were so tangled up in my nets, they were forced to cut them.
Geralt|Like Milton said, I've come from the North at the duchess' behest to deal with the Beast.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Yes, yes, but who are you? A knight? A mercenary? A soldier?
Milton|Geralt is a witcher, a master of his trade. He has questions for you about the Beast's most recent victim.
Milton|I shall be off once I finish my pâté.
Beauclair Banker Man 02|A well-composed pâté, I must admit.
Toussaint Sailor 03|I'd rather have that chowder.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|The cook has worked wonders, as always.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Dammit…
Geralt|Killer must still be here.
Geralt|Claw wounds. From five separate claws, spread of a small human hand.
Geralt|Footprints. Small, bare feet. Lead deeper into the cellar.
Geralt|Woman from the inn was wearing this coat.
Geralt|Fell down the stairs, broke his neck.
Geralt|Hurled against the wall with great force.
Geralt|Used this to batter down the grate…
Geralt|Sounds of a fight. Have to hurry.
Geralt|Took a lot of strength to batter this down.
Geralt|Killed with a single blow.
Geralt|Massacred. By a vampire. Not an ekimmara, though. Or a fleder.
Geralt|Bruxa. Gotta be.
Geralt|Attacker had no trouble knocking over the cart.
Geralt|Busted ribs, blood from the ears - took a solid hit…
Geralt|Throat torn open by man-like jaws.
Geralt|Man-like except for long fangs.
Geralt|Need to hurry.
Geralt|In the cellar, gotta be…
Geralt|River muck. Carried the body in this cart.
Geralt|Need to hurry.
Geralt|Black Blood and Moon Dust - could be lifesavers.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Ugh. Stinks.
Geralt|Water-logged, both hands amputated. Body was quartered, just as I thought.
Geralt|So, murderer was clearly a monster, but not a bruxa.
Geralt|But then why'd the bruxa come here for the severed hand? And who does the hand belong to? Why the hell's it still warm?
Geralt|Now, pouch shoved down the victim's throat - what's the significance? And why was he chopped up into pieces?
Geralt|Lots of questions, no answers so far. Need to know about the other victims. I'll ask Palmerin to get me in to see the duchess.
Geralt|Laid in water for some time. Head's swollen, and something took a few bites out of it.
Geralt|Hm. Something in the throat.
Geralt|A pouch. Bulging with coins.
Geralt|Nilfgaardian florens… from several different provinces.
Geralt|If the murderer did this, means we're dealing with a sentient, thinking beast.
Geralt|Nothing interesting besides the purse in his throat.
Geralt|Body was chopped up after death.
Geralt|Blows struck with great force, but bones sliced through, not crushed.
Geralt|Creature that killed him had long claws, sharp as a witcher's blade. First sank its claws into the victim's heart.
Geralt|No bruxa did this.
Geralt|Third hand. A spare? Except it's clearly not the victim's. Guardsmen must've not noticed it as they picked everything up.
Geralt|How's this possible? Still warm. Blood's still flowing?
Geralt|Several monster species can regenerate. Never heard of that happening to their severed limbs, though. Or of their limbs seeming completely alive after so much time.
Geralt|Examine the tissue more closely later. Might learn something.
Geralt|Both arms separated from the torso.
Geralt|Hm. Seems the bruxa was placing a third hand in her bag…
Geralt|Hand from the bag didn't belong to this victim.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Need to speak to the duchess. Urgently.
Palmerin|All right, you scamps. Story's done. Go find your parents.
Toussaint Boy 02|But Sir Palmerin! What about the story of Riddick and the dragon?
Palmerin|That tale's for another time. But take a good look at the man who stands before you now. This is Geralt of Rivia, the master witcher who lent his valiant hand to the defeat of the giant Golyat.
Toussaint Girl 01|Master witcher, is it true virtue always trumps villainy?
Geralt|Ahem, yeah, virtue always wins.
Toussaint Boy 02|But the Black Knight, he's a villain, and he wins.
Toussaint Boy 03|The Cutter of Casteldaccia, too.
Geralt|Moral victory - that's what counts.
Toussaint Girl 01|Rubbish.
Palmerin|Now, that will do for questions. Go find your parents.
Palmerin|Her Enlightened Highness has doubtless arrived at the tourney grounds to watch the battle in the arena. If we hurry, we'll be in time to speak with her before the spectacle begins.
Geralt|Lead the way.
Geralt|Who's fighting? Nilfgaardian gladiators?
Palmerin|Close, but not quite. As you will soon see.
Geralt|Someone's gonna fight a shaelmaar? With only some bells on its tail to confuse it, slow it down?
Palmerin|Whatever is the problem? The beast is a gift, from the emperor, no less.
Geralt|This is dangerous. Bells on its tail aren't enough.
Palmerin|I saw a spectacle of this sort at the arena in Neunreuth. There, a knight defeated a shaelmaar with bells on its tail.
Geralt|Might've gotten lucky, shaelmaar might've been lame, who knows? Only a witcher has a real chance against a healthy shaelmaar. And that's not even every witcher.
Geralt|Sides which, releasing a monster that dangerous in front of a crowd? Plain irresponsible.
Geralt|Let's go.
Guillaume|I dedicate my imminent victory to fair Lady Vivienne!
Palmerin|It's begun. The fight shall have to end first. We must wait.
Geralt|Got a bad feeling about this.
Geralt|Dammit.
Geralt|We have to help him.
Palmerin|Ooph.
Geralt|Who's going to fight the beast?
Palmerin|Guillaume - the young man you met.
Geralt|Yeah, mentioned he'd promised his heart's captor a monster trophy.
Palmerin|Great love demands great sacrifices.
Geralt|Shouldn't torment the beast. How would you like to be dumped in an arena, blindfolded, with a string of bells dangling from your ass?
Palmerin|Pity a monster? You? A witcher?
Geralt|I slay monsters who are a threat to humans. You're out to humiliate one to entertain a crowd.
Geralt|No knight'll gain any glory from this.
Geralt|Sure hope you know what you're doing.
Palmerin|Master beast-tamers from Nilfgaard's arenas will ensure the shaelmaar is dazed. And that is sure to delight the crowd.
Geralt|Shaelmaars're damned dangerous, even young ones. Need to be careful.
Geralt|Much as we might not like it, virtue's got nothing to do with it. Victory goes to the stronger.
Toussaint Boy 03|So… is there no point to being virtuous?
Geralt|Not what I said.
Toussaint Boy 02|Then what's needed to vanquish villains?
Geralt|A sharp sword. And some skill.
Toussaint Girl 01|But what if there's lots of villains and they've sharp swords, too? And lots of skill?
Geralt|That's where virtue starts to matter. 'Cause they say the gods reward the virtuous after death.
Geralt|Not always. Could go either way. Sometimes virtue wins, sometimes villainy gets the upper hand.
Geralt|Still worth being good.
Toussaint Girl 01|But why, if it doesn't mean you'll win?
Geralt|Palmerin's story - think back. A decent man attracts other good folk, makes friends he can count on. A rogue, well, he can only count on other rogues.
Geralt|And who would you rather have for a friend?
Toussaint Boy 03|A man of virtue?
Palmerin|I must agree.
Palmerin|Then the giant belched forth a roar so horrid, it shook all the birds from the trees!
Toussaint Boy 02|Then what?!
Palmerin|It hurled the millstone at the knights.
Toussaint Girl 01|Oh my!
Palmerin|But virtue always trumps villainy.
Palmerin|With his friends at his side, Guillaume bested Golyat and restored peace to the land.
Geralt|It's late, I know, sorry to bother you. But I need to talk to the duchess.
Palmerin|It's no trouble. I had not yet laid my head to rest. As to Her Illustrious Highness, I fear you will have to wait until the sun has risen again.
Palmerin|Make yourself at home. Milton mentioned you'd been to Corvo Bianco to see the Beast's victim. Learn anything new from the body?
Geralt|Well, since we have to wait anyway, steel yourself for a long story…
Palmerin|And how is it we passed from your account of the investigation to reminiscing about the succubus?
Geralt|Cause those were good times. And we were younger. Always nice to talk about that. Look - sun's up.
Palmerin|Then let's tarry no more. Her Enlightened Highness is sure to have arrived at the tourney grounds by now. Let us go.
Geralt|I'd like the duchess to hear what I have to say.
Palmerin|We cannot disturb her at this hour.
<|endoftext|>
Le Papillon|Out, out, brief flame! And thus the witcher's life was snuffed. All our hopes, alas, had turned to dust.
Le Papillon|Drink up the ocean and set fire to the wood! For nothing in this struggle can come to any good!
Le Papillon|Woe to us all if the monster's the victor! Then naught shall have come of valor and vigor!
Le Papillon|Our hero's struck deep by the shaelmaar's red claws! Soon the witcher shall perish in cavernous maws!
Le Papillon|The fate of the beast has been weighed by the gods! Soon the witcher shall triumph, against all odds!
Le Papillon|The witcher waited, till the time was true, then twirled, danced and spun - struck the monster right through!
Le Papillon|Like a beau who leaves after love's first spurt, so the witcher wooed the shaelmaar, then its foul heart hurt!
Le Papillon|Dodge, dive, flee, feint! His razor strikes belly! Shaelmaar's cries ring aloud, blood transforms into jelly!
Le Papillon|Alas! Poor knightling! The beast heaved its foul girth,
Le Papillon|Let loose a roar and knocked him to earth!
Le Papillon|Then down came the witcher in one mighty bound, to give fight to the beast, its plans confound!
Le Papillon|Alas! Palmerin lies prostrate, he has breathed his last breath!
Le Papillon|Avenge him, witcher! Fight bravely, unto death!
Palmerin|For honor! Onward!
Geralt|Gotta keep it down!
Geralt|Can only tell where we are when it hears us!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|I examined the body of the Beast's last victim. Might've found something, need to analyze it. A quiet place - that's what I could use most right now. And maybe the help of an alchemist or a mage.
Geralt|Also like to hear all you know about the previous victims. Take it Sir de la Tour's my man for that?
Damien|Firstly, call me Damien, please. Secondly, you should know I spoke against summoning you here.
Damien|I've heard much about you. You bring trouble, or thus far have, always. And we've enough trouble as it is. Yet we are capable of defeating the Beast on our own, without an outsider's help. I've no doubt about it.
Anna Henrietta|Damien, we settled the matter of the witcher's employ some time past. Definitively. Since you have broached it nonetheless, let us discuss Geralt's pay.
Anna Henrietta|Are the legends true? Do witchers usually demand "that which you find at home, yet did not expect"?
Geralt|Yes, Your Grace. The Law of Surprise. Time-honored.
Anna Henrietta|Hm, we shall be candid. The surprises we encounter on a daily basis would be of no value to one such as you.
Anna Henrietta|What awaits at the palace are edicts to sign and portraits of suitors from far-off lands. I fear you would find little use for either.
Anna Henrietta|Thus we've decided you shall receive the deed to a vineyard, Corvo Bianco, and a sum of coin. You will doubtless consider this adequate.
Anna Henrietta|Title to the vineyard shall be given to you at once - surely you'll need lodgings while you hunt. The coin, however, will be yours only once you have slain the Beast.
Geralt|Lovely, generous gesture, Your Grace. But, uh, Corvo Bianco - isn't it the duchy's temporary morgue?
Anna Henrietta|Is it, now? The chancellery's bungled things again, we fear! Not to be left unsupervised for one instant!
Anna Henrietta|Yet in its mood a morgue should present minimal problems to a witcher. What’s more, nothing enhances a wine's reputation better than a grim legend.
Geralt|Thank you, Your Grace. I accept the contract, of course. But as I said before, I'll need some information.
Geralt|Lots of similarities between the victims. All the bodies were found in strange places, under extraordinary circumstances. Seems the murderer, whoever or whatever it is, has some meaning to convey.
Anna Henrietta|These were honorable men. We are horrified by the disdain, the disrespect with which they were treated. These were knights of Toussaint, blast it!
Geralt|Might be the point. From what you say, none was a model of virtue. Ever considered that's what the Beast's trying to draw attention to?
Anna Henrietta|All the murdered men were knights who swore fealty to the five chivalric virtues. And even if th--
Geralt|Knights of Toussaint swear fealty to what virtues, exactly?
Anna Henrietta|Honor, wisdom, generosity, valor, and compassion.
Geralt|Beast seems to be pointing up moral decay, denouncing it. Victims were all humiliated. Might've been murdered to emphasize their lack of specific chivalric virtues.
Damien|Honor compromised by the pillory, wisdom by ridicule, generosity by a coin pouch shoved down a throat… It seems to fit, true, though not perfectly.
Geralt|Can't discount the theory if it's on the lips of everyone in town. Say our reasoning's right - next murder'll be just as showy and denounce the victim's lack of the fourth virtue - valor. We can also assume that victim'll be an elder knight.
Anna Henrietta|Let's think… At the moment, all the knights are either at the tourney grounds or in the palace gardens. Our annual Hare Hunt shall begin there shortly. Have you heard of the custom?
Geralt|Milton mentioned something. Seemed excited to prance around in a bunny costume, not sure why.
Geralt|Hang on… Strange circumstances, a knight advanced in years, the famed cowardice of rabbits…
Anna Henrietta|Could it be that simple? Is Milton de Peyrac-Peyran the next victim?
Geralt|Milton also knew de la Croix. Told me so, down by the river.
Anna Henrietta|Damien! To miss something so obvious! De Peyrac-Peyran, Crespi, de la Croix and du Lac formed a knightly team! It was years ago, but…
Geralt|Your Grace, we need to find Milton. Immediately.
Anna Henrietta|Rather problematic. You see, the garden entertainments are due to start, and he's disguised as the Hare, hiding somewhere, waiting for some tipsy courtiers to find him. The Hare's hiding place is a carefully-guarded secret.
Damien|We must call off the game, at once!
Anna Henrietta|First and foremost, we must remain calm.
Anna Henrietta|Damien, order the gardens searched, immediately but discreetly. By no means can we disrupt the festivities. Panic will only incite the Beast to strike sooner.
Anna Henrietta|And you, witcher, follow me! My gardens, my knight, I shall take the fore.
Anna Henrietta|A murder is out of the question. I will not allow it! Not near my palace!
Anna Henrietta|Horses! Ready our horses!
Toussaint Noble Woman 02|Your Grace!
Toussaint Noble Woman 03|Ah!
Beauclair Palace Servant Man 01|What the hell?! Why, I shall--
Beauclair Palace Servant Man 01|Your Highness! I…
Anna Henrietta|Mind it doesn't get wrinkled.
Anna Henrietta|Onward!
Toussaint Noble Woman 02|Hey!
Toussaint Noble Woman 02|That is silk! Be careful!
Toussaint Noble Woman 02|Give it to me!
Beauclair Palace Servant Man 01|Agh…
Geralt|They were a team?
Anna Henrietta|They were close friends, tightly knit. And as such earned the trust of our father, the duke. We often witnessed him turn to them with delicate matters. Later, their paths diverged.
Geralt|Unlikely to be a coincidence. Beast must know it, too. It's a lead, I'm sure.
Geralt|Five virtues - why're they so important to your knights?
Anna Henrietta|Strange question.
Geralt|Your Grace, forgive me. I'm a foreigner trying to understand another land's customs.
Anna Henrietta|You are forgiven. According to legend the virtues we cultivate were bestowed upon us by the Lady of the Lake. How we truly came to espouse them, none remember.
Anna Henrietta|In Toussaint we believe men of low birth should be simple-hearted and obedient. We expect much more, however, of our knights. They are to be soldiers and courtiers, lords and servants. Thus the need for clear moral guidelines.
Anna Henrietta|At the time of his dubbing, a knight vows to demonstrate, throughout his life, honor, wisdom, generosity, valor and compassion.
Geralt|So, first two victims were knights, best years behind them.
Damien|The same could be said of the third. Sir de la Croix was wont to claim that in modern times knights face new challenges, enterprise being the latest addition to the chivalric virtues.
Anna Henrietta|He made a veritable fortune in the grain trade. Palmerin even nicknamed him Sir de la Stingy.
Geralt|Found a coin pouch on his body. Contained florens, dating from various times, hailing from different provinces of the empire.
Damien|De la Croix loved coin, true, but had no patience for numismatics.
Geralt|How'd it start? Who was the first victim?
Damien|Crespi was the first to die. He was famed once for his many glorious tournament victories. Then he grew old, hung up his sword and took to wine making.
Anna Henrietta|Crespi was not loved by the wine merchants - he was ruthless in business and thought to cheat many a time. He asked us for a dispensation from all court ceremonies. We did not grant it, we could not. Once you've taken the oath of a knight, you remain a knight till death.
Geralt|How'd he die? Where'd they find the body?
Damien|Quite unusual, the circumstance. He was at a feast when suddenly one of his fellow feast goers noticed he was missing. The Town Watch found him an hour later - on his hands and knees, propped against the town pillory, his sword hanging from his neck.
Damien|He had died of wounds inflicted with claws, not a weapon. Blows of great force.
Geralt|So he died suddenly - but the body was on its knees. Meaning someone posed it.
Damien|So it seems.
Geralt|Second murder - tell me what you know.
Damien|In the city there are certain nooks, no one reasonable ventures there after dark. Ramon du Lac's corpse was found in one such place.
Damien|With the first murder, terror gripped the city. Its inhabitants grew wary, kept to safe areas. Consequently, news of the second victim came to us from a group of concerned… cutpurses.
Geralt|Criminals fear the Beast? Telling, in a way. Take it you've excluded the possibility that Ramon died at the hands of these bandits.
Damien|Do you believe me an amateur? Not hands, but claws killed Ramon du Lac. The wound was deep, clean.
Anna Henrietta|His body was found in the gutter, dressed in nightshirt and cap, a pillow placed under his head and his sword replaced by a bed warmer. Ramon du Lac! A knight who but a dozen years past was an advisor to our father, the duke.
Geralt|Someone went to a lot of trouble to make him look ridiculous. Maybe revenge was the motive?
Damien|It's not out of the question. Du Lac had shady dealings with the criminal underworld, but no one ever came forth with concrete proof of any misdoings.
Geralt|No, Your Grace. Usually we just ask for gold.
Anna Henrietta|The response we expected.
Geralt|Not quite, Your Grace. Law of Surprise… it's something we invoke at times, but rarely. Usually we just take gold.
Anna Henrietta|Disappointing. This "law" sounds rather romantic. On the other hand, on returning to the palace we would likely find impatient petitioners or a set of sample fabrics for a new dress. Poor rewards, both.
Anna Henrietta|I fear you'd not have much use for any of the surprises we are likely to come upon.
Anna Henrietta|Geralt! Magnificent! Breathtaking!
Geralt|Your Grace…
Anna Henrietta|We knew that to summon you was a brilliant idea! We are delighted, ravished, to have struck upon it.
Geralt|And I'm truly… uhh, honored…
Anna Henrietta|See to our young hero - hop hop! For we must make off with Geralt. We should talk.
Anna Henrietta|We had been long awaiting your arrival, had nearly lost hope. Then suddenly - that entrance! So spectacular!
Geralt|Your Grace, my contract - I'd like to discuss it.
Anna Henrietta|Naturally. But not here.
Anna Henrietta|We shall need Damien. He led the investigation pending your arrival. But wherever could he be? Come, we must find him.
Anna Henrietta|Tell us, have you come alone, or did Viscount Julian accompany you?
Geralt|Wish to see Dandelion, Your Grace?
Anna Henrietta|Yes! I mean, no! Ugh. Yes. But solely to tell him we regret - yes, deeply regret - rescinding the death sentence we so justly handed down upon him.
Anna Henrietta|If we could turn back time, we would make certain he sat in a tower till he rotted - no, we would ensure he was broken on the wheel, then drawn, hanged and quartered!
Anna Henrietta|Ah! The very man we would entrust with these tasks - Damien de la Tour, captain of my personal guard.
Damien|Your Grace. Witcher.
Geralt|Greetings.
Geralt|Sorry to have to tell you, but the guardsmen handling the last victim's body--
Damien|I know already. The creature in the cellar of Corvo Bianco - was it the Beast?
Geralt|No, a bruxa, a kind of vampire. Not the Beast, but tied to it in some way.
Damien|You know this how?
Geralt|Through careful analysis of the evidence, both on the riverbank and at Corvo Bianco.
Damien|Do you mean to insinuate the investigation thus far has been sloppy?
Anna Henrietta|Geralt insinuates nothing of the sort. We must listen to him attentively.
Geralt|Your Grace, shaelmaars're dangerous creatures, even to knights in full plate armor.
Anna Henrietta|Nonsense. In Toussaint, knights have battled beasts for mere glory since time immemorial. True, Guillaume suffered a few bumps, scars and bruises, but in return gained eternal glory as he who slew the monster.
Geralt|Mhm. What about the crowd? Say the shaelmaar had vaulted into the stands. Would've been a massacre.
Anna Henrietta|Geralt, though we value your fortuitous intervention in the arena, we would remind you your services have been retained, and, as shall soon become clear, you will be generously compensated - for completing another task altogether.
Geralt|Guillaume?
Palmerin|The lad came damned close to dying.
Guillaume|I'm… fine… not hurt at all… Vivienne…?
Palmerin|Smile as befits a hero and keep silent. Speech clearly pains you. She approaches.
Guillaume|Geralt… We must… talk… Vivienne…
Palmerin|You shall talk later. In the medics' tent.
Le Papillon|The shaelmaar lies defeated by Geralt of Rivia, master of the witchering trade! Behold as the last gasps of life seep from the beast!
Anna Henrietta|Master Geralt, do what you must! Finish the deed!
Geralt|It's suffered enough.
Le Papillon|The monster lies slain! The fight is done! Praised be the victors!
Palmerin|Forgive me. I am not as nimble as in my younger years.
Geralt|You fought bravely. Thanks for your help.
Geralt|Monster's no threat! No need to kill it!
Le Papillon|A victor may always show mercy! It is his right! Long live Geralt the Merciful!
Le Papillon|Pikemen, see to the beast!

Toussaint Poor Man 03|Did you see?! Who it was?!
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Step aside!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|Aaaa!
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|Gods!
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|Anarietta!
Toussaint Boy 01|Hahaha… The duchess wears no dress!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Don't look, child!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 02|Our Lady, the Duchess!
Toussaint Boy 01|A witcher!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Indeed!
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Was that truly her?!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|What, no dress?
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|Perhaps he pursues her?!

Anna Henrietta|Faster, Geralt! Ride like the wind!
Anna Henrietta|This way! Through town!
Anna Henrietta|Try not to lose your way!
Anna Henrietta|It's not far now!
Geralt|Which way?!
Anna Henrietta|Right, then up the hill!
Geralt|Your Grace…!
Anna Henrietta|Fret not and feed the gossips! Hahah!
Anna Henrietta|Clear a path!
Anna Henrietta|Clear the way, I said!
Anna Henrietta|It's here, just round the corner!
Geralt|Hurry!
Anna Henrietta|You got lost!
Geralt|Sorry.
Anna Henrietta|Sharp right! Take care!
Anna Henrietta|Now across the bridge!
Geralt|Your Grace seems right at home in the saddle!

Toussaint Old Man 01|If one were to call a State courageous or cowardly, what other part of the State would one have in mind if not that which fights and goes to war on the State's behalf?
Toussaint Noble Man 01|No one would ever think of any other.
Toussaint Old Man 01|For the State is courageous in virtue of a portion of itself which preserves the instilled opinion about the nature of things to be feared and not to be feared in pleasure or in pain, under the influence of desire or fear.
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|Yet how might we relate this to knights?
Toussaint Old Man 01|When Her Grace the Duchess knights a man, she does so to cause him gracefully to follow the laws of the State and of knighthood.
Toussaint Old Man 01|And to do so with a conviction as to what is to be feared and not to be feared, and allow nothing to obscure this conviction - not pleasure, not pain, not desire, not dread.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|In olden times, folk would augur from the manner in which peacocks pecked at grain.
Toussaint Noble Woman 02|Don't you mean hens?
Toussaint Noble Woman 03|The common folk used hens, perhaps. Nobles augured from peacocks.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|In any case, for those who wish to see their fortune, there's more grain on the table.
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 04|Behold the leopard from far-away Zerrikania. A predator wild, blood-thirsty and ferocious!
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 04|Beauty and grace embodied in murderous form! Like nothing else!
Toussaint Noble Man 11|A splendid beast!
Toussaint Noble Woman 11|So fierce!
Beauclair Palace Servant Man 01|Fiorano of the 1290 vintage. I do encourage you to try it.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Let us, my Lady, roll our strength and all<br>Our sweetness up into one ball,
Toussaint Noble Man 03|And tear our pleasures with rough strife,<br>Through the iron gates of life.
Toussaint Noble Woman 12|Words of such beauty, I am transported…
Toussaint Noble Man 01|A wonderful mind, knowledge so deep!
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|I must say I feel quite enriched and enlightened.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|They seem to have lost their appetite.
Toussaint Noble Woman 02|Such noble birds, the noblest.
Toussaint Noble Woman 03|They truly do adorn the palace gardens.
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 04|Behold the focused, fearful symmetry!
Toussaint Noble Man 11|It has the gaze of the Beast, of that I'm sure.
Toussaint Noble Woman 11|Focused, fearful symmetry…
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Why, the impertinence!
Toussaint Noble Woman 12|I beg your pardon!
Toussaint Old Man 01|True courage is not that which the broad population sees it to be.
Beauclair Palace Servant Man 01|Smoky accents of marked intensity, adorned with the aromas of an array of jams.
Beauclair Palace Servant Man 02|The flavor is strongly peppery, enhanced upon the tongue by clear chocolate and cherry notes.
Beauclair Palace Servant Man 03|A great wine. With notes of tree bark and detritus, possessing distinct smoky accents. Essential to try.
Beauclair Palace Servant Man 01|You'd like a taste, perhaps? Est Est, an old vintage.
Beauclair Palace Servant Man 02|An excellent wine, the excellent selection of His Excellency Ambassador von Hinn. Please help yourselves!
Beauclair Palace Servant Man 03|A thoroughbred Cabernet from the legendary 1288 vintage. You must try it.
Toussaint Noble Woman 02|They seem to like his seeds.
Toussaint Noble Woman 03|I wonder what a soothsayer would say to that?
Toussaint Noble Man 02|It seems an ill omen to me.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Noble Man 01|But my dear…
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|I refuse! There are insects everywhere! And I shall soil my dress!
Toussaint Noble Man 02|We must win!
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|We must no such thing!
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Bear with me, darling. Just a bit longer.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Have you noticed all the guardsmen in the gardens?
Toussaint Noble Man 11|Is something afoot, do you think?
Toussaint Noble Man 03|It's a possibility. We must keep a keen eye on them.
Beauclair Bastard 04|Then we've to look by the water.
Beauclair Bastard 05|No nooks there, where one could hide.
Beauclair Bastard 04|Those are our orders.
Toussaint Noble Man 12|Is the game to your liking, ladies?
Toussaint Noble Woman 02|Aren't we Lord Curious-trousers!
Toussaint Noble Woman 03|Our mama told us not to talk to strangers.
Toussaint Noble Man 12|But there, just there, we made our acquaintances, did we not?
Toussaint Noble Woman 03|My humble opinion? De Peyrac-Peyran did nothing to deserve the honor of playing the Hare.
Toussaint Noble Woman 02|They say the duquessa has donned quite the avant-garde dress.
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|My favorite aspect of the Hare Hunt? The opportunities it affords to bond, rub elbows and other regions.
Toussaint Noble Man 12|I must say, King Cormorant - someone had quite the idea. Have you seen his costume?
Toussaint Noble Man 11|I'm quite curious who will win the hunt this year.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Diving! Who had that idea?! It's in poor taste.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|I was a hair's breadth from victory last year.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Alicorn did splendidly.
Beauclair Bastard 05|Where could he possibly have tucked himself away…?!
Beauclair Bastard 04|Hound's blood…

Halfling Man 01|Behold the fearless Zampanò of Belhaven!
Toussaint Noble Man 01|A fire eater? Who invited him?
Halfling Man 01|Nursed upon Mount Quartz's slopes by a she-dragon from her own teet, flames do him no harm!
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|Nonsense, and tasteless to boot. Come, darling.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Mademoiselle, are you certain you dropped it right here?
Toussaint Noble Woman 02|Yes! I cannot return without my engagement ring…!
Toussaint Noble Man 02|No, no! Please do not weep! I shall continue searching.
Toussaint Bard Man 04|Out flew the web and floated wide.
Toussaint Bard Man 04|The mirror crack'd from side to side.
Toussaint Bard Man 04|"The curse is come upon me," cried the Lady of Hengfors.
Toussaint Noble Woman 03|Ahhh.
Toussaint Noble Woman 11|Lovely.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Hm…
Toussaint Noble Man 03|The light, it's positively useless. She can't possibly see a thing.
Toussaint Noble Man 11|What, precisely, is that?
Toussaint Noble Woman 12|And abstract work, gentlemen. The future of art.
Halfling Man 01|Fret not, big man. Buffoons, naught else.
Toussaint Bard Man 01|I want to go back to the circus.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|It's a shame the midget knows no tricks. That would be funny, at the least.
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|Let's go to the picnic! I wish to see the unicorn!
Toussaint Noble Man 02|It must be somewhere…
Toussaint Noble Woman 02|Here! It's an heirloom! It was my grandmama's!
Toussaint Bard Man 04|Thank you..
Toussaint Noble Woman 03|What a charming man.
Toussaint Noble Woman 11|He's as good as Master Dandelion.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|You might also wish to catch my vernissage at the residence of Madame Orianna.
Toussaint Noble Man 11|To me it's spots and blotches. I don't know…
Toussaint Noble Woman 12|It's the future of painting, I tell you.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|No, rubbish, that will never catch on.
Geralt|There you go.
Toussaint Noble Woman 02|Oh! Thank you! I… I know not how to repay you!
Toussaint Noble Woman 03|I thank you! Again!
Toussaint Noble Man 02|A gift of the gods, you are!
<|endoftext|>
Anna Henrietta|On second thought, through here.
Anna Henrietta|I shall show you where the hunt plays out, then we will split up.
Anna Henrietta|You will get hold of the unicorn horn and the golden fish, while I nab the phoenix egg. That will be quickest.
Geralt|Golden fish… Do I need a rod, or a net…?
Anna Henrietta|Please, Geralt. It's not a real fish.
Anna Henrietta|Look there, towards the water - see the lights? The hunters are trying to hook the fish from boats. You must simply dive in and find it.
Geralt|The unicorn… how do I catch it?
Anna Henrietta|It's terribly skittish, true, but I'm sure you will find a way to earn its trust.
Anna Henrietta|It runs around over there - look.
Anna Henrietta|The golden fish and the horn both contain things or clues that will help us find Milton. Once you have fish and horn, find me among the other phoenix egg hunters.
Anna Henrietta|All clear? Then let's get to it.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Is that not counter to the rules?!
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|Who is that man?!
Toussaint Noble Woman 02|Look!
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Scandalous!
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Oh!
Toussaint Noble Woman 03|I feel faint…
Toussaint Noble Woman 11|My, he's brave!
Toussaint Noble Woman 11|Swim on, good man!
Toussaint Noble Man 01|What the blazes?!
Toussaint Noble Woman 02|Did someone just dive in the water?!
Toussaint Noble Woman 11|Perhaps that's the way to do it?
Toussaint Noble Man 11|Sure, if you're a peasant.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|That's an outrage!
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Bad form, sir!
Toussaint Noble Woman 02|Do something!
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Do what, exactly? Am I to jump in the water?
Toussaint Noble Man 11|Lodge an official protest!
Toussaint Noble Man 01|What a scoundrel!
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|Mmm-hm. But my is he manly.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|That is not allowed!
Toussaint Noble Woman 02|It will not do!
Toussaint Noble Man 03|You take the high road, and I'll take the low road,
Toussaint Noble Woman 03|And I'll be in Beauclair before you.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|But me and my true love shall never meet again,
Toussaint Noble Woman 03|On the vine-covered slopes of Mount Gorgon.
Toussaint Noble Woman 11|Hehehehe… O captain, my captain!
Toussaint Noble Man 11|You embarrass me, dear.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|As fable holds, the golden fish grants wishes.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|What, uh, would you suggest I request when I catch it?
Toussaint Noble Woman 02|I shall tell you later, whisper it in your ear, tee hee hee!
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|I love when all the courtiers get to mingle.
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|So many new faces… Ooh la la.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Old Man 05|Why, you bumbotched wretch!
Toussaint Noble Woman 02|He's ruined the game!
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 01|Disgraceful!
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 01|King Cormorant, Sire, accept this offering we bring. Prithee cast upon us your merciful eye and bare before us its secrets.
Toussaint Old Man 05|As the moon its heavenly course doth trace, in my demesne I await that moment of grace,
Toussaint Old Man 05|When a soul of good or ill repute, brings me a gift, fitting tribute…
Geralt|A key.
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 01|Don't cry, dear. The duchess will hear of this.
Toussaint Old Man 05|This is an outrage!
Geralt|Hey! Wait!
Geralt|Stop! It's important!
Toussaint Old Man 05|Welcome to the court of King Cormorant.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Well, that's hardly fair!
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Flagrant cheating is what it is!
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Sirs, we must teach this scamp some proper sportsmanship.
Geralt|Listen, I didn't break any rules.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|True, he won fair and square.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|We were unlucky, that's all.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|We must try to grab the next clue.
Geralt|Hands off, a man's life is at stake.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|A boldfaced lie.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Let's show the scoundrel the true meaning of valor.
Geralt|Wanna fight? Step on up.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|The cheek!
Toussaint Noble Man 03|At him, gents!
Geralt|Shh, calm down…
Geralt|Easy, now.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Halt, vagrant! I demand satisfaction!
Geralt|Fuck off. No time.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Hah!
Toussaint Noble Man 03|I hope you've learned your lesson.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|If not, we're available for more tutoring.
Geralt|Fuck-a-doodle-doo.
Geralt|No rematch, got no time. I'm in a hurry.
Geralt|Easy…
Geralt|Easy…
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Perhaps I should try once more to give it an apple.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|What about whistling? Anyone here know how to whistle?
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Stupid brute.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Unicorns are thought to like music.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|But this is no true unicorn.
Toussaint Noble Woman 12|I know it's not real, but it's so beautiful, all the same.
Toussaint Noble Woman 02|Come, gentlemen! We must catch it! Think of something!
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|It's Victor, Countess Notturna's steed.
Toussaint Noble Woman 11|Did you see that white-haired fellow?
Toussaint Noble Man 12|Ofieris are thought to catch horses by casting looped ropes round their necks.
Toussaint Noble Man 11|Perhaps we should try to hook the golden fish first?
Toussaint Noble Woman 03|Is it true Her Enlightened Highness has arrived?
Toussaint Noble Man 11|Thief!
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|How dare he!
Toussaint Noble Woman 02|Scandalous!
Toussaint Noble Woman 12|This is an outrage! An outrage, I tell you!
Toussaint Noble Man 12|It's against the rules!
Toussaint Noble Woman 03|Guards! Stop him! Grab him!
Toussaint Noble Woman 11|Yes! Call the guards!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Come on. Stay calm.
Geralt|Argh! Almost had it.
Geralt|Dammit.
Geralt|Gardens're huge. Be better off on horseback.
Geralt|Roach likes carrots. Maybe unicorn will, too…
Geralt|Cold game's not likely to tempt a unicorn.
Geralt|Roach wont' eat bread, either. Except if it's stale…
Geralt|Think unicorns - rainbows, little girls… sweets, maybe?
Geralt|Crispy apple - should like that like any other damn horse.
Geralt|Damn, doesn't have a sweet tooth.
Geralt|An apple - yum, yum.
Geralt|What would you say to a delicious, crunchy carrot?
Geralt|Too jumpy. Need to give it some space.
Geralt|Try it - it's tasty.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Got a key and a clue!
Anna Henrietta|And I've another! Show me yours!
Anna Henrietta|Who wrote this drivel?!
Anna Henrietta|"I begin like a groan hollowed out with ease, then end like a mouse with a head of hard cheese."
Geralt|Groans, hollows… Could be a cave, I guess.
Anna Henrietta|Now that's just silly.
Anna Henrietta|Look - if we take "groan," hollow it out and fill it with e's - the letters, that is - we get "green." Then "mouse" - but starting with what heads "hard cheese"? Why, it's "Greenhouse"!
Geralt|Hm, pretty clever. And it sounds right to me.
Anna Henrietta|There are several greenhouses in the gardens, but only one with a door that locks. And the key to it looks just like the one we found!
Geralt|Greenhouse it is, then. Let's go!
Geralt|Mice and cheese… Palace pantry, maybe?
Anna Henrietta|No, the Hare is obliged to hide here in the gardens.
Geralt|Let's see. "Groan" with e's gives us "green," right? And "mouse" with the head of "hard cheese"…?
Geralt|Green-house?
Anna Henrietta|You're a genius! Several greenhouses in the gardens, indeed! But only one with a door that locks! The key to which looks just like the one we found!
Geralt|Is it about someplace really cramped, uncomfortable?
Anna Henrietta|Because it mentions groans and a mouse? No, false hints, I think, meant to lead us astray.
Geralt|Too cryptic, this riddle. Got no idea what it's talking about.
Anna Henrietta|Then be silent and let me think.
Toussaint Noble Woman 03|But Your Grace…
Anna Henrietta|No buts.
Toussaint Noble Woman 03|I wish only…
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Forgive my wife, Your Grace. She wished to win so badly.
Beauclair Palace Servant Man 03|If you please, Your Grace…
Anna Henrietta|We do not please. We act out of the highest necessity. All shall be explained later.
Beauclair Palace Servant Man 03|But it's against the rules…
Anna Henrietta|I am the rules!
Anna Henrietta|Geralt! At last!
Beauclair Palace Servant Man 03|Your Grace! We did not expect--
Anna Henrietta|My dear subjects! Lend me your ears! Now!
Anna Henrietta|You must all spread out and penetrate the area! And bring me the phoenix egg!
Beauclair Palace Servant Man 03|But Your Grace…!
Anna Henrietta|I ask you nicely! Hop hop! Do this for me! The time to explain will come later!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Noble Man 11|Do you see anything? They should be in the woods.
Toussaint Noble Man 12|Gustav and Consuela… My, my… who would've thought?
Toussaint Noble Man 11|Let me!
Beauclair Palace Servant Man 01|Please collect your adventurer's kit - basket, letter, telescope and lantern.
Beauclair Palace Servant Man 03|Regretfully, sign-ups are now closed. So sorry.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Hm… now which one will serve best?
Toussaint Noble Woman 03|Uhh, do all contain the same hints? Err…
Anna Henrietta|Geralt! You're here!
Toussaint Noble Man 12|They always did seem to have a fondness for one another.
Toussaint Noble Man 11|Come on, let me have a look.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Noble Man 11|Ach!
Toussaint Noble Man 02|What the botch?
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Ugh!
Toussaint Noble Man 11|Aaauugh!
Toussaint Noble Man 01|What was that?!
Dettlaff|I'm here.
Geralt|This belong to you, maybe?
Dettlaff|It did. But you may keep it. I've a new one.
Dettlaff|I do not know you. I've done you no harm.
Dettlaff|Yet first you butchered a bruxa who was dear to me. Now you pursue me. Why?
Geralt|You've killed four innocent people. At least.
Dettlaff|And you? How many innocents have you cut down?
Geralt|Not here to talk about me.
Dettlaff|Yet that is exactly what we are doing. So, did they send you after me? Who are they?
Geralt|What do you mean, "they"? Duchess hired me. You've been murdering her subjects.
Dettlaff|Hmhmhmhm, is it as simple as that?
Dettlaff|I would ask you to convey to the duchess that I've but one victim left, but…
Dettlaff|You'll not get the chance.
Geralt|Plenty. Even more of the guilty, though. You're next.
Dettlaff|Hm, I think not. You see, I've something to do still.
Geralt|More murders?
Dettlaff|Just one.
Dettlaff|Not counting yours.
Geralt|I don't kill innocents. Murderers, though? You bet.
Dettlaff|I'll soon be done. I've but one left. And you, should you not stand down.
Geralt|And once you're done, intend to leave, go kill somewhere else?
Dettlaff|No. I intend to live.
Dettlaff|Happily ever after.
Geralt|I won't let you kill again!
Geralt|Wait here.
Anna Henrietta|Ah!
<|endoftext|>
Regis|Yes, Geralt. It's me.
Geralt|Regis…? I… You all right?
Regis|All is well, all's in order. Wounds such as these heal on vampires in moments. But we've not seen one another in ages, my friend. At least in human terms, that is.
Geralt|How's this even possible? Last I saw you--
Regis|I was a bubbling, shapeless smear, having been rather spectacularly melted into a column of a certain castle.
Regis|In somewhat better shape now, as you can see. Hardly peak form, mind you, but were I human, folk would think me a demigod, I daresay.
Geralt|I'm sorry. What happened - it was my fault. Never got a chance to apologize.
Regis|No need, Geralt. Bygones. I did not have to join you on that expedition. No one twisted my arm.
Geralt|Local serial killer seems to obey you. Maybe you could talk him out of it, convince him to stop murdering.
Regis|Why do you think I've come? It shall not be easy, as Dettlaff can be rather stubborn. Though you must certainly recall that neither do I surrender readily.
Geralt|So that's his name. He's your… friend?
Regis|You might call it that. Though Dettlaff is… how would you humans put it… more bestial than I am. But not to worry, I'm working on him.
Geralt|Haven't exactly done a great job with that. He's killed one knight since I got here, least three others before I arrived.
Regis|For good reason, I'm sure. Understand, Dettlaff is not some decadent shit who kills for sport or to assuage a dryness of throat or a dullness of mood.
Geralt|So in your opinion, what're his reasons?
Regis|Precisely what I wish to find out. And then I will convince him of the error of his ways.
Geralt|Got a lot of faith in the guy.
Regis|Despite appearances to the contrary, you two are quite alike. You've both noble hearts yet you both are wont to perform ignoble deeds - when circumstances force you to, of course.
Regis|Remember the year 964?
Geralt|That was three centuries ago…
Regis|Blind fear gripped Rivia, Lyria and Spalla. Women and children were dying, their mutilated, dismembered corpses littered the fields.
Geralt|Brute of Lyria - read about it. Chewed up almost two hundred, then fell to a common poacher supposedly armed with a dagger blessed by some prophet--
Regis|It fell to Dettlaff. Who then found a poacher asleep in the brush near his snares and dropped the fiend's corpse at his feet. And thus, a legend was born.
Geralt|Hm. Vampires rarely help humans. Must've had his own agenda, hunting the beast.
Regis|You err. He slew it for one reason alone - the monster killed a lad who once, in the street, had offered Dettlaff an apple, expecting nothing in return.
Geralt|Terribly noble of him.
Regis|You do not have a monopoly on altruism, my friend.
Regis|Vilgefortz melted my body. Dettlaff found what was left. As per our codex, he had a choice - to leave me where I was, or to care for me, nurture my remains.
Regis|He chose the latter. Regenerated me at no small expense in his own blood. Do you know what that means to a vampire, the gravity of the endeavor?
Geralt|Probably same thing it means to a human. You owe him your life.
Regis|Much more than that. The act itself made us blood brethren, a bond so strong humans cannot even imagine. Which is why I know something ill is afoot.
Geralt|Always had an overdeveloped sense of empathy.
Regis|Each vampire has a unique talent. One they hone over centuries. It's precisely what renders us so difficult to classify. Dettlaff's trump card is his herd instinct, his tribal propensity.
Regis|In point of fact, he prefers the company of lesser vampires and shuns that of humans. If he walks among you, killing egregiously, it can only mean something's upset him. Immensely.
Geralt|Gotta find him. Before something upsets him even more and all Beauclair is awash with blood.
Regis|Well, we share a cause, then. Just like the old days…
Geralt|Not entirely. I mean, when I find him, you know--
Regis|I know you've a contract on his head. Yet your true task is to stop the Beast killing, not necessarily to kill the Beast, am I right?
Geralt|All in all, sure.
Regis|Let us find him. By the time we do, I hope I'll have convinced you Dettlaff is no monster.
Geralt|Fine, all right already. But for now, evidence is stacking up against him…
Regis|Hear that?
Geralt|The posse. Knights must've tracked me here.
Regis|I'd prefer they not find me here. I've makeshift quarters at Mère-Lachaiselongue cemetery. We'll meet there.
Geralt|See you.
Palmerin|Witcher! We flew here as fast as our coursers would carry us. Yet I fear we're late all the same! Pray, where is the Beast?!
Geralt|Still investigating, about to inspect this site. Withdraw your men before they trample all over the evidence.
Palmerin|Ahem, sirs! We must let the witcher do his work. Milton's murder cannot go unavenged.
Geralt|Anything specific, some set of things that'd be likely to set him off?
Regis|How should I say this… Dettlaff doesn't understand men, their world, its rules, its conventions. He's naïve, in a sense. He doesn't comprehend your games, knows not what it means to lie, deceive.
Geralt|Suggesting he's maladjusted… and venting his rage?
Regis|I'm suggesting maladjustment can at times breed conflict. But is it the case this time? I cannot say… but intend to find out.
Geralt|Awfully good of him. But… do I need to know this?
Regis|Yes. So you'll understand Dettlaff is no cold-blooded killer. I believe he's landed in some mess, and he sees no way out.
Geralt|What makes you say that?
Geralt|Seem pretty damn sure of that.
Regis|I am. Because I know him very well.
Geralt|Everyone's got their reasons, but he's crossed a line. Want him to stop - don't give a damn why he's doing it.
Regis|Perhaps you should. Motivations change the contours of all situations. A thief who steals to feed his family versus one who steals out of greed - would you not treat them differently?
Geralt|Mean to suggest Dettlaff's killing out of some worthy, dire need?
Regis|I merely suggest he's not a bloodthirsty monster who murders simply for the joy of it. That's just not him.
Geralt|You being here - not some fortunate coincidence, I take it.
Regis|Your powers of deduction seem to have waned not one bit. I'm happy.
Regis|I came here for Dettlaff. I fear he's become entangled, landed himself in serious trouble.
Geralt|So you being here, it's no coincidence…
Geralt|Miraculous regeneration - how'd you manage it?
Regis|I had help. From the one you hunt.
Geralt|Him? How? And what've you been doing all these years?
Regis|Not the time nor place for such stories. I suspect we'll get a chance to speak at ease and at length later. Now, however, we must deal with the reason that brought us both here.
Dettlaff|You were to stay where you were. Regenerate.
Regis|I know you're in trouble. I can help.
Dettlaff|I'll help myself.
Regis|No. He's my friend.
Palmerin|Good hunting to you, witcher. We're relying on your mastery of your craft.
Palmerin|Good sirs, we must allow the witcher to ply his trade.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Regis. Couldn't have picked some other place to meet…?
Geralt|Agreed to meet a vampire at a cemetery. How much more cliché can you get?
Regis|Hahaha. Nothing comes readily to mind.
Regis|But we did not meet so I could prove how very original I am.
Geralt|True enough. Need to find your friend. I'm hoping you'll agree to help.
Regis|I shall do whatever's in my power. Yet what you want or even need must matter little. What matters is what Dettlaff wants. If he does not wish to be found, you will not find him. Ever. End of story.
Geralt|Come on, gotta be some way…
Regis|Hm. Vampires can evade detection by the senses, and no divination magic works on us. Even the most precise megascope would be useless…
Geralt|And this? Could this help?
Regis|Where ever did you get that?
Geralt|Off one of the Beast's victims, found by a bend in the river. Body was chopped, in pieces. Three of those pieces were hands.
Geralt|Hand with the ring seemed the odd one out. A bruxa had taken an interest in it.
Regis|It's Dettlaff's hand, without a doubt. It will do splendidly.
Geralt|Covinarius spent half his life proving his theory. Wild guess - making a dose of Resonance won't be easy.
Regis|You guess correctly. In addition to Dettlaff's tissue, we shall need a powerful occipital lobe stimulant - effectively a poison to make one susceptible to visions.
Geralt|Hm. Well, got a few ingredients to choose from. Unfortunately, all are pretty rare…
Geralt|There's mamune glands, but closest ones I know of are in Vizima. A spotted wight's saliva would also serve, but they were culled to extinction over a century ago. Could go with a kobold's eyes, but the creatures are sentient - rather not gouge one's eyes out…
Regis|Hmm… Given that we lack the time to sleuth this out ourselves, permit me to summon some help.
Geralt|What was that?
Regis|A raven. Rather a common sight at this latitude. Very intelligent fowl. I asked him to look for the creatures you mentioned. Him and his brethren.
Regis|Perhaps they'll find one in the area. And I would hazard that a flock of ravens will spy any said creature faster than a solitary witcher would - with all due respect to your skills, my friend.
Regis|It will take them some time, nonetheless, so… perhaps you'd care for a snifter of mandrake?
Geralt|Rarely say no to a snifter.
Regis|Sadly, this is but a weak infusion rather than a proper distillate.
Geralt|Even better. I remember your mandrake hooch. Made people say things they'd have rather kept to themselves.
Regis|Now, what could Geralt of Rivia prefer to keep to himself?
Geralt|Guess you missed my point, Regis. I was glad to hear it's not the hooch because I don't want to talk about what I don't want to talk about.
Regis|Oh, I understood you far better than you think. Allow me to reveal a secret - my mandrake distillate possesses no particular tongue-loosening powers.
Regis|Those who drink it and talk simply have burdens they wish to lift off their shoulders. The hooch is but a convenient excuse, a cover that justifies their sudden candidness to themselves.
Geralt|All right, you first. Any burdens you want to unload? Vampires lead highly interesting lives - bet you've got some good secrets.
Regis|Anything in particular interest you?
Geralt|Got plenty of questions I'd like to ask, but let's postpone any longer conversations until things calm down.
Regis|Unable to focus your thoughts at the moment? I understand. I, too, am anxious to know the news…
Geralt|Still no sign of your winged friend… Sure it understood what you wanted?
Regis|Dead certain. Let's wait a bit longer. It'll return soon, don't doubt that for a moment.
Regis|Ever vigilant, even in his sleep. Quite vampire-like, in fact. Are you absolutely certain they don't administer a few of our genes during the Trial of the Grasses?
Geralt|Appreciate the compliment. Got something for me?
Regis|You were right. No kobolds or mamunes - for miles around--
Geralt|Knew it.
Regis|Allow me to finish. You see, there's this spotted wight. It haunts an abandoned residence in the Caroberta Woods.
Geralt|Impossible. My brethren hunted down every last spotted wight before I was born.
Regis|Then it seems you must revise your knowledge of spotted wights. For somehow this one managed to survive your brethren's onslaught.
Regis|Hm. It seems I know this home it haunts - recall a tale about it… Locals believe the place cursed. Perhaps that's how the wight survived, entirely unmolested…
Geralt|Let's do this - start making your decoction while I go get some saliva from that wight. Uses it in its brews.
Regis|Do you imagine the wight will simply sell you some?
Geralt|Worst case scenario, I'll bring you its salivary glands. They oughta do as well.
Regis|For a moment there I imagined you asking the wight to spit into a vial. Quite amusing as a thought. But the salivary glands will do fine, indeed.
Geralt|So, see you later.
Regis|Yes, till later. I shall start by perusing some tomes.
Geralt|Tomes? Thought you were gonna make this decoction.
Regis|We require one last ingredient. Alas, obtaining it could prove a trifle toilsome. Thus I hope to identify a suitable alternative.
Geralt|All right. Good luck.
Regis|And to you, my friend.
Geralt|Hm. Know anything else about this curse?
Regis|I don't recall much in particular. Really don't attach much importance to such things. It was mentioned to me, as an anecdote, no more…
Geralt|Come on. Search your memory - something, anything, could be important.
Regis|Hmm… I believe it had a relation to hunger… or no, perhaps greed, rapacity? Someone was punished for something…
Geralt|Textbook definition of a curse, pretty much.
Regis|Sorry, Geralt, I try not to clutter my mind with the details of every far-fetched tale I happen to hear.
Geralt|Hmm…
Regis|What are your thoughts?
Geralt|A specimen of a species thought long-extinct… and a curse - in one place. That a coincidence, or are they related?
Regis|Ah, professional curiosity. Personally I've nothing against you delving into this dilemma, but please remember we need the wight's saliva. Nothing beyond that.
Geralt|Wights rarely appear in the woods, even less likely to find them in abandoned human homes. They inhabit remote wildernesses, old, abandoned cemeteries…
Regis|What's your point?
Geralt|This might not be a spotted wight after all. Your little helper might've made a mistake.
Regis|I sincerely doubt it. Ravens are devilishly intelligent creatures. And they've highly developed observational skills.
Geralt|What exactly did they observe?
Regis|The area around the estate, it's covered in… spoons.
Geralt|Spoons?
Regis|Spare me the skeptical smile, I'm but the bearer of this news. Perhaps this spotted wight is a hoarder? Or the spoons are somehow related to the curse?
Geralt|Far as I know, none. Now whatcha got for me?
Geralt|All right, give you one question. What do you want to know?
Regis|One question to ask one as fascinating as you, Geralt? Cruel parsimony, I'd say. But I shall do my best to make it count.
Regis|If you were to die and be reborn as I was… in your new life, would you choose to be a witcher?
Geralt|See, Regis…
Geralt|Doubt I'd know how to be anything else.
Regis|Ever tried?
Geralt|See you're determined to get an answer. To find out if I like being a witcher. Just refuse to ask directly, as always.
Geralt|I like being on the Path. Like picking up a lead, a trail… I like the tension right before a fight.
Geralt|And nothing gets my adrenaline flowing like battling a beast. Even gotten used to people treating me like a freak, an outcast.
Geralt|Yeah. Not something I think about much, but I like being a witcher.
Regis|Thank you for being honest. Honesty's an attribute of the truly brave - and thus a privilege of the very few.
Geralt|That's what interests you most? Whether I'd like to be a witcher again?
Regis|Many things interest me, but we've not much time left. Please answer.
Geralt|Never chose to be a witcher, fate chose for me. Had it been my choice, I'd have picked a different profession.
Geralt|A profession where I wouldn't have to risk my life every minute of every day. Maybe even one that'd earn me some respect.
Geralt|Curious what you did after you were… reborn.
Regis|As I'm sure you can surmise, at first I was thoroughly absorbed with recovering. As it is, I've still not recovered completely. Yet I was so weak the first year that I could not stand nor move on my own.
Regis|Dettlaff bore my weakness bravely, showed great patience. If not for him, I wouldn't be here, and I'd have regenerated far slower.
Regis|Once I could at last stand unassisted, I set off for Brugge, for my one-time home of Dillingen. There I led the peaceful life of a rural healer and surgeon, enjoying my neighbors' respect and, in fact, constituting the exact opposite of the monstrous vampire the populace imagines.
Geralt|Brugge, you say? Rebirth make you sentimental?
Regis|Perhaps a dash. But what of you? Where have you been? Ever find your Cirilla?
Geralt|Back then, yeah. But we parted again soon after. And when the time was ripe, she came back. Defeated the Wild Hunt together.
Regis|Oo, seems I certainly missed quite a bit while I was… absent!
Geralt|True enough. But it's a conversation we'll have another time. Need to know more about you, now.
Geralt|Back then, yeah. But we parted again soon after.
Geralt|Gotta ask you the big question, one everyone wonders about - what happens after death?
Regis|You wish me to tell you if the human belief in the gods is well founded. That I do not know. We vampires differ exceedingly from you humans.
Regis|Our matter, that of which we are composed, can exist without form. We require neither a heart nor a brain nor air to breathe.
Geralt|But were you dead?
Regis|As humans understand death - yes.
Geralt|Feel anything? Understand anything?
Regis|Hm. It's rather hard to explain. I felt something very unsettling. Something I cannot even name, for I did no reasoning.
Regis|Only after rebirth did I begin to understand that what I had felt was cold and unimaginable fear. If not for Dettlaff, I might have drowned in an eternity of icy terror.
Geralt|Can't have been alive, then. Sheesh, experience like that must be vicious.
Regis|Hmm… Indeed, it's… it's hard to compare to anything I know. Yet you are aware we don't see death as you do. The way you cling to life - we find it entirely peculiar. You are mortals, ergo it's a foregone conclusion - you will die. It's but a question of time.
Regis|Thus I often find myself wondering why you try so very hard. To die at twenty years, forty, even a hundred - what's the difference? They're all but the blink of an eye.
Geralt|Depends on your point view. Man who's got a million crowns to spend can't possibly understand one who's only got twenty.
Regis|Very true. One's outlook can indeed change much.
Geralt|Got a new life, a new body. That give you a new start, a blank slate?
Regis|Starting all anew is a very broad concept. What exactly do you mean?
Geralt|Your blood addiction, say. Wondering if your body's the same, if it still remembers. Maybe if you drank now, you wouldn't get hooked.
Regis|All addictions are a form of slavery. Readdiction's not a risk I'm willing to take just to test a hypothesis about corporeal regeneration and whether propensities carry over.
Geralt|Fair enough. Curiosity, that's all. Sorry.
Regis|Not to worry, Geralt. Curiosity's a natural reaction under the circumstances. Apart from which, I've always valued that trait in you.
Geralt|Always fascinated me the way vampires can regenerate. A hand growing back is one thing, but Dettlaff recreating you out of a wet smear? Something else entirely.
Regis|A difficult and laborious process, but one that's possible - as my presence proves. But, but, but… I've heard you too had quite the adventure - they say you lost your memory.
Geralt|For a bit. but Triss helped me get it back. Actually pretty damn lucky I only had amnesia.
Regis|Yes, you humans are rather buggered in those terms. To strip you of life is, well, just plain easy. I've always pitied you in that regard.
Regis|We vampires are much harder nuts to crack. If a member of another race kills one of us, we can be reborn with a living higher vampire's help.
Regis|However, if one of our own strikes the deadly blow, death is permanent. There can be no rebirth. One of the chief reasons why vampires long ago swore never to fight one another.
Geralt|So, think you've set a nice little trap for me? Sorry. Wanna get me to confess? Gonna have to try harder.
Regis|I love a challenge! In that case, my ears are cocked - what must I do?
Geralt|Hm… how about you get the ball rolling, reveal one of your secrets? Vampires - intriguing creatures, must lead fascinating lives.
Geralt|Everyone's got some secret.
Regis|I agree wholeheartedly. I also believe it wise at times to share one's secrets, unburden oneself to those one can trust.
Geralt|This your sophisticated way of asking me if I trust you?
Regis|I prefer almost always to ask indirectly. It seems a test of intelligence - one you just passed.
Geralt|Hm. Maybe you should go first, reveal one of your secrets? After all, you vampires lead very interesting lives.
Geralt|Not really in the mood for your concoctions. Especially given how they make you say things you'd rather keep to yourself. Remember that aspect very well.
Regis|Geralt of Rivia, do I detect a guilty conscience? Word is only those ashamed of the truth seek to conceal it.
Geralt|Not about to fall for that. Forget it. Need a nap, and that's how I'm gonna use this time.
Geralt|The hand, what do you plan to do with it?
Regis|You've heard of Covinarius' theory of tissue memory retention?
Geralt|Hm. Rings a distant bell… Read about it in "Alchemia Oblittera." There's a copy at Kaer Morhen, tattered, nearly disintegrated.
Geralt|But if memory serves, Covinarius never managed to prove it worked.
Regis|He did prove it. Just never managed to publish his findings. He and I corresponded, you see, after we became friends. Thus I know he completed his research and performed the first tests.
Regis|It's complicated, so without delving into details, it is possible to use any piece of tissue to reconstruct what a whole body experienced.
Geralt|How's it work? We need any special equipment?
Regis|We must brew a decoction which Covinarius gave a rather poetic name - Resonance. Once imbibed, it sends one into a trance similar to that induced by narcotics.
Regis|This triggers visions of events linked to strong emotions experienced by the tissue's owner. Picture it as dreaming a fragment of someone's life.
Geralt|Any chance we might see what Dettlaff was doing just before he lost his hand…?
Regis|Indeed. Though I also hope Resonance will reveal the location of Dettlaff's hideout.
Geralt|Ring's pretty intriguing. Made of no metal I've every seen. And the ornamentation…
Regis|It comes from our home - where we lived before the Conjunction of Spheres. It's actually mine. I received it from a dear old friend.
Regis|You might call him a… humanist. He saw us, vampires, as guests here, guests who owe their hosts, meaning you humans and the Elder Races, respect.
Geralt|Respect? Meaning not to treat us like cattle to be slaughtered for food…
Regis|Precisely. And the reason why I, in turn, gave it to Dettlaff - to remind him of the ideals my old friend championed.
Geralt|Can't you just summon Dettlaff? You're both higher vampires, there's gotta be a way…
Regis|If I'm to be entirely candid, there is indeed one. But believe me, we will be better off never availing ourselves of it. It is a last resort. Absolutely.
Geralt|Last resort? The hell. Why?
Regis|Agh. There is a being who can summon Dettlaff. Possesses the authority, even the power, to force him to appear in a given place.
Regis|But the very act of contacting this being, well, it's akin to walking a slack line extended over a chasm filled with molten lava.
Regis|An exercise as perilous to me as it would be to you - a risk I'm unwilling to take. I beg you, let's do it my way - it'll be both quicker and easier.
Geralt|Could've left the door unlatched.
Regis|What of my privacy? I value it rather deeply. Unmolested, especially by unwanted guests - that's my preferred state. Besides, I knew you'd find a way to get in.
Geralt|Decoction coming along? Doing all right?
Regis|Better than you. No sign of the wight's brew or its salivary glands, I see.
Geralt|Decaying bones. Kikimores must've tunneled into the grave.
Regis|I shall set up my gear, start brewing Resonance. No reason to delay.
Geralt|Dammit, locked. No way I got the place wrong. This is it, gotta be.
Geralt|Gotta be another way in around here.
Geralt|Kikimores. Had vittles aplenty around here.
Geralt|Kikimore eggs. Need to incinerate these to ash.
Geralt|That's some stench.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Regis' raven wasn't lying. Spoons all over the place.
Geralt|Strange… Get a sense that the spoons are beating out some kind of rhythm, a message… trying to tell me something.
Geralt|Barghests… Never a good omen.
Geralt|Hm. Actually does seem like a wight's lair. Bit atypical, but still. Cauldron should be somewhere around here…
Geralt|A spoon key, sophisticated crafting. Tag bears a description.
Geralt|Wight's a true collector.
Geralt|Woman's name scratched into this wooden spoon. Romantic…
Geralt|Spoon's incredible, the craftsmanship… Must've graced a rich man's table.
Geralt|Cauldron I was looking for. Wight's not particularly tidy…
Geralt|Cauldron's empty, unfortunately. Regis needs some brew. Afraid he won't get that…
Geralt|No choice but to hide and wait for the saliva glands. And their bearer. Need a spot that'll let me observe the cauldron.
Geralt|"None shall sit and dine with you at your table, no spoon you have shall sate you, never again shall you wish to spy your reflection in the mirror."
Geralt|Sounds like a curse, all right…
Geralt|Somebody's clearly obsessed.
Geralt|Regis mentioned the place might be cursed. Can't be a coincidence. Need to look around.
Geralt|"None shall sit and dine with you at your table, no spoon you have shall sate you, never again shall you wish to spy your reflection in the mirror."
Geralt|Table's set… Wight who lives here is getting ready for some sort of feast.
Geralt|Skeletons… Doubt they came here willingly.
Geralt|This have anything to do with the curse? "None shall sit and dine with you at your table." It'd make sense.
Geralt|Smashed mirror… as if someone couldn't stand to look at themselves.
Geralt|The monster - journal's author, maybe?
Geralt|"No spoon you have shall sate you." Whatever lives here treated that literally. Still searching for the right spoon.
Geralt|Wight that lives here - definitely afflicted by a curse. And it's been trying desperately to lift it.
Geralt|Poor girl… Realized she was changing into a monster, recorded it in her diary. Poignant.
Geralt|No claw or fang marks. Probably choked to death.
Geralt|Broken neck, indentation in the skull's lateral surface. Smacked in the head with something heavy.
Geralt|Right arm bit right off. Teeth all knocked out. Somebody tried to force-feed him…
Geralt|What a pigsty. Need to search it, thoroughly. Find a way to collect some wight saliva.
Geralt|Wight's obsessed. A real collector. Thoroughbred.
Geralt|Spoon, pretty ordinary, maybe a little old.
Geralt|Another spoon. Yup, just as normal as the last one.
Geralt|Hm, that's awful pretty… It'll look great in the house.
Geralt|Thousands of 'em here. Wight's been a collector for years.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|I'm not gonna hurt you. Wanna help.
Geralt|I've seen the words of the curse on the walls. Think I know how to lift it.
Geralt|You tried to bring folk here, convince them to sit at the table with you, right? Well, I'm gonna be your guest now. Your willing guest.
Geralt|Just need a bit for Regis.
Geralt|And now we'll tend to you.
Geralt|Been searching for the right spoon for years, right? But curses can be tricky.
Geralt|Key to this one just might be that you can't eat with your own spoon.
Geralt|That's why we've swapped.
Geralt|This isn't right… I miss something?
Geralt|Listen, gonna stand up real slow. Gotta search the house again. Sit tight. I'll be right back.
Geralt|Calm down.
Geralt|We can't use spoons.
Geralt|No, that won't work. You've been looking for a spoon that would feed you, but there's no such spoon. We need to eat without spoons.
Geralt|Open your eyes. You need to see your likeness.
Geralt|Need to get this right. Words of the curse were: "None shall sit and dine with you at your table, no spoon you have shall sate you, never again shall you wish to spy your reflection in the mirror."
Geralt|Dammit! Gotta catch it.
Geralt|Cook hasn't had time to make the brew… Just foul, muddy water now.
Geralt|Seems I'll have to kill the wight in its own junk heap.
Geralt|Now to carve out its salivary glands…
Geralt|Wight's salivary glands'll have to do for Regis. High time I got them to him.
Geralt|Hope there's a drop of brew left in the cauldron for Regis.
Geralt|Dammit… didn't work. Ate that vile stuff for nothing.
Geralt|Got the brew for Regis, at least. Can't do anything for the wight, though. Except cut it down.
Geralt|Think it worked… Just, not quite like I expected.
Geralt|Need to see what happened to the wight.
Geralt|Won't be hard to find, given its stench.
Geralt|Shit, screwed up with the curse. Regis'll get what he wants, though. There is that.
<|endoftext|>
Regis|Beyond this wall lies…
Geralt|An ancient vampire dungeon. Seen a lot of things in my time. Nothing quite like this, though.
Regis|My, I feel honored. A man with such a wealth of experience, yet I'm about to show him something new. Now to open it.
Geralt|Think your friend's hand'll make for a nice broth?
Regis|Hm, you've clearly honed your sense of humor. But we are not cannibals, Geralt. I took a fragment of tissue from the hand. It will suffice to prepare some Resonance.
Geralt|What'd you do with the rest?
Regis|I cremated it, as our codex commands. A raven told me you'd acquired the necessary ingredient.
Geralt|Send your spies after me?
Regis|My watchers. Were something to go wrong, I could then arrive quickly to help.
Geralt|Managed fine alone, but… thanks for the thought. Gonna need much longer to finish brewing Resonance? Mentioned a last ingredient, too - what about that?
Regis|That, I fear, might prove troublesome. You see, to use the concoction to summon the memories of one, the solution must contain the blood of another specimen of the same species.
Geralt|Shouldn't be a problem. I happen to know a higher vampire who should be willing to help. Right, Regis?
Regis|It's not that simple, I'm afraid. While you were away I tried my damndest to identify a replacement, but alas, none such exists.
Geralt|Not sure I understand what the problem is. Can't we just draw some of your blood?
Regis|The blood must be in an agitated state. As I'm certain you know, higher vampires can change their corporeal shell. As our flesh changes, so does our blood's chemical composition.
Regis|To make a long story short, I shall need to induce in myself a state of strong psychokinetic arousal. In brief, madness, rabidity. And that stands to be very, very dangerous.
Geralt|All right, so what do you wanna do?
Regis|We shall visit Tesham Mutna, an ancient vampire estate. There we will find cages suspended in the air. I will enter one, be confined. You will lure beasts there.
Regis|Beasts you will then kill. The bloodletting should prove profuse. Abundant enough so that the blood's scent will drive me mad, wild.
Geralt|See no reason to dawdle. Tesham Mutna - take me there.
Regis|In a moment. Just one last thing…
Geralt|What was that?
Regis|Blood. The last favor the raven did me. I've also taken some sangurium, a solution that sharpens one's sense of smell. One drop of blood shall smell like a gallon to me, now.
Geralt|You crazy?! You're a recovering addict!
Regis|Your outrage warms my heart, Geralt, but you must remain calm. I had no choice.
Regis|As things stand, the die is cast. High time we set off for Tesham Mutna. My head's spinning already, and you're starting to smell quite tasty…
Geralt|And you're starting to scare me.
Regis|We have arrived. The sacrificial chamber of torture and torment lies underground.
Geralt|You lead.
Geralt|Scurvers. Must be getting close to their feeding ground.
Regis|Correct. I told you there'd be danger.
Geralt|Sure you know what you're doing?
Regis|I can only hope I do. Please, let's go? The longer we delay, the less control I shall have of my faculties. I'd really prefer not to hurt you.
Geralt|Tesham Mutna - what's it like?
Regis|It is a place of torment, a torture chamber. Long ago, shortly after we'd arrived in this world, one among us named Khagmar developed such a taste and lust for human blood that in one night he could imbibe an entire village.
Regis|This brought trouble on the entire species. Common folk wearied quickly of living in constant fear. They began to hunt us, seek the aid of mages and witchers in tracking us down.
Geralt|So what? Not like they could ever hope to kill you.
Regis|But they were bothersome. Forgive the comparison, but when did you last enjoy mosquito buzzing around your head? In any case, the other vampires decided something had to be done, Khagmar had to be caught and punished.
Regis|A torture chamber was thus outfitted in the dungeons of Tesham Mutna. Inside it, a cage made entirely of a special alloy of silver, dalvinite and meteorite steel.
Regis|Khagmar was captured and locked in the cage. Sat there over two centuries, driven to fury time after time, never able to escape. Thus I know the cage will withstand the fury to which we shall drive my humble being.
Geralt|Little expedition's starting to sound dangerous. Think I better prepare.
Regis|I understand completely. Do tell me when you're ready to set off.
Geralt|Dangerous? Why? I mean, you'll still be you, right?
Regis|True. But I shall be highly agitated, in a state of fury. You know better than I that fury cannot be controlled..
Regis|If you've ever seen an enraged vampire, you know very well that all who find themselves nearby will be in grave danger.
Geralt|How will we handle that? I'd rather not have you lunge at me, claws extended.
Regis|That makes two of us. But worry not. I've thought it through very thoroughly. Details to follow, soon.
Geralt|Pretty helpful creatures. Call on them often?
Regis|I try not to overdo it. But they can be so useful. As they were now, when I merely needed to be sure I could arrive in time should things go sour.
Geralt|Regis.
Regis|Ah, there you are! Might we set off for Tesham Mutna now?
Geralt|How the hell…?
Regis|It's an ancient form of protection against unwanted guests. The mechanism which releases the latch reacts only to a higher vampire's blood.
Geralt|Tricky mechanisms, a vampire hideout - fortified, secured. Must've been important to your species once, Toussaint.
Regis|It shall always be so. During the Conjunction, the gate from our world into this one opened upon this land and no other. This was the first place we saw.
Geralt|This place - there's evil here. Death hangs in the air.
Regis|Yes. A great many beings have breathed their last here.
Geralt|Victim's been disemboweled. Intestines ripped clear out.
Geralt|Scurvers've gnawed on this corpse. Repeatedly.
Geralt|Something wicked here. It's in the air, I can smell it…
Geralt|"Human Husbandry and Care"? This for real?
Regis|The author observed humans, their behavior, over the many years he spent breeding them. Morally suspect though it may be, it's a thorough survey of the topic.
Geralt|This'll hold? Doesn't look like anything special.
Regis|It's forged of an alloy of silver, dalvinite, and meteorite steel. It will hold.
Regis|I told you - Khagmar thrashed about inside it for over two centuries. Appearances can be deceiving.
Geralt|Cells? Who for?
Regis|Ahh, disgraceful, excruciatingly so, this particular page from our history… I'd rather not summon the demons of the past, if it's all right with you.
Geralt|Glyphs're carved into the rock. Coated with blood, used to be. They mean something?
Regis|They're emblems, symbols of hmm… what you would call tribes, dispersed throughout the world after the Conjunction. My ancestors placed them here to remind us all where we came from.
Geralt|What's this symbol mean?
Regis|It's the symbol of the Tdet. Those who went east, beyond the Blue Mountains.
Geralt|Who's is this glyph?
Regis|Ammurun. They ventured beyond the sea.
Geralt|And this one? Which tribe's this?
Regis|Gharasham. My tribe, and Dettlaff's. We both remained in this part of the world.
Geralt|Seems your kind assembled a peculiar little library…
Regis|Indeed… Though I personally did not lay a hand to it.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Charming place. But… what're all those cages for? Mentioned one vampire being kept here.
Regis|Yes, well… You see, humanitarians is something my ancestors were not. They concluded Khagmar would best be punished if he were tormented with the scent of blood he could not taste.
Regis|Thus, they also kept humans here, humans whose blood they slowly let. Khagmar ranted and raged in pain as those… those humans slowly bled to death…
Geralt|They treated them like livestock, live bait.
Regis|I'd like to be able to turn back time, deny it, but alas… I can do neither. Feel shame for my brethren, that is all I can do.
Geralt|Don't take it so hard. Nothing you could've done about it. Let's get to work.
Regis|Well, that was awkward. Fine. I prepared the bait, please be so kind and place it. Ideally at the tunnel entrances - the scent will spread most effectively, then.
Regis|Place the bait at the tunnel entrances. Monsters will catch its scent more quickly.
Geralt|When I think how these tunnels got here… sends shivers.
Regis|It was the natural order of things - the place reeked of death and attracted necrophages.
Geralt|Feel all right, Regis?
Regis|How I feel is unimportant. My blood, agitated and transformed - that's what matters. It's what we need to save Dettlaff.
Regis|It's not far now, Geralt.
Geralt|Three done, one left. Think this'll work?
Regis|I certainly hope so. The meat's stench is so thick I wager it carries clear to Novigrad.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Maybe we need a safe word? You know, something you'll say when you can't take it any more.
Regis|And what would you do once I uttered it?
Geralt|Don't know. Uh, calm you down… somehow…
Regis|Please, Geralt. You won't be able to. We must forge through this, that is all.
Geralt|Aha. Regis has smelled the blood…
Regis|Aaaaarrrggh!
Geralt|Hanging in there?
Regis|It… it grows… worse and worse… but I shall overcome…
Geralt|Good, 'cause I can hear more coming.
Regis|Aaaarrrrrgghhh!
Geralt|Hold on! I'll let you out!
Geralt|Bait's set. What now?
Regis|I shall enter the cage. You must chain me inside. The bars are made of an alloy that will prevent me from transforming into mist.
Geralt|Kinda thought you wouldn't want to.
Regis|I shall be in great pain, my sole thought being to stop that pain. I cannot know what I will do.
Regis|We must hurry. The beasts have caught the scent. Also, my head's started spinning.
Geralt|That the blood?
Regis|Someone who's never experienced a vampire's bloodlust… does not know the true meaning of thirst.
Regis|Aaaaarrrggh!
Regis|Aaaaarrrggh!
Regis|That smell!
Regis|Grrrrrhrrrrr!
Regis|Aaaaarrrggh!
Regis|Aaaaarrrggh!
Geralt|That's it. He's transformed.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Need to hang on a little longer. Blood'll dry in a few hours. Scent won't bother you anymore.
Geralt|Get you out of here.
Regis|The concoction…
Geralt|You can't finish it in this state. Tell me how, I'll help you.
Geralt|Any better?
Regis|Far from ideal and some time must pass before I fully recover, but yes, a bit better. Thank you.
Geralt|Resonance, it's ready.
Regis|Are you certain you followed the formula? The proportions were exact, the brewing time precise?
Regis|This is important, Geralt. The slightest deviation could cost even a witcher dearly.
Geralt|Relax. Got some experience brewing potions.
Regis|Very well… In that case, let's begin.
Regis|Awake at last. You writhed like a squirrel caught in a snare. I'd begun to fear they were death throes, that you'd… departed.
Geralt|Ehh… Sure wasn't pleasant… but it worked.
Regis|What did you see?
Geralt|De la Croix… his death did not come easy.
Geralt|Seems Dettlaff had made friends with him. Still killed him and chopped up his corpse.
Geralt|Then he was overcome with fury, remorse. Cut off the hand that had committed the murder.
Regis|Hm. Interesting. And entirely unlike the Dettlaff I know. See anything else?
Geralt|There was something, showed up twice in the vision - a bootblack's stand. Dettlaff first met de la Croix there. Went back after the murder, actually…
Regis|Peculiar…
Geralt|Stand was somewhere in the port district. And the bootblack acted as if he knew Dettlaff.
Regis|Hm. That would be even odder…
Regis|Perhaps we should have a chat with the lad, though I would expect no breakthroughs.
Geralt|It's our only lead. I'll go talk to him. Coming with?
Regis|I shall join you later, if it's no trouble. I don't yet feel strong enough to venture out.
Geralt|That's fair. Rest up. Be back as soon as I learn anything.
Geralt|Feel like I've seen the boy - the bootblack. Ran into him somewhere in the port district.
Geralt|And it seemed like he knew Dettlaff in the vision.
Geralt|Saw a moment - de la Croix did something selfless, was kind to Dettlaff… Guess it could've been the start of their friendship…
Regis|Why the uncertainty?
Geralt|Nothing extraordinary about it. Normal, everyday situation, really. Visions were supposed to issue from strong emotions.
Regis|Clearly the situation provoked such emotions in Dettlaff. Keep in mind, he did later murder de la Croix.
Regis|Killing someone who's grown dear to us, it's bound to elicit strong emotion. Vampires are no different in that regard.
Regis|Did you see anything else?
Geralt|Never expected it to be like that. You didn't tell me.
Regis|We need not discuss it.
Geralt|But we do. 'Cause if I'd known you were going to subject yourself to torture--
Regis|What would you have done?
Geralt|Found Dettlaff some other way.
Regis|I did not wish you to use any other way. Did that occur to you?
Geralt|No, 'cause I thought no being would ever willingly subject itself to that kind of pain. You vampires aren't any different from us in that regard.
Regis|I told you, the pain is my way of paying my debt - the enormous debt I owe Dettlaff. If I had to do it again… I would, in a heartbeat.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Excuse me.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|I shall only take a moment.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|You jumped the queue, sir.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|But Count, sir! You must understand… I've a… meeting… the council…
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Sir! You were next! Please, take a seat!
Toussaint Noble Man 02|This gentleman was here first. Step down, or you shall regret it.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Ahhh… failed to realize he was your friend, Count.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|It was then I ordered him to give up his seat and step off the stand. If only you'd seen his face! We got him good, didn't we, Dettlaff?
Toussaint Noble Man 02|And then mother insisted we buy the mill! Hah, curious, eh?
Toussaint Noble Man 02|But at least I've a yarn to spin for friends and associates.
Dettlaff|Forgive me.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|What…?
Dettlaff|Aa! Aa! Aargh! Aaaarrrgghhh!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Peasant Man 01|I just hope no one sees us.
Toussaint Peasant Man 02|Calm down.
Toussaint Peasant Man 03|But if they do? See us with all this flour?
Toussaint Peasant Man 02|What of it? Is flour a banned substance these days?
Toussaint Peasant Man 01|Confound it, just as I thought! I knew someone would spy us.
Toussaint Peasant Man 02|We must make sure he doesn't leave with the news.
Toussaint Peasant Man 03|Conk him out! Toss him in the river!
Geralt|Could find some evidence here, shed more light on what happened.
Geralt|A notice… De la Croix was out to sell, the mill and adjoining lands.
Geralt|Footprints lead upstairs… No peasant's boots made these.
Geralt|Blood, lots of it… Not all human, either. So this is where Dettlaff lost his hand. And where he quartered de la Croix.
Geralt|Definitely the scene of the crime. Not likely to learn much else here, though.
Geralt|Mill from the vision. Where Dettlaff killed de la Croix.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Bandit Strong 03|So how would you explain it?! Whether it pours for a week or the sun bakes our pates, we've always mud up to our ankles here!
Toussaint Boy 01|You can't blame me for Beauclair's fickle weather.
Toussaint Bandit Strong 03|Fickle weather?! I've seen you! You empty your chamber pot in front of our shop each morn. So folk will dirty their boots, go to you to get them cleaned!
Toussaint Boy 01|A far-fetched conspiracy theory, sirs…
Toussaint Bandit Weak 01|I'll conspire to welt your bum with my belt! Come here!
Geralt|Leave him alone.
Toussaint Bandit Strong 03|Just who the spit are you?
Geralt|His father. And you won't touch him. I won't let you.
Toussaint Bandit Weak 01|Oh, poppycock! I knew his father! A grifter, a cheat, just like his brood!
Toussaint Bandit Strong 03|I'll teach him honesty! He'll not leave muck at our shop door just to draw patrons to his own stall!
Toussaint Bandit Strong 03|So back away, drifter!
Geralt|Not gonna happen.
Toussaint Bandit Weak 01|Won't it? Well, then we will thrash you as well. Which is all the same to me.
Geralt|A witcher. And I'd advise you to go back where you came from.
Toussaint Bandit Strong 03|I thought witchers defend men from monsters, not cheats from justice!
Geralt|Need to talk to the boy.
Toussaint Bandit Weak 01|You can chat with him all you like - after we tan his hide! So stand down!
Geralt|All you need to know is, long as I'm here, you're not gonna touch the boy.
Toussaint Bandit Weak 01|Is that so? Then we'll come find him once you're gone.
Geralt|Try it, and I'll find you.
Toussaint Bandit Strong 03|Is that a threat?!
Geralt|Yep. Leave the kid be and piss off.
Toussaint Bandit Strong 03|Oh, no! No northern sheepdiddler insults us!
Toussaint Bandit Strong 03|We'll pummel the swine first, then spank the piglet! Get him!
Geralt|Bootblacks don't usually work nights. Need to come back during the day.
Toussaint Bandit Strong 03|Caught you, you little fart!
Toussaint Boy 01|Whatever's the problem, kind sirs?
Toussaint Bandit Weak 01|This mud! Rain or shine, it's always here! And now we know why!
Toussaint Bandit Weak 02|You dump your waste in front of our shop! We saw you!
Toussaint Boy 01|Oh my, sirs, you really ought to go easy on the wine.
Toussaint Bandit Strong 03|We'll break your legs, vagrant!
Toussaint Bandit Weak 01|Teach you to help scofflaws and cheats!
Regis|Not now, Geralt… I could not move a step without your assistance.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Obstructing my investigation.
Beauclair Bastard 01|Understood. Right, a few days in the clink ought to teach them not to impede official duchy business.
Beauclair Bastard 01|Come on.
Toussaint Boy 01|You're very good with your fists, sir. Wouldn't be looking for work, would you? We'd make a fine duo.
Geralt|Listen, I'm interested in a certain gentleman…
Toussaint Boy 01|Wait, wait. Before we get to talking, please, take a seat.
Geralt|Uh, prefer going barefoot, lately… but fine, have it your way.
Toussaint Boy 01|Step up, have a seat, you shan't regret it.
Toussaint Boy 01|So then, who was it you wanted to ask about?
Geralt|One of your patrons. Tall, elegant black frock. Not from around here.
Toussaint Boy 01|An arrival? Hm, indeed, I hear a faint bell ringing… A modest sum might make it sing out loud and clear.
Geralt|How much?
Toussaint Boy 01|Let's say… five hundred crowns.
Geralt|What? Gotta be kidding me. What would you even do with that kind of coin?
Toussaint Boy 01|Expand my venture. I'm sure you can imagine. Have a proper stand with a big sign. I want a new box, too, new polishes, new brushes… and if I've enough coin left, I'll buy a share in a launderer's, get wastewater for free.
Geralt|Hm, got it all planned out…
Toussaint Boy 01|I should think so! Capital is all I require.
Geralt|All right, let's see if we can't figure something out…
Geralt|No way, not about to contribute to your shady venture.
Geralt|You'll tell me what you know - for free.
Toussaint Boy 01|Yes, sir, of course, sir, as you wish, sir…
Toussaint Boy 01|I know the fellow you seek, though I don't know his name. A steady patron, gets his boots cleaned every few days. He's very good to me, always pays me a premium.
Geralt|Know where I might find him?
Toussaint Boy 01|No… but you could wait here. Perhaps he'll stop by.
Geralt|Don't have the time for that… Sure you don't know where to find him? Or, maybe notice which direction he came from?
Toussaint Boy 01|When I clean boots, sir, I do not look up to see where folk come from. I clean!
Regis|It seems you're having a rough go of it…
Geralt|Oh, you're here. Feeling better?
Regis|I am, thank you. The local necropolis - the air does wonders for me. Now, if I might intercede, I daresay I've the right question to ask.
Regis|Young man, do you see this vial? One drop added to your boot polish will help you wipe even the most encrusted boot clean as the dome of Saint Lebioda's Cathedral.
Regis|With it, you will serve three times as many patrons at a fraction of the effort. Earn piles more coin. I'm prepared to give you this vial… if you tell me where the man we seek lives.
Toussaint Boy 01|Uhhh…. But… you won't hurt him, will you? The gentleman's odd, true, but he's kind.
Regis|In point of fact, he's a friend. Yet we had a falling out of sorts and would like to straighten matters out.
Toussaint Boy 01|I leave his boots at the door of a house near the port. The door is red. But I do not know if the gentleman lives there.
Geralt|Worth checking. Might happen on a lead.
Toussaint Boy 01|Would you let me scrape the dirt off your kickers before you go? With all due respect, sirs, your boots could stand a cleaning.
Regis|Thank you. Perhaps later.
Geralt|But my boots're clean.
Toussaint Boy 01|In this city, no boots are clean unless they've just come off my stand. A seat, sir, please.
Geralt|Yeah? How you imagine that working?
Toussaint Boy 01|Splendidly, that's how. I suggest a partnership, where I see to the boots while you stand guard.
Toussaint Boy 01|And as you're the stronger, come morn you'd take the chamber pot out and help me make mud.
Geralt|Bit about the mud's true? They were right to wanna box your ears.
Toussaint Boy 01|I've got to make a living somehow.
Toussaint Boy 01|So, what say you, sir? Partners?
Geralt|Lemme think about it.
Geralt|Nothing, really. Had a little misunderstanding. Figured it out, though.
Beauclair Bastard 01|Uh-huh. I see. As the duchess' protégé, you may go. But this lot… that's another matter.
Beauclair Bastard 01|You'll come with us. Some time in a cell ought to scare the dimwits out of you.
Toussaint Boy 01|That's not even worth the spit I'd need to use to discuss it.
Toussaint Boy 01|Hmm… It's not quite-- I don't know…
Toussaint Boy 01|Out of the question, quite simply no.
Geralt|Fine, guess I can agree to that.
Toussaint Boy 01|A thousand thanks, I shan't forget it. Now, to the matter at hand.
Geralt|Here, your coin. Put it to good use…
Geralt|Just one problem… Don't have the coin. See if I can't get some, then come back.
Toussaint Boy 01|I shall patiently await your return.
Toussaint Boy 01|Ah! See? I knew we'd clinch it.
Toussaint Boy 01|Well, greetings, noble sir! Please take a seat!
Toussaint Boy 01|Tell me, good sir, have you gathered the sum we spoke of?
Beauclair Bastard 02|What's the meaning of this? The brawl - who started it?
Geralt|I'm investigating the Beast. On the duchess' orders.
Beauclair Bastard 01|Ah yes, we've heard of you. And these men - what are they doing?
Beauclair Bastard 02|What's the meaning of this? The brawl - who started it?
Geralt|I'm investigating the Beast. On the duchess' orders.
Beauclair Bastard 01|Ah yes, we've heard of you. And these men - what are they doing?
Toussaint Boy 01|Worked so hard I sweat blood, today. Now home, sweet home.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Attic. Let's go.
Geralt|So this is his nest. Need to look around.
Regis|I find these puppets rather disturbing…
Geralt|Nice tune.
Regis|Indeed. I'm not certain why, but it reminds me of home. Our true home, from before the Conjunction of Spheres.
Geralt|That Rhenawedd?
Regis|I don't know. As I said, I never met her.
Geralt|Reminds me of someone…
Regis|Who?
Geralt|Not sure. Can't help feeling I've seen that face before, though.
Geralt|Won't budge. Gotta break it down.
Regis|You might just as well stand out in the street, pound on a drum and holler, "Dettlaff, I'm coming for you!" A bit more finesse, I implore you.
Geralt|Let's hear your idea.
Regis|Give me a moment.
Geralt|Nice. Ever consider becoming a burglar? Skill like that'd come in awful handy.
Regis|I considered it briefly, but ultimately concluded it would be terribly dull.
Regis|Come.
Geralt|He here? Sense him?
Regis|*Sniff* No. He's not here. But he was here recently, his scent is still strong.
Geralt|Let's look around.
Regis|Even if he's not here, surely he's left behind some clue as to his whereabouts.
Regis|This is no time for idle chatter. We must find Dettlaff.
Geralt|Woman's likeness… Bit smudged.
Geralt|This his lover?
Regis|I don't rightly know.
Geralt|Old toy. No use to anyone. Shame, must've brought someone joy, sometime.
Geralt|Hm. Sombody fixed this recently.
Geralt|No dust mark. Somebody moved this here recently.
Geralt|Tools were used recently. Dettlaff unwind by fixing toys between murders?
Regis|Really, now, Geralt, must you?
Regis|Where've you gone? Geralt, we've not finished yet. Argh, I expect you to return.
Geralt|Nice little trinket.
Geralt|Sometimes I think I might end up like one of these toys…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|All of it written using the same ink.
Geralt|See the color? Ink was dyed with cinnabarite. Rare mineral, pretty much found only in…
Regis|Nazair. But I fear it means very little - anyone could have imported such ink.
Geralt|Fair enough. Still worth remembering.
Regis|Look, this slip is stained.
Geralt|With wine. Not much to go on, either - especially not in Beauclair.
Regis|Perhaps… Yet perhaps also worth remembering.
Geralt|Still got nothing, basically. Need to look around some more.
Regis|Let's get to work.
Geralt|Dettlaff's handwriting - seen many samples?
Regis|A handful. But mind telling me why you ask?
Geralt|Listen, I know you wanna believe he's somehow not responsible, but maybe you're just wrong. Could be he himself wrote those names out, stained that slip with wine…
Regis|No, Geralt. I know him. In a fit of rage, out of passion - I could believe he could kill. But murder, a series, no less, planned out? It's simply not him.
Regis|A hideout in the city, learning his victim's habits, noting down their names… No. Someone is controlling him. Of this I am certain.
Geralt|Let's sum up what we know.
Geralt|Seems Dettlaff's being blackmailed. Someone's been feeding him his victims' names.
Regis|All noted down using one and the same Nazairi ink. And not in his handwriting.
Geralt|Not much…
Regis|But enough to ascertain Dettlaff's innocence. Clearly.
Geralt|Actually, it is. Dettlaff's being manipulated. Some lunatic's turned him into a tool, making him kill.
Regis|So it would seem… But this illuminates a path of action for us. We must find Rhenawedd, render the blackmail senseless. The lunatic or tics will thus lose hold on Dettlaff.
Geralt|That's one idea…
Geralt|Hm. Could be worth a shot, but… what about Dettlaff? He gonna go on killing while I'm out searching for his lover?
Regis|He will not. I shall convince him to stay his hand, assure him you're a friend seeking to help. I'll await him here - he's sure to return sooner or later.
Geralt|Think he'll listen?
Regis|He will.
Geralt|Oughta wait with you, maybe.
Regis|No. He'll sense you from a mile off, simply fail to appear. I'd better stay alone, you must trust me on this.
Geralt|Fine. Need to report to the duchess, first.
Regis|So be it. We'll await you here. Dettlaff and I both.
Geralt|Not how I'd put it. Doubt it's how the duchess will see it, either.
Regis|I trust you to convince her. And then…
Geralt|What? Go on, don't be shy. See you've got all figured out. Including the grin I gotta wear.
Regis|It's a rather bold plan, but… were we to find Rhenawedd, we would strip the blackmailers of their hold on Dettlaff.
Geralt|Blackmailer - kinda curious who it could be…
Regis|Why is that?
Geralt|Regis… Somebody kidnapped a vampire's lover - bold to begin with. Now they're forcing the vampire to kill, a vampire you yourself insist is no murderer. Blackmailer's skilled, someone special.
Regis|Hm. Astute. Now that I think of it, I'm beginning to wonder if…
Geralt|It's not one of your kind? Another vampire?
Regis|Precisely. The plot thickens.
Geralt|Just a hypothesis. Wouldn't set my heart on it till we know more.
Regis|Right you are.
Geralt|Who's Rhenawedd?
Regis|His one-time lover. The sole human woman with whom he was very close.
Regis|Because she accepted him. With her aid and care, he found a place for himself in this hostile world. She began the work that I strive to continue.
Geralt|Ever meet her?
Regis|Never had the pleasure, alas. She deserted him a time before he came round to save me. Though he always claimed she'd gone missing.
Geralt|Take it you have your doubts.
Regis|I know humans better than he does. Their capacity to be disloyal, dishonest. I also know she took her things - not something one associates with the kidnapped or those who disappear against their will.
Regis|I'll save you the trouble of asking - no, I don't know why she left. I can, however, hazard a guess that Dettlaff grew angry one day, showed another, more monstrous side. Dettlaff's anger could frighten anyone off, though most who see it get no chance to flee.
Geralt|Dettlaff have trouble letting go, accepting that she'd left him?
Regis|Is that so hard to believe? Do you know no humans who've struggled with just such a thing? And Dettlaff is so much more emotional than most humans.
Regis|Not only was she his beloved, his lover, his mate. She was a member of his pack. And one never leaves one's pack voluntarily.
Geralt|Even if Rhenawedd did abandon him that time, looks like someone's actually kidnapped her this time.
Regis|Hard to argue with that. And hard to foresee what he's prepared to do to free her, get her back.
Geralt|He's prepared to kill, that's clear.
Regis|As would you be for Yennefer. He kills for he cares for her deeply, and that blood, those individuals… they mean nothing to him.
Geralt|Yeah, I get it now. He's out to rescue a female from his pack.
Regis|Exactly.
Geralt|Right, so someone's blackmailing him - we know that. Still have no idea who. Need to look around some more.
Geralt|Dettlaff ever try to find her? I mean, if she was that important…
Geralt|Higher vampires have their ways. All kinds. Should've been easy as pie for him.
Regis|Geralt, as you rightly noted, we are vampires, not miracle workers.
Regis|He searched, for months on end before giving up. Clearly Rhenawedd knew him all too well, enough to cover her tracks, leave no way for him to find her.
Geralt|Why'd he think that? Any signs or clues to that effect?
Regis|None to be found. Apparently she disappeared one day. Her belongings disappeared with her. Not a scenario one associates with kidnapping. In my humble opinion, she left on her own, scared off, perhaps, by a bout of Dettlaff's rage that revealed his other, more monstrous side.
Geralt|Dettlaff van der Eretein, you do not know us, but we know you… to be a vampire. We know also of your weakness for the wench they call Rhenawedd.
Geralt|Now you know this. We shall chain her down and let rats feed on her. We shall flay the skin from her flesh… Yet you can save her. You need but travel to Beauclair, where you shall slay five men in the manner we prescribe.
Geralt|You must complete the killing in three days. Fail, and the next letter you receive will contain a memento of your failure - your beloved's finger.
Regis|There you have it. Proof positive Dettlaff killed not of his own accord. A blackmailer's sunk his claws into him.
Geralt|Any idea what it could be? Dettlaff have any enemies?
Regis|Indeed, Dettlaff gains foes occasionally, but they never live long.
Geralt|One might've managed to evade him.
Regis|Possible in theory… but I know of none. It would have to be someone devilishly dangerous. As you well know, having faced Dettlaff yourself.
Regis|Whoever it is, it is someone new.
Geralt|Look, slips of paper, name on each…
Geralt|Count Crespi, Count du Lac, Milton de Peyrac-Peyran, Count de la Croix…
Regis|Dettlaff's victims, one and all. But that's not his hand.
Geralt|Must've come from whoever wrote the letter.
<|endoftext|>
Damien|Your Grace, I have doubled the guard. The palace is secure.
Anna Henrietta|Mhm… And what of the funeral preparations?
Damien|As Your Grace wished, the deceased will be buried with the highest honors.
Damien|And our dearly departed Milton de Peyrac-Peyran shall posthumously receive the Order of Ademarta…
Damien|Your Grace… this might not be the best idea.
Anna Henrietta|I've made my decision. Prepare to depart.
Geralt|Case is more serious than we thought. The Beast - I couldn't kill it, didn't manage.
Anna Henrietta|We send you after a monster, and you return with nothing? We are very disappointed.
Geralt|Situation's not quite that simple. Beast's a powerful vampire.
Damien|Pfff, is this a problem? Is it too much for a witcher? A monster slayer?  But everyone knows how to end a vampire. Draw him by trick into sunlight. Or arm yourself with ample garlic and drive a stake through its heart.
Geralt|Garlic's useless against vampires. Sun and stakes don't hurt 'em, either. Those methods - pure invention, only work in legends and fables.
Anna Henrietta|And buckthorn? When I was a child, grandmama Ademarta always claimed buckthorn drives off vampires.
Geralt|Silver sword's your best option for keeping them at bay. But it won't get the job done - 'cause only a higher vampire can truly kill another of its kind.
Damien|Excuses… Your Grace, I shall assemble a battue, bring the matter to its end at once. The witcher need but tell us where to find this monster.
Geralt|Whoa, this is work for a witcher, not for your guardsmen.
Damien|Yet when a witcher fails, my guardsmen must step in. I'll take my best - forty hardened veterans. No vampire can stand up to that.
Geralt|Forty, fifty, a hundred - doesn't matter. Won't make any difference against him.
Damien|You have not seen my guardsmen in action.
Geralt|Can they fight fog? Hit a target that moves faster than the wind?
Anna Henrietta|How… what creature can do such things?
Geralt|Creatures like this one. Higher vampires, we call them. Each one's a little different… unique or exceptional, you might say.
Geralt|Some transform into giant bats, others communicate with animals, command them.
Damien|Yet all are still brainless beasts.
Geralt|Dead wrong. Thinking of lesser vampires - alps, ekimmaras, katakans, for instance. They're ruled by instinct, sure. Attack anything that smells of blood. Higher vampires? They think. They employ reason.
Damien|Monsters driven by reason… A curious contention. What, then, do you intend to do?
Geralt|Try to talk to him - that's our best bet.
Damien|I cannot believe this… Her Grace summons a witcher to kill a monster. Instead, he wishes to chat with it!
Geralt|Know what I'm doing. His lover was kidnapped. He's being blackmailed.
Anna Henrietta|Blackmailed? Be so kind as to explain how a vampire might be blackmailed.
Geralt|Higher vampires, they're like us - motivated by emotions, not instinct. Not only are they intelligent to an extreme, they're emotionally… rich, capable of feeling many things. Even love.
Geralt|This one fell in love with a woman, a human. And he'll do anything to keep her from harm.
Anna Henrietta|You do not, I trust, suggest we let Milton's killer go free? Or wait until it murders again? We must render it harmless as quickly as possible.
Geralt|I'll find the blackmailer, free the vampire's lover.
Anna Henrietta|You were to destroy him, not help him.
Geralt|No one else should die - that's most important. Soon as the woman's safe, he'll have no more reason to kill.
Anna Henrietta|Hmm… I admit to being swayed, witcher. You may be right… Do you know anything about the blackmailer?
Geralt|Got one lead - a few scraps of paper. Blackmailer wrote the names of the vampire's victims on them.
Geralt|One of them's stained - a drop of wine, looks like… So damn little to go on.
Anna Henrietta|You've no idea how wrong you are, my dear. Send for the ducal sommelier! Hop, hop!
Anna Henrietta|In Toussaint, wine is sacred. Here there is no such thing as "a drop of wine" or stains therefrom. They are stains from a drop of Est Est, Erveluce, Fiorano…
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 02|Your Grace wished to see me?
Anna Henrietta|Witcher, show him the paper scrap.
Anna Henrietta|Benoit, can you determine which wine made this stain?
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 02|Mhm… mm, yes, yes… The west bank of the Sansretour, that's rather obvious. Aged in barrels of Beauclair oak… Hue - deep burgundy, clarity - high…
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 02|It's simple. Sangreal. The 1269 vintage.
Anna Henrietta|That's… That's impossible. The wine is produced at Castel Ravello. Especially and exclusively for the ducal table…
Anna Henrietta|Perhaps some Sangreal was stolen? We must go to the vineyard, see if there's not been an incident.
Geralt|Wait… Your Grace wants to go with me? Out of the question.
Anna Henrietta|I hope you do not suppose we will sit on our ducal hiney and do nothing while our duchy is in grave danger?
Damien|Your Grace, what you propose is far too dangerous. The witcher should go alone…
Anna Henrietta|It pleases me to see you gentlemen finally agree on something, but I've made my decision.
Anna Henrietta|We shall go, accompanied by the best possible escorts - you, captain, and Geralt.
Anna Henrietta|We will travel incognito. We've no wish to give the court any reason to gossip…
Anna Henrietta|For the duration of this mission I release you from your obligation to adhere to court protocol. In short, from now on I am Anna Henrietta, not Your Grace.
Damien|Yes, Your Grace! Errr. Witcher, are you ready?
Geralt|Yeah, ready to go.
Anna Henrietta|Excellent. Give me a moment - I must don something more appropriate and concealing. Then we will be off.
Geralt|Need more time.
Damien|Make haste! Time is of the essence…
Geralt|Sangreal - never heard of it.
Anna Henrietta|It's highly unlikely you've ever had a chance to partake of it. As I said, it is only ever served to the ducal family.
Geralt|Didn't stop it from ending up on that scrap of paper… unless, Your Grace's sommelier is mistaken.
Anna Henrietta|In matters of wine, Benoit is never mistaken. If he says it's Sangreal, it is Sangreal.
Anna Henrietta|We must ride to Castel Ravello at once, discover what has happened.
Geralt|Which is why that's my aim now - to prevent further attacks.
Geralt|Vampire's only half the problem. Blackmailer's at fault, chiefly. Kidnapped the woman to control the vampire.
Anna Henrietta|And what do you propose to do?
Geralt|It's way beyond being some "monster." This is a powerful being that's walked the world for centuries.
Damien|Impossible. If so great is their power, why have they not killed or enslaved us all?
Geralt|Don't usually meddle in our matters. Mostly stay out of our way 'cause they don't care about humans one way or the other.
Damien|And they do not fear we shall wipe them out one day?
Geralt|Huh. They'd probably be pretty amused if you asked them that. They're well aware of their strength.
Damien|Then what can we do? Do you have a plan?
Geralt|Go ahead, send them to their death. Certain death.
Damien|To a lone witcher, perhaps. To forty of my men at arms, but another skirmish.
Geralt|Found the "Beast of Beauclair." Just couldn't kill it.
Beauclair Palace Servant Man 11|Geralt of Rivia, master witcher.
Damien|I was not mistaken. You arrived and trouble followed soon after.
Geralt|Step aside. Got a matter for the duchess.
Anna Henrietta|At last, witcher. We've been on tenterhooks! Did you catch Milton's killer?
Damien|We all await. You are holding things up. May we depart for Castel Ravello?
Beauclair Palace Servant Man 11|My Lord?
Beauclair Palace Servant Man 11|Yes? Have you any needs?
<|endoftext|>
Anna Henrietta|Panthers have attacked the wagon! We must help!
Damien|Stay back, Your Grace! We shall see to this!
Anna Henrietta|They were fortunate we happened by.
Geralt|Tell me more about this vineyard - Castel Ravello?
Anna Henrietta|It's the best in all Toussaint. An old master of the winemaking trade runs it - Fabricio.
Geralt|He trustworthy?
Anna Henrietta|He's held his post for years. There's never been a problem till now…
Anna Henrietta|I wish to know your thoughts, Geralt. The Sangreal stain - how did it wind up on the paper? Is someone from the vineyard blackmailing the vampire?
Geralt|Could be a servant, could be the steward… Could be the wine was just stolen from the estate.
Anna Henrietta|We shall know when we arrive. It's not far now.
Damien|This vampire… have you ever faced its sort before?
Geralt|I have.
Anna Henrietta|How did it end? Did you kill it?
Geralt|Didn't have to fight him. Hadn't killed anyone.
Anna Henrietta|Have you ever heard of anyone defeating such a vampire?
Geralt|Know of a man who defeated one, sure, but he didn't manage to kill it. Ultimately, only another vampire can kill a vampire.
Anna Henrietta|Save the poor souls!
Damien|Onward, witcher!
Damien|Why do you wait?! Save them!
Anna Henrietta|Geralt, why do you flee?!
Damien|Witcher, come back! You're to protect Her Highness!
Geralt|Done. Time to move on.
Geralt|Panthers. Travelers're in trouble. Gotta help.
Geralt|Calm down. You're safe now.
<|endoftext|>
Damien|We would not have made it far without Your Grace.
Anna Henrietta|The important bit is yet to come.
Geralt|The Sangreal - how many vineyard workers have access to it?
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|One might say only I do.
Geralt|Not like you make the wine all alone. At least a dozen others work here.
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|I see you've little notion how wine is made. Grapes travel a long road before they become Sangreal.
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|The workers assist me only to the stage of fermentation. I see to the maceration personally and let no one near the vat.
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|Workers, again, assist me during barreling, but then I seal the aging barrels myself. Each and every one.
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|The wine lies in the cellar, gains character. Once this process is complete, it becomes Sangreal. And as it happens, only I have the key to the cellar in question.
Anna Henrietta|We'll not get anywhere asking questions, I see… It's a waste of time.
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|Your Grace? How am I to understand this?
Anna Henrietta|Master Fabricio, we have proof someone's gained access to Sangreal, someone who should not have. Which means one of two things.
Anna Henrietta|Either you lie to our face or you are an idiot who has had wine stolen from under his nose and not even realized it. In either case, you shall answer for it.
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|B… But…
Anna Henrietta|Silence! And listen! I shall inspect the barrels in person, thus giving you time to reflect. When I return, I expect to hear answers.
Anna Henrietta|Remind me, where is the Sangreal stored?
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|In… in the main cellar, around the corner… I'll show you…
Anna Henrietta|I shall find it. Give me the key to the cellar and wait here.
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|Of… of course, Your Grace. Here it is.
Anna Henrietta|Come, witcher.
Geralt|Who hauls the barrels to the palace?
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|We've our own garrison. Guards who have served here for years and would answer with their heads for the wine.
Geralt|Some of this wine might've been stolen. Just a suspicion we have, but… any burglaries lately?
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|Burglaries…? Not to my knowledge. And a few days past I took stock of the inventory - all was accounted for.
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|The barrels lie safely in the cellar, I assure you.
Geralt|See no reason to wait. Let's get going.
Damien|We will set out now, position ourselves before you arrive. You take the cart and meet us there.
Geralt|Fine. When the handoff begins, watch for my signal.
Geralt|Need a minute.
Damien|Make haste. We await only you.
Anna Henrietta|Master Fabricio, I am very disappointed.
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|But Your Grace… I…
Anna Henrietta|You are a step away from losing your head. Speak the truth and you might yet keep it.
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|I… I admit it! I-I-I sold a b-barrel of S-sangreal… I beg you to forgive me…
Anna Henrietta|Why did you do it?
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|I couldn't resist… The sum they offered, it was enormous. I gave in…
Anna Henrietta|Is what I provide not enough?
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|I wished to buy back my family's estate. For here, nothing is truly mine. I've a roof over my head, ample food to eat, but… what is a nobleman without land of his own?
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|I shall tell you everything, if you agree to show me mercy…
Geralt|That's enough. Know all we need to know.
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|Your Grace… I beg your forgiveness…
Anna Henrietta|Get out of my sight.
Anna Henrietta|Captain, have your men take Master Fabricio to the dungeon. He must answer for his crime - high treason the charge.
Anna Henrietta|What now, witcher?
Geralt|We set a trap. Need to catch the wine thieves - Cintrian noble could be our blackmailer.
Geralt|Next transport - I'll take it to Fort Astre. Damien and his soldiers'll cover me.
Damien|For once, I agree with you. We will do as you say. Let me know when you are ready.
Geralt|Wine itself - how'd you hand it over?
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|We met under the cover of darkness in the ruins of Fort Astre. A dozen or so men came to collect. Armed men, the kind that stink of trouble.
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|I had hauled the barrel there, they transferred it to their cart, and we went our separate ways.
Geralt|That's it? That the last you ever saw of them?
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|They… That is to say, a few days past a messenger arrived. He said they wish to buy another barrel and… well, I've prepared it, have it ready to deliver.
Geralt|Who'd you sell the wine to?
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|A few weeks past at the Pheasantry a rich nobleman approached me. He called himself a diplomat, well-connected at court.
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|He suggested we embark on an enterprise. Some of his "clients" had offered dizzying sums for even a drop of Sangreal… He was to serve as intermediary.
Anna Henrietta|This man's name.
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|He never revealed it. He was tall, black-haired and spoke with a foreign lilt. He claimed to hail from Cintra.
Anna Henrietta|I've no Cintrian aristocrat at court.
Geralt|Really thought nobody'd find out?
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|I was a fool, very foolish. I beg you, Your Grace, you must forgive me…
Damien|My men stand ready. Say the word and we will make for Fort Astre. It is time to catch these wine thieves.
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|Captain de la Tour! We did not expect any visitors from the palace. How are affairs at court?
Damien|Doubtless you've heard of the Beast of Beauclair. Well, we've our hands full.
Damien|Especially since the rogue last attacked in the palace gardens.
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|I… trust Her Illustrious Highness was not harmed…?
Anna Henrietta|Kind of you to ask, Master Fabricio. I am well.
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|Your… Your Grace…? We were not warned. I shall order the salon prepared at once.
Anna Henrietta|That won't be necessary. As you can see, we are not here on an official visit.
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|Naturally. Might I ask, then, what has brought you to Castel Ravello?
Geralt|Came to see you. Got some questions.
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|In this land, it is seen as polite to introduce oneself before asking any questions.
Anna Henrietta|This is Geralt of Rivia, a witcher. He has come to Toussaint on my personal invitation.
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|Which is to say…?
Anna Henrietta|Which is to say I expect you to treat him with the utmost respect.
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|Of… of course, Your Grace.
Anna Henrietta|Did you hear that, witcher? Fabricio will be delighted to answer your every question.
Geralt|Wanna talk about Sangreal.
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|I am at your service.
Geralt|This is an inspection. We've got questions. You'll answer them.
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|And who are you, sir, to speak to me this way?
Damien|Where to, witcher? We've a mission to complete.
Anna Henrietta|We must waste no more time. To the vineyard, at once.
Damien|You call that escorting Her Illustrious Highness?! What were you thinking?!
Anna Henrietta|Captain, this is not the time for such complaints. As for you, witcher - next time, keep close.
Anna Henrietta|Witcher, hurry.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Full.
Geralt|This one's full, too.
Anna Henrietta|Ptooey! Revolting, bitter plonk!
Geralt|Could've gone sour while aging.
Anna Henrietta|Impossible. This is not wine, this is contaminated refuse that should never have made it into a barrel.
Anna Henrietta|The fact that it did was no accident, I'm sure…
Geralt|Master Fabricio - let's see what he has to say about it.
Geralt|Mhm… Vintner's log. Fermentation completed with no complications. Tapped above sediment line… Here it is - barreling.
Geralt|Hmm… everything lines up at first glance. Neatly and thoroughly documented.
Anna Henrietta|Then we must follow our other lead. Benoit said the stain came from the 1269 vintage. Let's find it.
Geralt|Found it. Stored in a nook on the upper level. Just above our heads.
Anna Henrietta|Show me.
Geralt|So, where do we start?
Anna Henrietta|Let us see if all the barrels are present. Here's the inventory ledger.
Anna Henrietta|Hmm…
Anna Henrietta|I've a feeling we'll find something awry…
Geralt|What if Fabricio's blackmailing the vampire? Considered that?
Anna Henrietta|He has his flaws, but I would never suspect him of such a thing.
Anna Henrietta|He's been very loyal. He owes all he has to me.
Anna Henrietta|His father frittered away the family fortune. He left his son an encyclopedic knowledge of wine, that is all.
Anna Henrietta|Fabricio lived as a beggar until I appointed him steward of Castel Ravello. Only then did he come into his own.
Geralt|Looks like all the barrels're full. Dead end, I'm afraid.
Anna Henrietta|Full, they are. The question is, are they full of Sangreal…?
Anna Henrietta|Grab a tap and a hammer. We shall open them one by one and taste.
Geralt|Ready. We can start.
Geralt|Right here - 1269. What now?
Anna Henrietta|Let's see if any barrels are empty.
Geralt|Wanna open them?
Anna Henrietta|For now, a knock will suffice. If you hear a hollow thud, we will have found what we seek.
Geralt|Sangreal. 1270 vintage.
Anna Henrietta|That's the wrong year. Keep looking.
Geralt|Sangreal. Barrels're dated 1268.
Anna Henrietta|Close, but not quite the right year.
Geralt|Mhm. Barrel taps.
Geralt|So?
Anna Henrietta|Slightly smoky, strongly tannic. Definitely Sangreal.
Anna Henrietta|Ptooey! Yuck! Hideous, sour rotgut. Clearly not Sangreal.
Geralt|Fiorano. Dandelion's favorite, adores it.
Anna Henrietta|Ah, yes, that sophisticated palate of his.
Geralt|Est Est… Think everyone and their mothers heard of this wine.
Anna Henrietta|Among the best in the world. Castel Ravello is famous for it.
Geralt|Got Pomino over here.
Geralt|Erveluce. I like it, quite dry.
Anna Henrietta|An excellent wine. You've good taste.
Geralt|Got the taps.
Anna Henrietta|Then get to work. Let's broach those barrels.
Geralt|Ready.
Anna Henrietta|Step aside.
Anna Henrietta|Mhm… I'd recognize this taste anywhere. This one is good.
Anna Henrietta|Those hints of spice - distinctive. This is Sangreal.
Geralt|Wooden hammer. For tapping barrels.
Anna Henrietta|Hurry along! It's cold down here.
Anna Henrietta|This one is full.
Anna Henrietta|Full.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Who hired you?
Wine Bandit|He… he'll kill me.
Geralt|Oughta be worried about me right now. Who is he?
Damien|Go on, man. Spit it out.
Wine Bandit|The Cintrian - that is what they call him. I've never seen him. But I know he mustered the men for this caper.
Wine Bandit|That's what they said. That we were working for the Cintrian.
Wine Bandit|I don't know anything else, I swear it.
Anna Henrietta|Take him away, throw him in the dungeon. He shall await trial there.
Anna Henrietta|Captain, we ride to town. Gather your men and seek out this Cintrian. Someone else must have seen him, must know of him.
Damien|Yes, Your Grace! I'll report to the palace as soon as I learn anything.
Anna Henrietta|I shan't return to the palace, our mission has not yet ended. The witcher and I will await you at the guard post near the port.
Geralt|Let's go to town.
Geralt|I'll join you. We'll meet there.
Anna Henrietta|We shall await your arrival.
Geralt|Barrels - where were you gonna take them?
Wine Bandit|I don't know…
Geralt|Captain, need that rope after all…
Wine Bandit|I truly don't know! Hornitz, the leader, only he ever knew where to go. But he lies over there, dead. That one.
Wine Bandit|The first barrel went to a warehouse at the port. But where this one was bound I don't know. I speak true. You must believe me.
Geralt|Wait… she here?
Anna Henrietta|I hope you did not think I would leave this to you alone? Especially when every hour could prove essential.
Anna Henrietta|This prisoner of yours, bring him to me. We must ask him some questions…
Anna Henrietta|Captain, do the honors.
Damien|Who sent you?
Wine Bandit|His name is dog. They say he ploughed your mother.
Damien|Once again - who sent you?
Wine Bandit|Your nan's lover! They call him…
Anna Henrietta|Wait… if he doesn't wish to speak, he needn't. I can think of several other ways he can be helpful.
Anna Henrietta|I'm certain the witcher will need bait to lure the Beast of Beauclair.
Wine Bandit|Wha… what?
Geralt|Sure can, fresh out.
Anna Henrietta|In that case, he is all yours.
Geralt|Captain, have your men find me a strong rope. Kind that won't snap when we hang this fellow from a tree…
Wine Bandit|R-rope?
Geralt|Live bait - great for monsters. Provided they catch the scent of its blood. But I'll see to that.
Wine Bandit|What…?! No! Crikey, no! Don't let him….!
Geralt|Stop screaming, save your strength. Got a long night ahead of you.
Wine Bandit|No! Don't let him…! I'll talk!
Geralt|Usually only take measures like that as a last resort, but in this case… think I can make an exception.
Anna Henrietta|Do as you deem fit. He is all yours.
Geralt|Not at all surprised. Expected she'd want to oversee this personally…
Anna Henrietta|The master's eye fattens the calf. You're beginning to understand that, I see…
Geralt|Is it just me, or did we agree you'd wait for my signal?
Damien|That was the plan, but…
Geralt|Great shot. Good thing you reacted. Can't say how that would've ended otherwise.
Damien|At your service. It was a good fight. We managed to capture one of the scoundrels.
Geralt|Let's ask him a few questions. C'mon.
Damien|Witcher, a moment… I was wrong about you.
Geralt|Well, had no reason to trust me. And I didn't do much to change that.
Damien|True, you are not the most endearing of men.
Damien|At any rate, I see the effort you put forth. And I appreciate it.
Damien|Let us go to Her Grace. She awaits nearby.
Geralt|Don't need to like each other. Just gotta do our jobs.
Damien|If that's how you wish to treat it…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Gotta nab the Cintrian. Seems we have to go to that get-together…
Damien|You read my mind, witcher. I shall gather my men, surround the establishment. Not a mouse will squeeze through.
Anna Henrietta|Out of the question! If the Cintrian truly does have men about the city, he will find out and escape once again.
Geralt|Duchess is right. Need to be careful. Best go there, blend in with the crowd.
Anna Henrietta|Precisely what we shall do.
Damien|We, Your Grace?
Anna Henrietta|Geralt and I. In that sort of company, the witcher could use my help.
Geralt|Where's the event gonna be held?
Anna Henrietta|The Mandragora always assembles at the same place - a residence in Hauteville. It's a very distinguished district.
Anna Henrietta|Geralt, you must don appropriate attire. Then meet me in Hauteville, in Mountebank Alley.
Geralt|The Mandragora - what's that?
Anna Henrietta|A club, an affiliation of local artists. Painters, sculptors, troubadours, and dancers.
Geralt|Never heard of it.
Anna Henrietta|They exude a mystique - consciously, I think - behaving like an exclusive cabal, artistic elites. Every now and again they mount soirées. Only wealthy patrons are invited.
Anna Henrietta|All arrive in elaborate masks, then drink and flirt.
Geralt|Used to it. Not the first time I've been hunted.
Damien|Must you always…? Now…
Damien|The port warehouse where the wine was delivered - we identified it, then learned who had hired it out. This proved to be a beggar, a stand-in.
Damien|We found him, he admitted all. A man had paid him to sign the lease, a man he met while begging outside the Pheasantry.
Damien|There, fate lent us a hand. A waitress recalled spilling wine on a nobleman who spoke with a Cintrian accent…
Geralt|What'd he look like?
Damien|Her description was not helpful - handsome, well-dressed, with a beard, no distinguishing marks. This could be anyone. But she remembered his female companion very well, as she recognized her.
Damien|On the Cintrian's arm was Cecilia Bellante.
Anna Henrietta|The singer? I've heard of her. She is said to be gifted, very.
Damien|The same. We went to her home immediately. Cecilia was not there, but we questioned her servants.
Damien|A chambermaid claimed Cecilia is to meet a Cintrian gentleman tonight. She'd invited him to a reception mounted by The Mandragora.
Geralt|Don't care. Down to business - you learn anything?
Damien|I will start at the beginning…
Beauclair Bastard 01|Her Grace awaits inside.
Anna Henrietta|Here at last…! We lack only Damien, now… I'm worried something might have happened to him…
Geralt|Captain seems like a man who can take care of himself.
Anna Henrietta|Perhaps he can, but this Cintrian appears to be no common bandit…
Anna Henrietta|He managed to steal ducal wine from under my guardsmen's noses. We only learned of it through a fortunate coincidence.
Anna Henrietta|And it was he who specified the victims for the vampire. One must be exceptionally confident to blackmail such a monster.
Geralt|Still don't know this Cintrian's behind the kidnapping and blackmail. Might've just handled the theft of the wine.
Anna Henrietta|Even if it's so, he then sold the wine to the blackmailers. As I see it, that makes him an accomplice.
Geralt|Need to find the Cintrian - whether or not he's responsible for the murders.
Geralt|Even if none of it's his doing, he could still know our blackmailer's identity.
Geralt|Besides, it's one thing to know who ordered the killings. Other thing entirely, and just as important, is why they…
Geralt|Someone's coming.
Anna Henrietta|Captain, why so long? We expected you hours ago.
Damien|This Cintrian does not work alone. We are fighting an organization, not one man.
Damien|Bandits attacked us, not a small force, either. One of my boys has a broken arm, another, a shattered knee… lamed for life.
Damien|And the word on the street is there's a hefty bounty on your head, Geralt…
Geralt|Sooner or later, everyone slips up. Cintrian stole the Sangreal - that was his mistake.
Anna Henrietta|Yet if we had not happened on the wine stain…
Geralt|You're right, we got lucky. Even so, still can't be sure he's behind the kidnapping, the blackmail.
Anna Henrietta|He's late…
Geralt|Relax. He'll come.
Anna Henrietta|There's something I'd like to know… How can you be so damned calm?
Geralt|Side effect of my mutations - we witchers rarely get the jitters.
Anna Henrietta|What if something has happened to him…?
<|endoftext|>
Anna Henrietta|Right… right you are. We must proceed with caution. Come, it's our turn.
Theodore|Madame, monsieur, an extraordinary pleasure to welcome you to The Mandragora's soirée.
Theodore|Tonight I particularly recommend you direct your attention to the performances prepared by artists of our community…
Geralt|We were really hoping to meet Cecilia Bellante.
Theodore|You are admirers, I surmise? I'm certain you will have ample opportunity to converse with her.
Anna Henrietta|It cannot be easy to identify anyone in this crowd. Perhaps you could help us find her?
Theodore|Hmm… I don't know where she is now, but I can give you a clue.
Geralt|Let's hear it.
Theodore|Seek the Koviri orchid.
Geralt|Meaning?
Theodore|Cecilia wears one in her hair. You shall recognize her easily by the orchid.
Geralt|Well, well… Dandelion's always complaining about artists being poor as temple mice.
Anna Henrietta|The residence belongs to none of them. They are guests here.
Anna Henrietta|Orianna, she owns this. Woman in the black dress. There, on the balcony.
Geralt|Got her. Doesn't wear a mask?
Anna Henrietta|It would be pointless. All would know her anyway.
Geralt|Koviri orchid, let's look for it. If we find Cecilia, we'll find the Cintrian.
Geralt|Tell us about these performances?
Theodore|This evening The Mandragora has the honor to present three superb displays of artistry.
Theodore|The first was a concert by Cecilia Bellante, a singer whose voice, were it stone, would surely be a diamond. Sadly, Mademoiselle Cecilia has sung…
Anna Henrietta|A shame… we would have loved to hear her.
Theodore|Luckily, you are in time to see the Great Kalesti, a master of visual illusions come to us from far-off Ofier.
Geralt|Visual illusions, interesting… And the third artist?
Theodore|The third and fourth - for they are a duo - are the Tuven Brothers, presenting their newest pantomime.
Anna Henrietta|Not all bad… Nothing like a budding artist, of course, but…
Anna Henrietta|Just one other detail. Here, put it on.
Geralt|A mask…?
Anna Henrietta|All who attend a Mandragora soirée wear them. If you have one on, no one asks who you are.
Geralt|Let's go, soirée's started.
Anna Henrietta|Mhm… Wise of you to hide your weapons. They'd not have let us in otherwise, that's certain.
Geralt|Any idea why they wear masks?
Anna Henrietta|Likely because they imagine it is oh so very romantic and mysterious…
Anna Henrietta|The truth is far simpler - this way no one can tell which drunken aristocrats are pinching the performers.
Geralt|Late… Now why's that not surprise me?
Anna Henrietta|Oh, Geralt, Geralt… I knew I should have taken you to the palace, handed you over to my tailor. What ever are you wearing?
Geralt|Sorry, didn't have time to change…
Anna Henrietta|Luckily I prepared for just such an eventuality. Here, don this doublet. Its cut is all the rage these days.
Geralt|Mhm…
Anna Henrietta|My, my, Geralt… Not bad at all. And you've even a mask… just not the kind required.
Geralt|Huh?
Anna Henrietta|They're a little different, the ones "Mandragora" members wear. I've brought you one. Put it on.
Anna Henrietta|Oh, Geralt, Geralt… I should have ordered you escorted to the palace, handed over to my tailor… What is that you're wearing?
Geralt|Easy. Got something appropriate, just haven't had time to change.
Anna Henrietta|Hm… Very well. Let's see it.
Geralt|You like?
Anna Henrietta|Well, well… I did not expect you to have such a sense of style.
Geralt|You like?
Anna Henrietta|Well, well. A witcher in a robe… I last saw attire like this years ago, in Redania.
Geralt|Inappropriate for this evening? Not a good fit?
Anna Henrietta|It's a wonderful fit, but you're sure to stand out. No one wears such things around here.
Anna Henrietta|How do we find the Cintrian? Have you a plan?
Geralt|Key is not to spook him. Need to ask after his partner, Cecilia, first. Less likely to raise suspicions. Soon as we find her, we find him.
Geralt|Especially since he might be expecting us…
Anna Henrietta|What do you mean?
Geralt|Ran into some of his thugs in town. Knew who I was, had it in for me.
Theodore|The Mandragora is honored to welcome you to another festive evening.
Theodore|Come in, come in… Our artists have truly outdone themselves this time.
Theodore|A pleasant evening to you.
Theodore|Enter, a night of fantasy and wonder awaits.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|*Sniff* Clear scent of perfume.
Anna Henrietta|Let's follow it. No time to lose.
Geralt|Empty heart-shaped box… Cecilia must've left it behind.
Anna Henrietta|It looks like it held a flask of perfume.
Anna Henrietta|A gift from the Cintrian, I imagine…
Geralt|Scent still hangs in the air. Let's follow it.
Anna Henrietta|She ought to be in one of the alcoves.
Anna Henrietta|Come, let's look in the alcoves.
Anna Henrietta|Let's look by the refreshments.
Anna Henrietta|We should walk past the tables, perhaps they're still there.
Anna Henrietta|Lead on, witcher.
Anna Henrietta|Let's not waste time.
Anna Henrietta|Geralt, we haven't the time, come…
Anna Henrietta|Get out of the water, we've no time to lose.
Anna Henrietta|No time for such antics. Come on.
Geralt|Someone left their lute behind. Looks a little like Dandelion's…
Anna Henrietta|His was scratched… someone beat him with it once.
Geralt|Hm. Love letter penned on a napkin… Look.
Anna Henrietta|"O, my amour, my sunbeam flittering 'cross the firmament of my life…" Treacly refuse.
Geralt|Hit of fisstech. Artists' way of numbing their existential pain.
Anna Henrietta|I do not even wish to comment…
Anna Henrietta|Geralt, where are you going? We've a job to do.
Anna Henrietta|Come back, we must find the Cintrian.
Geralt|Not here.
Anna Henrietta|We must look around. Perhaps we'll find a clue.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Do not disturb! Shoo! Shoo!
Geralt|Mhm… it's the right flower.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Of course it is! A Koviri orchid lends just the right contrast to her complexion.
Geralt|Need to talk to your model. It'll only take a minute.
Toussaint Noble Woman 03|To me…?
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Lie still! You may speak, but for love's sake, do not move!
Geralt|We came here to meet you. Specifically.
Toussaint Noble Woman 03|To meet… me? But… why?
Geralt|Cintrian noble you came here with - wanted to ask you about him.
Toussaint Noble Woman 03|Cintrian noble…? Ahhh, you must think I'm Cecilia!
Geralt|Orchid, confused me…
Toussaint Noble Man 03|I told you not to move!
Toussaint Noble Woman 03|As she concluded her performance, Cecilia tossed the flower into the crowd, I caught it… but I did see the nobleman.
Geralt|Really like to talk to him… What'd he look like?
Toussaint Noble Woman 03|Like many here. Tall, dark, masked…
Geralt|Know where he might be now?
Toussaint Noble Woman 03|He gave Cecilia a small gift - a heart-shaped box. Then they strolled off together towards the refreshment tables…
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Excuse me - madame, monsieur, I cannot work like this. You must leave. Now.
Geralt|Wow… Impressive portrait.
Anna Henrietta|I know the style, the stroke - this is Dorian Vilesse!
Toussaint Noble Man 03|The gracious lady has heard of me?
Anna Henrietta|I… I've heard Anna Henrietta herself wished you to paint her portrait once.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Ah, at one point the palace chamberlain even wrote to me, but, alas, ultimately refused my terms…
Anna Henrietta|What was the matter?
Toussaint Noble Man 03|When he learned I only ever paint nudes, he severed all contact. He said he would not dare offend Her Illustrious Highness with such a proposition.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|I've always longed to paint her… Such a shame.
Anna Henrietta|I think… you may still get your chance.
<|endoftext|>
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|We must throw off the manacles of form. Venture beyond the bounds of cognition.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Color is but the shadow of deliberations on the nature of existence. It is irrelevant to the work's ultimate meaning.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|I titled this sculpture "The Beast's Suffering." It represents the problems of contemporary man…
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Form exists in the material from the start. One must simply liberate it.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Do not touch the artwork!
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Pretentious…?! I was prepared for all sorts of criticism, but pretentious…?!
Toussaint Noble Man 03|So much time I spent polishing that one-man play…
Toussaint Noble Man 03|And Countess de Savelle was there - that's the worst… Now she will never look me in the eye.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Blah blah blah… Avant-garde, schmavant-garde - it's all about two things - coin and copulation.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|But are you sure it's an original…?
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|My employer swears it. Besides, have you not heard the news?
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Have I not heard?! It's on everyone's lips!
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Four de Touvettes in one night… the theft of the century.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|And here you are offering one to me…
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|If you are not interested, sir, I am sure someone else…
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Right! Fine! You can't think I'd let such an opportunity pass?! How much?
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|Slow down. You have declared your intent. Now I will convey this to my client.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|We shall get back to you. Please await word.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|As for that stipend - I'm sure you understand there are a great many highly qualified candidates…
Beauclair Citizen Woman 02|Then I shall have to convince you your ample generosity would be best-invested in me…
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Hmm… and how do you aim to do that?
Beauclair Citizen Woman 02|I shall arrange a private performance… After the soirée.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Ah, my dear… I sense you've a knack for persuasion…
Toussaint Noble Man 02|It's an outrage! Cecilia never should have performed tonight! You should have!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 02|It seems "someone" decided otherwise.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|That "someone" knows nothing of true art…
Toussaint Noble Man 02|It shall be you next time. Trust me, I shall have a word with Orianna personally.
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 01|Hear that? Another interloper on the balcony!
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 02|The absinthe's addled your mind… Deal the cards, let's get on with it.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Please leave. This is a private alcove.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Leave us be!
Toussaint Noble Man 02|We are busy.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|We wish to be alone. Please leave.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|To free a stone's subtle soul requires great precision.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Please do not disturb. One false move could prove ruinous to the entire communal effort.
<|endoftext|>
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Are they even? Because the right cuff seems somewhat higher to me…
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|It's fine, relax. Master Bouvaux is a generous patron and a truly wonderful man.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|It was thanks to him I had that exhibition in the palace gardens…
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Was that not just after you went off with him to Belhaven for a week?
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|Ehh… well…
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Exactly. I would rather not go anywhere with him, so I must make a good impression.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|But what if he doesn't come?
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|He'll definitely come. Don't worry.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|How can you be so sure?
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|Brother dearest… trust me. He promised me he'd meet with you, and so he will.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Noble Man 01|An artist naps in each of us! Come, toss a paint ball or two!
Toussaint Noble Man 01|All have the right to create! Cast some paint balls, discover your artistic soul!
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Good folk, yet another soul longing to express its creative side!
Anna Henrietta|Well, well… you and modern art?
Toussaint Noble Man 01|What a toss! What style!
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Voilà - fin. Now allow me a moment to ponder.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|My appraisal? The painting depicts spiritual dualism. The continual battle between good and evil. And defiance.
Anna Henrietta|Oh, yes, that's him, all right. Good versus evil. The dualistic nature of man.
Geralt|And defiance.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Superb! The composition!
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Good toss! It added some depth.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Come and express yourself! Besmirch the canvas and behold your emotions!
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Anyone can be an artist! Even you! Come, toss some paint!
Anna Henrietta|Go on, Geralt, be bold! Show us the artist in you! The paint balls - cast them at the canvas!
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|This is no game, no diversion. It's a paradigm manifested.
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 01|Paradigm, shmaradigm! Throw the damn thing!
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Shh! Silence! The artist must focus!
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Yellow? Why ever yellow?!
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|It's obvious! It represents transgression in its purest form!
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Purple… Quite the noble color.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Splendid… The sky over Toussaint before a storm.
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|Or a deeply internalized fear of intimacy.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Gods! Scarlet, crimson, oxblood!
Toussaint Noble Man 02|I see lips… Full, sensually parted lips.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|I've got it! It's the Sansretour!
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|It's not a landscape, you pleb! It's a manifestation of the man's soul.
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 01|Hiccup! Blue blotch is all I see.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|That green! Lush and verdant as a field of vines!
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 01|To vines! And to wine!
Toussaint Noble Man 01|The composition takes shape!
Anna Henrietta|Yes, it's sure to be a masterpiece.
Toussaint Noble Woman 02|It must be someone famous, I tell you. Such talent…
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|Exceptional, true! My, would I ever love to meet him… It's a shame he didn't come alone.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Need I remind you that neither did you?
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|Pff.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|This painting, it's rather… it's very…
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 01|Bloody colorful, that's what! Haha!
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Hrmph. Ignoramus.
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 01|A true talent! Paints like the Great Boiles!
Toussaint Noble Man 02|The Great Boiles? But… he's a dancer.
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 01|Umm… that's to say… the other Boiles! His brother!
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Good sirs, noble ladies, it seems real art requires time.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Clearly, not all are cut out to be artists…
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 01|An artist must have stones! Oversized stones!
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|Pff…
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Should you tire of these hues, drop them in the pail and grab a different array.
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 01|Wine, wine's what's needed. Wine renders all art digestible. Hiccup!
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Rather inspiring, isn't it?
Toussaint Noble Man 03|I do hope this soirée concludes more civilly than the last.
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|You look to me an artist of immense talent.
Toussaint Noble Woman 02|Artistry through brutality. Pellets that rupture upon striking a canvas. Deeply moving.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Yes? How might I assist you?
<|endoftext|>
Beauclair Thug Strong 01|Sorry. Artists in The Mandragora, and their guests, only.
Beauclair Thug Strong 01|Please go.
Beauclair Thug Strong 01|Sorry, only artists in The Mandragora allowed.
Anna Henrietta|Come, we must consider what to do.
Beauclair Thug Strong 01|I… I'd recognize that voice anywhere!
Anna Henrietta|You… you must be mistaking me for someone else.
Beauclair Thug Strong 01|I served fifteen years in the palace. Your Grace, I'd not mistake you for anyone.
Anna Henrietta|Shh! Not so loud. We are here incognito. On state business.
Beauclair Thug Strong 01|Yes, Your Grace! How may I serve?
Geralt|Looking for Cecilia Bellante. Seen her?
Beauclair Thug Strong 01|She's in her dressing room. Where she went with a nobleman. They clearly… were drawn to each other.
Geralt|What'd the man look like?
Beauclair Thug Strong 01|Tall, broad shouldered. A black beard peeping out from under his mask. And he spoke with a foreign accent, a drawl of sorts.
Anna Henrietta|That must be him…
Anna Henrietta|We must get to the dressing room. Quickly.
Beauclair Thug Strong 01|Yes, Your Grace! I'll take you.
Geralt|No, stay here. Anyone tries to flee, you stop them.
Beauclair Thug Strong 01|Understood!
Geralt|I hope we can count on your discretion…
Beauclair Thug Strong 01|Of course! I shall be silent as the grave.
Beauclair Thug Strong 01|As I said, only Mandragora artists allowed. Nothing I can do.
Anna Henrietta|Quickly! Upstairs.
Beauclair Thug Strong 02|Lady Orianna's guests only.
Beauclair Thug Strong 01|You can count on me.
Beauclair Thug Strong 01|I'd give my life for Her Grace.
<|endoftext|>
Anna Henrietta|That… that must be Cecilia.
Geralt|No pulse. We're too late.
Anna Henrietta|He… he slit her throat. The brute…
Geralt|Hmm. Didn't go out the door, guard would've noticed. Might still be somewhere here…
Anna Henrietta|You must find him before he harms another. I shall alert Orianna at once. She should bring her soirée to a close.
Geralt|Shouldn't split up.
Anna Henrietta|Geralt, I will be fine. Go after that rogue. I shall fetch help.
Geralt|Hm. Killed her, then went out on the balcony.
Geralt|Bloody hand print… Mhm. It's his.
Geralt|Tore down the door, made a platform. Clever. Must be pretty strong, too.
Geralt|Broke the flowerpot when moving the door… then stepped in the soil.
Geralt|Footprints. Made by soiled boots.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Bloodstains…
Geralt|Hunting knife, richly ornamented… Used during the fight, probably.
Geralt|Jewel was in the box, it seems. Cintrian tried to steal it, but someone got in his way.
Geralt|They fought, struggled, that's clear… Ended with one of them flying out the window. Fall had to have killed them.
Geralt|Jewel's still here, though, so our Cintrian must've been the flier.
Geralt|Could still be here. Need to stay alert.
Geralt|Precious stone, bloody fingerprint on it. Thief came for this, must have.
Geralt|Tiny chain links next to it… From a snapped necklace? Seems there was a struggle.
Geralt|Hm. Must've climbed this ladder.
Geralt|Canvas is cut. Somebody took a knife to the painting, looks like.
Geralt|Looks valuable… but it's not what he came for.
Geralt|Blood on the window frame… Someone climb out? Fall out?
Geralt|Locked. And no key in sight.
Geralt|Sconce is bent… smeared with blood.
Geralt|Someone try to grab it?
Geralt|Smashed mirror. Someone crashed into it, hard, then sank to the floor.
Geralt|Empty inkwell… Knocked over, turned toward the room.
Geralt|Jewelry box, lock's busted. Picked open, probably.
Geralt|Links of a snapped chain. Jewel must've been on it.
<|endoftext|>
Vampire Diva|So this is the tracker… A witcher, yes?
Anna Henrietta|Indeed, this is him. We found the body together. Then he set off in pursuit of the killer…
Geralt|And ended up here, but I've only found evidence of a fight… Seems the Cintrian's killed his last, finally failed this time. Shame it happened too late for Cecilia.
Vampire Diva|Poor girl… Always told her she chose her males badly… But I would never have suspected she could arrive with a murderer.
Vampire Diva|I'll alert the staff, have them see to her body at once… Meanwhile, we should sit. I will tell you everything. In full detail.
Vampire Diva|I caught him red-handed, attempting to burgle, rifling through my possessions.
Anna Henrietta|What did you do? Summon the guards?
Vampire Diva|There was no time. I feared he'd escape, refused to give him the chance. He stood with his back to me, so I attacked.
Vampire Diva|He struck his head on a picture frame as we struggled. He was bleeding, dazed… and then he drew a knife.
Vampire Diva|Everythin' happened very quickly then. I knocked the weapon out of his hand and pushed him, hard. He--
Geralt|Fell out of the window.
Vampire Diva|Just so.
Geralt|Jewel seems important. Why?
Anna Henrietta|The Heart is an heirloom, it belonged to my family for years… Then it disappeared. I didn't think we would ever recover it.
Vampire Diva|Seems someone is very determined to find it. The thief left his tool bag behind. Found this drawing inside it. Look.
Geralt|The Heart of Toussaint. Representation's pretty faithful. Cintrian must've been on a job… got very clear instructions what to look for.
Anna Henrietta|So… so it is not him we seek, but his employer.
Anna Henrietta|Is this the only evidence we've found?
Geralt|Also happened on the weapon he attacked Orianna with. Hunting knife, used to skin game. Got an emblem on its hilt…
Anna Henrietta|This crest is used by the lords of Dun Tynne. The present master of the castle is a passionate hunter… Our next lead, perhaps?
Geralt|Orianna, everything we discussed here, hope you'll keep it to yourself. Counting on it, in fact.
Geralt|Word gets out he, uh, failed in his attempt to steal the jewel, his employer could run. We need to proceed cautiously.
Vampire Diva|Discretion is in the interest of us all. I'll not ask what this is about, just as I expect not to be troubled about it again, by anyone.
Beauclair Thug Strong 01|Ahem… Forgive me. Madame Orianna, but might I have a word?
Vampire Diva|You must excuse me a moment…
Geralt|The drawing - it's on the same type of paper the victims' names were written on. Drawn with the same ink, too. Seems the work of our blackmailers.
Anna Henrietta|Who were not only behind the Beast's murders, but also stole the Sangreal and sought to steal the Heart of Toussaint…
Geralt|Look, the wine, the jewel - both tied to you, intrinsically. Coincidence? Not something I'm willing to believe.
Geralt|Worried about one thing - that somewhere at the end of this scheme, plan might call for an attempt on your life.
Anna Henrietta|It… it could be something else altogether.
Anna Henrietta|My sister, Syanna, might be among the schemers.
Anna Henrietta|She left court when we were children… My parents banished her from the duchy. I've not seen her since.
Geralt|Think your sister might be involved? Why?
Anna Henrietta|You see… I recall her always being rather… possessive, throwing jealous fits if I had something she didn't.
Geralt|Hear that's normal for sisters - rivalry…
Anna Henrietta|True… I suppose I gave as good as I got. There are times I miss that very much.
Anna Henrietta|The wine, its theft, was the first clue. That's very much like her - she always did enjoy stealing my toys.
Anna Henrietta|But I grew almost certain when I saw the Heart of Toussaint. Syanna received it from Father as a gift. At a time when my parents thought of her as but an ill-behaved little girl.
Anna Henrietta|Someone wanted some of my wine. The same someone ordered our family jewel stolen - or recovered. It's my sister, it must be.
Geralt|A fallen princess satisfying whims, going after lost luxuries… Hm, could be right.
Anna Henrietta|Your mission has gained new import. You must go to Dun Tynne and if Syanna is there, you must find her.
Anna Henrietta|No matter what she did, she is not to be harmed in any way, shape or form. You must make sure of that.
Geralt|I'll find her if she's there.
Anna Henrietta|I hope you do. I very much wish to talk to her… sister to sister.
Vampire Diva|Your Grace, Geralt, I'd like to introduce…
Anna Henrietta|Regis! What a surprise, I had no idea you were in Beauclair. And this is…?
Regis|Uh, my very dear friend, Dettlaff van der Eretein, an arrival from Nazair. We are lending our combined resources to the witcher's hunt.
Anna Henrietta|Ah, yes, splendid… But why are you here, at Orianna's?
Vampire Diva|They came to pay me a surprise visit, so I invited Regis in for a glass of wine. We've known each other for… ooh, ages, literally.
Vampire Diva|Witcher, I hear you know Regis, too? Even that you are… friends.
Geralt|Few I can rely on like I can on Regis. Kinda hoping he thinks the same of me.
Vampire Diva|Curious… It seems opposites really do attract.
Regis|Don't be fooled, dear. Geralt has many merits. He merely hides them from the world very diligently.
Vampire Diva|Mhm. You said you're both aiding him with his contract. It involves the Beast of Beauclair, I suspect?
Vampire Diva|Master witcher, maybe you could satisfy my curiosity. What's it like, going toe to toe with a monster? Knowing you've only two options - to kill or be killed?
Geralt|Despite what you might've heard, I don't lunge at every monster I see, sword in hand. Talking gets the job done for some.
Vampire Diva|Hmm. I wonder what a monster might have to say to you.
Dettlaff|It might want to apologize.
Anna Henrietta|My word. For what might a monster wish to apologize to a witcher?
Dettlaff|For killing. Though at times there is no choice. When loved ones are at risk and require protection.
Geralt|That's no excuse. There's always a way out, another solution. Seeking help, for instance.
Dettlaff|These other solutions often come too late.
Regis|You're well aware there are men… and witchers… who have done worse in defense of their loved ones? Am I right, Geralt?
Dettlaff|If I understand you correctly, you would rather help a monster than kill it?
Geralt|If possible, yeah. Or at least try.
Anna Henrietta|Enough about the witcher trade for now… Regis mentioned you come from Nazair. I spent time there as a child.
Dettlaff|Fond memories?
Anna Henrietta|It was wonderful. I was positively entranced by the land's fashions. Deep cut dresses I found most fascinating…
Vampire Diva|I believe we're running short on wine. I should go to the cellar, bring another bottle.
Geralt|Let me go. Wanna help, Regis? Know your wine a lot better than I know mine.
Regis|We shall return forthwith.
Regis|An exceptional conversation, don't you think? Vampires, a witcher and the duchess of Toussaint - my, my.
Geralt|Highly exceptional, Regis… Wanted to talk to you in private.
Geralt|You crazy? Bringing Dettlaff here?
Regis|Geralt, allow me to explain…
Geralt|No, let me explain. He's dangerous - and you were gonna watch him.
Regis|But that is precisely what I'm doing. Dettlaff believes you'll succeed in your task. And he'll not need to kill anymore…
Regis|That is, not until he gets his hands on the men who kidnapped his Rhena.
Geralt|Now listen close. Managed to learn where the blackmailers are. They're based at Dun Tynne Castle.
Regis|That's splendid news. If they are there, Rhena must be there as well.
Geralt|Duchess expects we'll find her long-lost sister there, too. Thing is, she might be involved, could be behind the blackmailing.
Regis|Do you mean to say your task now is to extract two women from the castle?
Geralt|Mean to say we can't breathe a word of this to Dettlaff. Who wants revenge above all else.
Regis|Geralt, you must trust me. I've got a way with--
Geralt|No, Regis. Can't risk it. Gotta keep Dettlaff here while I go to Dun Tynne.
Regis|Alone?
Geralt|Alone. That way I can make sure neither woman'll come to any harm.
Regis|I hope you know what you're doing… Fine. I shall see to Dettlaff. Good luck, my friend.
Anna Henrietta|Splendidly, Dettlaff. Ah, I'm grateful you brought back those memories.
Anna Henrietta|You're back. It took you long enough.
Regis|Contrary to what common folk believe, choosing a wine is not nearly as easy as it might seem. Especially a wine to be served to two exquisite ladies.
Anna Henrietta|Regis - gallant as ever.
Anna Henrietta|I regret all the more that I shan't finish this second bottle with you. Duty calls…
Vampire Diva|Your Grace, always a pleasure.
Anna Henrietta|I thank you for your help, it's been invaluable… Geralt, will you see me out?
Anna Henrietta|You have exceptional friends. This Dettlaff - an intriguing man to say the least.
Geralt|Didn't expect the evening to end like this.
Anna Henrietta|Neither did I… But I have not drawn you out for a romantic stroll. I wish to make certain you know what you are to do.
Geralt|Mhm. Gotta go to Dun Tynne.
Anna Henrietta|I've decided my guardsmen will support you. You will meet them at Count de la Croix's mill.
Anna Henrietta|It stands along the Sansretour River, near the Cockatrice Inn.
Anna Henrietta|Captain de la Tour and his men will await you there at midnight. You shall storm the castle together.
Geralt|I know the place.
Geralt|Don't know him too well. He say much about himself?
Anna Henrietta|Not much, but I've a good sense of the true nature of those I meet. I'd not survive a week at court otherwise.
Geralt|So what's his?
Anna Henrietta|Sensitive. Sad. He carries within him the weight of a terrible tragedy. He is a good man, but lost. Which is why he comes across as grim.
Geralt|Orianna… she really your friend? Can she be trusted?
Regis|I met her years ago, before I met you. And before she settled in Beauclair. We'd not seen one another in, oh - I can't begin to tell you in how long.
Regis|But I shall tell you all about her… some other day.
Geralt|Guessing it's no accident you two stopped by…
Regis|It would be quite some coincidence, indeed… No, a dutiful little bird told us.
Geralt|Mhm…
Geralt|Same as humans. Put them in that situation, they'll kill, too.
Dettlaff|You understand this… It must be why you and Regis are friends.
Geralt|Seem surprised. Why?
Vampire Diva|I never would've suspected Regis to find common ground with… a witcher.
Geralt|Can't guarantee her safety, unfortunately. Especially if she's one of those responsible for these crimes.
Anna Henrietta|Witcher, that was not a request.
Geralt|What'd your sister do to get banished?
Anna Henrietta|Syanna was… cursed.
Geralt|Parents run afoul of some mage?
Anna Henrietta|No. She was born at an inopportune moment. They said she was touched by the Curse of the Black Sun… Geralt, is it true? Can an individual be evil because they were born during the wrong lunar phase?
Geralt|Could be the case. Could also be because they were treated like lepers from birth - isolated, prodded, ostracized. Couldn't have had it easy, Syanna.
Anna Henrietta|She… she was angry at the whole world. She felt inferior, felt pain, though she masked this with confidence, arrogance, even. She could also be cruel at times.
Anna Henrietta|I recall one such situation… She persuaded Cedric de Coulbert that she could see the future in her dreams.
Anna Henrietta|We were children, and Cedric's brother was smitten with me. It was an innocent childhood crush.
Anna Henrietta|Syanna knew of it. She told Cedric of a dream she had had - that he would die… at the hands of his own brother.
Anna Henrietta|Cedric stole his father's sword and killed his brother. She destroyed two lives with the prank - Cedric mourns to this day.
Anna Henrietta|In the end, they forced her to leave the palace… A decade past, more. I've missed her terribly since.
Geralt|Orianna - any thoughts?
Anna Henrietta|Few make me feel awkward, but in her presence, I sense anxiety, discomfort.
Geralt|Dun Tynne… Remember the place. Abandoned ruin just a few years ago.
Anna Henrietta|More recently the family's last heir, Roderick, returned to his ancestral seat and restored the castle.
Geralt|Know any more about this Roderick?
Anna Henrietta|His grandfather was an advisor to Queen Ademarta. The family received those lands as a grant for his service.
Anna Henrietta|Roderick is quite the recluse. He avoids society, preferring the company of a small team of knights… Though the latter term is imprecise, as they seem more akin to vandals with crests on their shields.
Geralt|Claim the man was trying to rob you when you walked into the room?
Vampire Diva|Yes, he stood over my dressing table, pawing through my jewelry…
Geralt|Mhm. After this, is my guess. Picked it up while searching.
Anna Henrietta|Why, that's the Heart of Toussaint! Orianna, how did you ever come to have it?
Vampire Diva|I bought it. Many years ago. From a young woman.
Geralt|None too wise, picking a fight with an armed robber.
Vampire Diva|Why? Because I am a woman? In a frock, rather than plate? I can take care of myself, I assure you.
Vampire Diva|A hairpin might look like mere ornament… but plunged into an eye, it can be as effective as a blade.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|See you already prepared a plan. Walk me through it?
Damien|We have two objectives - to find Her Illustrious Highness' sister and capture the men who blackmailed the vampire.
Damien|Dun Tynne is a modest complex - several old buildings, a high wall around them. At the center of the enclosure stands an imposing keep, restored not long past by the elderly knight of the castle, Roderick.
Damien|We mean to strike here, through the main gate, then secure the area in front of the keep by storm.
Geralt|How many men defend Dun Tynne? You know?
Damien|Roderick maintains a team of knights for defense. They are no army, but they could number several dozen.
Damien|Also, Roderick recently took in a band of foreign mercenaries. About them we know very little.
Geralt|Need to hit them from both sides. You draw the defenders, keep them busy. I'll sneak in the back way, find the women, make sure they come to no harm.
Geralt|I'll vault over the wall as soon as you start your assault.
Damien|Your plan puts you at great risk… but I sense you will handle it well. Let us go.
Geralt|Cintrian's men, gotta be. Ran into a few in town - they tried to kill me.
Damien|Geralt, good you're here. Ready to attack Dun Tynne?
Geralt|Need a bit longer.
Damien|Do not tarry. Time is not our friend.
Damien|So? Ready for the assault?
Geralt|I'm early. No guardsmen yet.
Damien|We must get to the keep quickly. Here, this way.
Damien|Remember, we must find and rescue Her Grace's sister. Not a hair on her head is to be harmed.
Damien|Roderick's men are not to be underestimated. They are few, but none will surrender without a fight.
Damien|So eager, are you? The mill, then. We shall discuss the assault inside.

Syannas Bandit 09|Borg, they're at the gate!
Syannas Bandit 04|How many?!
Syannas Bandit 09|They're too many! You cannot stop them!

Syannas Bandit 04|We did it!
Syannas Bandit 01|Someone's there! Houndies, get the rotsaak!
Syannas Bandit 01|What've you found there?
Syannas Bandit 01|It's nothing, I guess.
Syannas Bandit 04|So? Will you stay with them?
Syannas Bandit 01|Would you foeken rather die in battle?
Syannas Bandit 04|You could be right…
Syannas Bandit 01|Of course I am.
<|endoftext|>
Syannas Bandit 01|Shoot! No mercy!
Syannas Bandit 04|Got him! One arseritter less.
Syannas Bandit 01|There's one! They're all around!

Syannas Bandit 01|Nock, draw, loose! Repeat!

Syannas Bandit 04|Building a barricade. We must wait!
Syannas Bandit 01|What the d'yaeble's taking them? Go see.
Syannas Bandit 04|They're coming in the other side! There's one!

Syannas Bandit 02|Heeeeelp! They'll cut us down!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Gotta move on. Get into the keep…
Geralt|Gotta get into the keep…
Geralt|Came to get the horses. Probably ready to escape.
Geralt|Need to get into the keep.
Dettlaff Vampire|They shall pay. For everything.
Regis|Aaarghh!
Regis|Onward!
Dettlaff Vampire|Argh. Bandit lice…
Dettlaff Vampire|Where is she?!
Regis|Come, Geralt, we must hurry.
Dettlaff Vampire|Move, witcher!
Dettlaff Vampire|Witcher, we must find Rhena! Quickly!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Noble Man 01|What?! Don't let him through! Grab him!
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Mercy… mercy… I… I did no wrong…
Geralt|Nu-uh - kept the wrong damn company. Cintrian's men - where are they?
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Akh… akh akh… I… knew… Shouldn't have let them under my roof…
Geralt|Where's the hostage? The woman?
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Wha…? What… what do you mean…?
Toussaint Noble Man 01|I… know nothing about a hostage… Must… must be the handiwork… of my… "guests."
Toussaint Noble Man 01|What… what will become… of me?
Geralt|Hmm…
Geralt|Here. Press it against the wound. Should stanch the bleeding.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|I… I thank you.
Geralt|Leaving you to the Ducal Guard. If you don't bleed to death in the meantime.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Ptooey! A pox upon you…!
Geralt|Where're they now?
Toussaint Noble Man 01|In… in the keep… Readying their escape.
Geralt|There someone with them? Woman named Syanna?
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Of… of course… She… she convinced me… to let them in.
Geralt|And a whole pile of trouble along with them. Where is she?
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Pack… packing. We were to leave together… an… old fool… I'd have done… anything, for her.
Geralt|Where is she? In the keep, too?
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Y… yes. Her chamber is… in the tower… The top… floor.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|What… what do you want?
Toussaint Noble Man 01|I… I was a fool.
Beauclair Thug Weak 01|M'Lord! They've breached the back wall! One comes this way!
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Kill him!
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Faster! Load those crates on the wagon!
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Hurry with those crates! But be careful! If you drop any…
Toussaint Noble Man 01|That's almost the lot, we shall be ready to go soon… Where are the horses?!
Beauclair Thug Weak 01|Hugo and Belen were to fetch them…
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Go see what's taking them.
Beauclair Thug Weak 01|Someone's here! They've breached the back wall! Come on!
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Kill him!
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Go on, lads! Beat the bumbotcher!
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Surround him! Surround and kill!
Toussaint Noble Man 01|I'm a hard nut to crack!
Toussaint Noble Man 01|I shall show you, rogue!
Geralt|Gotta be Roderick… trying to escape.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Onward! No mercy!
<|endoftext|>
Regis|Now we need only find Anna Henrietta's sister. Where should we look? Do you know?
Geralt|Mhm… Ran into Roderick, Dun Tynne's lord. Told me where I'd find Syanna.
Regis|Then speak, and let's grab her. Time is short.
Geralt|Said she was in a room in the tower… very one we're in right now. Which, incidentally, looks nothing like a prison cell.
Geralt|And just so happens there's a carafe full of wine here. Bet it's stolen Sangreal.
Syanna|What's your point?
Geralt|Stop playing dumb. I know… everything. Your plan, that this was part of it.
Syanna|…
Dettlaff|Witcher, what is this?
Geralt|Sorry, Dettlaff. You've been had.
Regis|My friend, please… you must listen to what Geralt has to say.
Geralt|Never was any abduction. She faked it to be able to control you, manipulate you.
Syanna|You lie! He seeks to turn us against each other!
Dettlaff|Let… let him speak.
Geralt|Blackmailers? Pure fiction. She planned everything. You killed all those men at her behest.
Dettlaff|That… is impossible.
Geralt|Sorry, Dettlaff. She used you. Part of her plan.
Dettlaff|You will come to Tesham Mutna and explain all. If you do not, I will raze Beauclair to the ground. This I promise you. You've three days.
Dettlaff|I shall be waiting.
Geralt|Rhena's not her real name. This is Syanna, and Syanna is sister to Anna Henrietta, the duchess of Toussaint.
Dettlaff|Wh… what? What nonsense is this?
Geralt|Syanna was banished as a child… But it seems she trekked back here recently. Moved in to Dun Tynne and ran a vandaguild out of here.
Geralt|Sent a man called The Cintrian to Beauclair. To steal some wine for her, wine reserved for the ducal family. Cintrian led us to her.
Geralt|Caught him later stealing a jewel Syanna'd gotten from her father as a child.
Dettlaff|Hhhmm…
Geralt|Giving you one chance - to tell us everything, yourself.
Syanna|I've nothing to tell.
Geralt|He just fly off?
Regis|He did not wish to act rashly. He's gone to soothe his nerves.
Geralt|Think he'll do it - make good on his threat?
Regis|I cannot say. He can be unpredictable when fury consumes him.
Syanna|I shall go to him.
Regis|Come again? After what he just…?
Syanna|You don't know Dettlaff like I do. If I don't do as he says… he truly will destroy the city. He's more than capable of it.
Geralt|Conscience gets to you now?
Syanna|Better… Ahh, better late than never, right?
Regis|Well, it truly does seem the best option.
Damien|Your Grace, we must proceed with caution. Guardsmen saw vampires here… They could still be about.
Anna Henrietta|Vampires or no vampires, my sister is here. Find her.
Damien|Your Grace, that--
Anna Henrietta|Syanna… It's true - it's you! Sister, dear… what have you gotten yourself into?
Syanna|So concerned, I'm surprised! Is there an ounce of truth to it?
Anna Henrietta|You… you feel resentment, I understand. But I promise, promise we shall work through all the unfortunate matters of the past…
Syanna|…
Anna Henrietta|We will discuss them later… Captain, escort Syanna to the palace. I shall meet with her as soon as we return.
Damien|As you wish, Your Grace!
Anna Henrietta|And you, witcher, you have my thanks. I cannot believe my sister was so near the whole time…
Anna Henrietta|Roderick of Dun Tynne shall answer for treason and blackmail.
Geralt|Roderick got duped and used. Just like the vampire.
Anna Henrietta|A propos, were you able to establish who kidnapped his beloved?
Regis|We've discovered Syanna blackmailed the vampire, ordered him to kill those men.
Anna Henrietta|What… what nonsense is this?!
Regis|She is his missing lover. Staged her own abduction to force him to do her bidding.
Geralt|He was a tool. Whole scheme was Syanna's, she was behind it.
Anna Henrietta|You're mistaken, you must be. This cannot be true.
Regis|Your Grace… I know this vampire and--
Anna Henrietta|What? You know him? Who is he?
Regis|Dettlaff.
Anna Henrietta|The same who so recently sat at my table and told me of Nazair?
Anna Henrietta|Is there anything else you've neglected to mention? A dragon living beneath Mount Gorgon, perhaps? Is anyone else here a vampire?
Anna Henrietta|Where is he now?
Geralt|Waiting for Syanna. If she doesn't show up to meet him by an appointed time, he'll destroy Beauclair.
Anna Henrietta|He dares threaten us?!
Regis|Your Grace, we have three days to bring him Syanna and--
Anna Henrietta|Not a word.
Anna Henrietta|You have three days to bring me his head. No more secrets, no more helping vampires. I want what I'm paying for. The head of the Beast.
Geralt|He's no traitor, just naive. Let himself me made a fool of, paid dearly for it.
Anna Henrietta|Made a fool? Whom by?
Geralt|Your sister. She's the one convinced him to let the bandits into his home.
Geralt|Seems you've got some last scraps of honor left.
Syanna|It's the least I can do…
<|endoftext|>
Regis|Hm. How… how do your employers customarily react when you fail to meet their expectations?
Geralt|Depends. Peasants cuss me out. Merchants demand I refund their deposit. Whereas nobles mostly just release their hounds.
Regis|And rulers?
Geralt|Usually threaten me with the gallows.
Beauclair Bastard 01|Her Most Illustrious Grace awaits the gentlemen.
Palmerin|Your Grace, the population demands she be punished. Syanna's committed terrible crimes, spilled so much blood. They--
Anna Henrietta|Another word, Palmerin, and I shall spill even more blood. Yours.
Anna Henrietta|I repeat for the last time, Syanna is responsible for the death of many, true… but she is also my sister. We are bound by blood and by a shared childhood. I shall not allow her to be lynched.
Palmerin|Your Grace, I fear the masses might rise, storm the prison, pitchforks and torches in hand.
Anna Henrietta|Let them storm. They will not find her there. Syanna is hidden away, in a safe place… She shall await trial there until we have rid ourselves of this accursed vampire.
Anna Henrietta|Which, to judge by your miens, has not yet come to pass.
Geralt|Did what we could, but--
Anna Henrietta|My patience is at an end, Geralt. Where is he? Where is Dettlaff?
Geralt|Don't know. I lost his trail.
Anna Henrietta|Is this all you have to say?
Geralt|I respect Your Grace. All I can say is the truth.
Anna Henrietta|Ahh. At times I hunt foxes. Do you know how it works? The Ducal Huntsman releases the hounds. They catch the fox's scent, chase the animal down, and lead the battue to it - all within an hour.
Anna Henrietta|You, witcher, have had a week. The aid of my most excellent knights. Yet you have tracked absolutely nothing down.
Anna Henrietta|I've begun to suspect my beagles might have done a better job.
Geralt|We'll catch him, Your Grace. Sooner or later.
Anna Henrietta|I should hope so, witcher. For the sake of all Beauclair. And yours.
Anna Henrietta|But to the matter at hand. Have you managed to establish anything?
Regis|Your Grace, it seems Syanna tricked Dettlaff, used him to murder the knights who escorted her into exile. We have reason to believe that--
Beauclair Bastard 05|Your Grace… Vampires!
Anna Henrietta|What? Speak, now!
Beauclair Bastard 05|Vampires… they've attacked the city… Captain de la Tour defends the square near the boat landing… but… so many lives lost…
Geralt|Dammit.
Anna Henrietta|If it's war this Dettlaff wants, it's war he shall have.
Anna Henrietta|Geralt, get to work. This time I'll hear no excuses. Palmerin, you--
Geralt|Get her out of here!
Geralt|Then perhaps Your Grace should've sent a beagle instead of a witcher after the vampire.
Anna Henrietta|You tread on thin ice, witcher. Very thin. Wisdom demands you choose your words more cautiously.
Geralt|Allow me to point out certain subtle but essential differences between a higher vampire and a fox, or game in general.
Anna Henrietta|Truly? Like the ones between a pathetic quip and a treasonous offense? Watch your words, witcher.
Geralt|We're working to find that out, Your Grace.
Anna Henrietta|Do you take me for a fool?
Geralt|I… wouldn't dare--
Anna Henrietta|I care not one whit what you have worked on, are working on or shall work on. I'm interested in results. Which, thus far, have been nil.
Regis|Do you think Her Grace's nerves have been calmed?
Geralt|Doubt it. Rarely forgets, rarely retracts what she says… especially not threats.
Regis|Yes… Well, even I must admit Dettlaff's actions were highly inappropriate, reprehensible, even.
Regis|Are you upset?
Geralt|Why would I be?
Regis|Hmm, let's see… You're returning from your hunt empty-handed. No trophy. No new lead to boast of, then pursue.
Geralt|Upset's just not a sensation I feel. Ever. Mutations, remember?
Regis|Mh, yes, of course. The excuse you resort to whenever you'd rather not talk about something.
Geralt|Observant of you. So let's change the subject.
Geralt|What can I say… It happens at times. Especially likely to when the monster I'm chasing can turn into fog.
<|endoftext|>
Regis|In due course. But first, Geralt… I'd like you to consider the alternative. After all, you could fulfill Dettlaff's demand and liberate his beloved Syanna.
Geralt|Hm. So I'm basically stuck - either gotta give in to a blackmailer or fight him.
Regis|You know what I would opt for. Should we free Syanna and arrange for her to meet with Dettlaff, there's a good chance we'll all survive this ordeal, Dettlaff included.
Geralt|Regis… don't mean to put you on the spot, but I gotta know - say I do decide to fight Dettlaff, who'll you stand with?
Regis|Should you decide your sword is the sole solution, I shall not stand in your way.
Geralt|Appreciate it.
Regis|Certainly hope so. Now please tell me… what is it you intend to do?
Geralt|Crazy as the plan seems… I'll do it. I'll ask Damien about Syanna.
Regis|You won't make me beg. I knew you wouldn't.
Geralt|Slow down. Not promising a thing… Just want to get a feel for the situation to start with. Coming with?
Regis|Of course. Many hands make light work.
Geralt|Sorry, Regis, but… folk've died. Got no time to lose, especially not on some kind of peculiar therapy for bizarre couples.
Regis|I see… Alas.
Regis|You know what to do. You must see Orianna, ask her to introduce you to the Unseen Elder. She might agree.
Geralt|What'll you do?
Regis|Now? Whatever I can to limit the number of human victims to a minimum.
Regis|Should you learn where the Elder dwells, do whisper a word to the ravens. I'll come and help.
Geralt|Even though that could mean you'll fight Dettlaff?
Regis|Even though. Good luck, Geralt.
Geralt|No idea. Need to think.
Regis|Not an easy choice. Understood.
Regis|Permit me to leave you to wrestle with this dilemma. I'm needed in the city. I cannot stop what is happening, but I can try to limit the number of victims.
Regis|Once you've decided… and learned something, perhaps, whisper a word to the ravens. I shall find you.
Geralt|How would I got about luring Dettlaff out of hiding - if I wanted to? With the blood of a virgin?
Regis|You see, somewhere nearby lives an unusual denizen, one of the Unseen - ancient and powerful vampires, among the oldest and strongest.
Geralt|Mhm. And?
Regis|Toussaint is this Unseen Elder's territory. All vampires owe him fealty while they're here. He need but say the word, designate a time and place, and Dettlaff will be forced to appear.
Geralt|So this Unseen Elder - how do we convince him to summon Dettlaff?
Regis|We must find him, first.
Regis|The Elder does not see arrivals unless he absolutely must. But locals, Orianna, for instance… You know, she too is--
Geralt|Yeah, figured it out. All right, let's say she gets me in to see the Unseen Elder… what then?
Regis|I don't know. You'll have to improvise, I suppose.
Geralt|Really wanna free Syanna, hand her over to Dettlaff? Refuse to accept you consider that wise.
Regis|It's hard to believe, I know, but… Dettlaff is not actually evil, merely impulsive. He needs but meet with her, speak with her… and he will spare the city.
Geralt|Mgh. So say I agree to this, 'cause I might… still no chance Anna Henrietta will.
Regis|I do not recall ever suggesting we ask her permission.
Geralt|The meeting - what if it's nothing like you say? What if it goes sour… ends in a fight? Willing to guarantee Syanna won't get hurt?
Regis|It seems unlikely in the extreme that--
Geralt|Didn't ask for a lecture on probability. Need a simple answer - yes or no.
Regis|I vow that not a hair on her head shall come to any harm.
Regis|I trust I've dispelled your doubts, then?
Geralt|Not so fast. We're not done talking.
Geralt|Got serious reservations about this plan… Not least among them - we have no idea where Syanna's being held. You heard the duchess - she's not at the prison.
Regis|Hardly a reservation. More of an excuse. I'm certain you'll find her, you must merely decide you wish to.
Geralt|Hm. Could ask Damien. Duchess treats him like a lap dog, keeps him close most times. He might know something more.
Regis|There, you see? I knew you'd think of something. Bravo.
Geralt|Think Dettlaff still believes Syanna's innocent?
Regis|I believe he suspects something. He must. And he seeks to understand what happened.
Geralt|And for that, he's declared war on the entire duchy?
Regis|What can I say… Moderation was never his strong suit.
Regis|Syanna failed to appear as summoned. And… there. Dettlaff was not making idle threats.
Geralt|Seems not… Need to make some serious plans of our own, now. It's gone too far, dammit.
Geralt|Gotta find him, stop him. Question is how. We've tried everything.
Regis|That… is not exactly true.
Regis|There is a certain staggeringly dangerous, mind you, way to force Dettlaff to reveal himself… and incite him to fight.
Geralt|That so? Go on, then, lemme hear it.
Geralt|Regis… you mentioned there was a way to draw Dettlaff out, a way you've avoided resorting to so far because you thought it too dangerous.
Regis|Is that how I put it? Do forgive me, then, I've misled you terribly. The word "dangerous" is simply a scandalous understatement in this case.
Geralt|Regis, another inner monologue growing out of a personal dilemma. Just tell me how to flush Dettlaff out, force him to meet. Please.
Regis|Syanna failed to appear as summoned. And… there. Dettlaff was not making idle threats.
Geralt|Seems not… Need to make some serious plans of our own, now. It's gone too far, dammit.
<|endoftext|>
Regis|Hurry. Damien could be in danger.
Geralt|Or dead.
Regis|Do you think so? He seemed battle-hardened, more than a few scraps under his belt…
Geralt|Against humans, not monsters.
Geralt|Look. There.
Regis|We must put him down before he kills again.
Geralt|Never thought lesser vampires would heed a higher vampire's call and commands.
Regis|As a rule, they don’t.
Geralt|So how'd Dettlaff sic them on the city?
Regis|I told you. He's exceptional. He manages to bend them to his will, control them with his thoughts.
Regis|They'll continue attacking until he orders them to back down - or until he dies.
Regis|It's a massacre…
Geralt|Monster's still here.
Geralt|Damien? Damien!
Regis|No answer… but he's not among the dead, either…
Geralt|Another one… dammit.
Regis|Hm. He didn't suffer long, at least.
Geralt|Armor proved useless. Claws sliced through steel like through butter.
Regis|We must hurry. Each moment's delay means another death.
Geralt|Blow itself didn't kill him… Bled to death afterwards.
Regis|If we'd only arrived a bit earlier…
Geralt|They broke formation. Ran.
Regis|*Sniff* That scent… It's Damien's blood. He was wounded.
Geralt|Let's go.
Regis|They should not have come out to fight. They'd have done better to stay inside, behind locked doors and barred windows..
Geralt|And sat there, listening to the screams of the dying?
Geralt|Fell on his face, struck in the back… Tried to run.
Regis|They must have realized they could not hold this position.
Geralt|Hope they found a corner to hide in. Won't be anyone to talk to if not.
Geralt|Must be in the bank. Barricaded themselves inside.
Regis|The door won't hold up long. Let's get to work.
Geralt|Barricade put up in the street…
Regis|Pointless. That's no obstacle to a vampire.
Geralt|They didn't know. I didn't get a chance to prepare them.
Geralt|Need to look around.
Geralt|Gotta signal Regis, have him join me…
Geralt|Tell Regis to meet me in the palace. We need to get to the playroom.
Regis|Geralt? Care to come back?
Regis|This is not the best time for chit-chat, Geralt.
Regis|We must focus on Damien. Time's running out.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|In a hurry to get somewhere?
Vampire Diva|Very much so. Now be kind enough to step aside.
Geralt|Chaos in the city. Know what's going on?
Vampire Diva|Naturally. It's rather irritating.
Geralt|Need to, uh, see your Unseen, convince him to stop Dettlaff. Heard you could help me with that.
Vampire Diva|My, my. It seems my dear Regis needs to be reprimanded. He's become rather… indiscreet.
Vampire Diva|And you - there are simpler ways to commit suicide. A number of bridges you could jump off of, for instance.
Geralt|Just wanna talk to him.
Vampire Diva|Hahaha…
Vampire Diva|Talk… lovely. He'll rend your head from your neck, make shreds of you before you can open your mouth.
Geralt|Let me worry about that. Willing to do it or not?
Vampire Diva|Hmm… I, too, would prefer a city calmed, but to reveal so dear a secret to a witcher…
Vampire Diva|Know what? Come with me. I must tend to a certain matter. Then we'll talk.
Geralt|If I was talking to a human now, I'd say that every moment we delay brings another death. Thing is, doubt that moves you at all.
Vampire Diva|Frankly, not in the least.
Geralt|Where're we going?
Vampire Diva|Not far. You see, I maintain a kind of… shelter, just outside Beauclair. An orphanage, to be precise.
Vampire Diva|I've heard the birds whisper. They claim a terrible thing's happened there. Under the present circumstances, I must treat this seriously. I'm sure you understand…
Geralt|Mhm. Perfectly. Let's go.
Geralt|Orianna, I don't have time for that. Folk're dying and--
Vampire Diva|And I'm about to mount my horse. So either ride with me, or finish this moving monologue alone.
Geralt|Dammit. Argh, fine.
Geralt|Bloodbath in the streets… that's "irritating"? I'd probably use a stronger term.
Vampire Diva|Well, you know… I'm getting on in years. Not easily impressed. Takes a bit more to get me worked up.
Geralt|Yeah, suppose empathy's not something I associate with vampires.
Vampire Diva|I suspected you would guess.
Geralt|Wasn't hard. Not like you tried hard to hide it.
Vampire Diva|Should I have?
Geralt|Well, I am a witcher.
Vampire Diva|And thus my foe?
Geralt|That depends entirely on you.
<|endoftext|>
Vampire Diva|Time is short, witcher.
Toussaint Boy 05|Shhhh… shhh… shh.
Geralt|Must cost a small fortune, maintaining this place.
Vampire Diva|What can I do? I've a weakness for children.
Geralt|Meaning?
Vampire Diva|Meaning that I… Wait. Smell that?
Geralt|Blood.
Geralt|Look. The bushes. It's…
Vampire Diva|Arnaud! Arnaud!!
Vampire Diva|Arnaud?!
Toussaint Boy 05|P-p-lease. Shh. Ssshhhhh.
Vampire Diva|What happened? Where's Arnaud? Speak!
Toussaint Boy 05|Shhh. Or th-th-the m-m-monster will c-c-come.
Geralt|Easy, little man. You're safe now.
Toussaint Boy 05|I was so scared… s-s-so sc-scared…
Geralt|Of what? You can tell us. Take your time.
Toussaint Boy 05|I… I w-w-woke up because of the bells… then the sc-screams… I pulled my quilt over my head, so I w-wouldn't hear. But… they were so l-loud…
Toussaint Boy 05|And… something began pounding on the roof… boom, boom, louder and louder. Then Uncie Arnaud came and said… "Sit quiet… real quiet… shhh, shhh… and you'll be all right."
Vampire Diva|The whoreson abandoned them. Left them and ran away!
Geralt|What happened then?
Toussaint Boy 05|Bartez, Nieve, Maura… and some others… they ran out. My sister Anna and me… we hid right here, in the room.
Toussaint Boy 05|But Anna… she began to cry. I covered her mouth, whispered shhh, shhh, shh… Held her long, till she stopped.
Vampire Diva|You mean to say you…?
Geralt|Drop it.
Geralt|Think I know enough.
Vampire Diva|As do I. Something killed my children.
Vampire Diva|I'll stay with the boy. He shouldn't be left alone again. You… you track down this scum. Bring me its head, and I'll help you with the Unseen.
Geralt|Fine… See if I can't find a lead.
Vampire Diva|Excellent. Go on, get to work.
Vampire Diva|Come, little one. I'll sing to you.
Vampire Diva|Wolves asleepin' 'midst the trees, bats all aswayin' in the breeze…
Vampire Diva|But one soul lies anxious, wide awake, fearin' all manner of ghouls, hags and wraiths…
Geralt|Boy's hurt. Wounds need dressing.
Vampire Diva|Not to worry. I'll see to it.
Geralt|You sure? Got a lot of practice, just need a few minutes to--
Vampire Diva|Go.
Geralt|Who's this Arnaud?
Vampire Diva|The guardian. He ran the orphanage, with his wife… for a generous fee.
Vampire Diva|I don't see them. Can't hear or smell them, either. They fled. Left the children behind as bait.
Toussaint Boy 05|Uncle Arnaud told us to be quiet as mice… and the monster wouldn't come.
Toussaint Boy 05|But it did, it came.
Geralt|Monster. What monster?
Toussaint Boy 05|B-b-big… with t-t-teeth and… and…
Vampire Diva|And what?
Geralt|This is pointless. Won't tell us anything in his condition.
Vampire Diva|Speak. What happened here?
Vampire Diva|Birds all silent for the night,
Vampire Diva|Cows turned in as daylight dies.
Vampire Diva|But one soul lies anxious, wide awake,
Vampire Diva|Fearin' all manner of ghouls, hags and wraiths.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Claw marks… Sharp, hooked claws. Monster had an easy time climbing on the roof…
Geralt|Smashed against the wall… skull cracked. Died immediately.
Geralt|Head, shoulder and neck wounds… Monster attacked from above. Jumped off the roof, I bet.
Geralt|Throat ripped open… larynx crushed…
Geralt|Stomach wall cut open in three places. Damaged organs, arteries.
Geralt|Wounds're smooth-edged… claws cut through cleanly. Young, thin bones offered little resistance.
Geralt|Sliced aorta. Fang marks alongside… but they're old, scarred over.
Geralt|Gunk… Is that venom? Hmm. Narrows the list of suspects.
Geralt|Beast killed the children, but didn't eat them… Something scare it off? Or grab its attention?
Geralt|Snff snff. Smell's not blood. Need to investigate.
Geralt|Blood stains… dried.
Geralt|Paw prints. Bipedal beast. Walks hunched over.
Geralt|Venom glands, long claws, a bloodsucker… must be a garkain. A pack leader, an alpha.
Geralt|For garkains, killing's a pleasure. Kids just whet its appetite. Must've gone after the guardians, too.
Geralt|Mhm. Garkain and wagon tracks merge… Wonder if the beast caught up. Roach!
Geralt|Drove off the road. Horses must've gotten spooked.
Geralt|Time to summon Regis… Slip a word to the birds, he said…
Geralt|Those kids… Orianna kept them, like farm foul or livestock. Dammit…
Geralt|Shredded her… then licked up her blood, every last drop.
Geralt|Garkain ate its fill here… Probably holed up nearby to digest.
Geralt|Aha.
Geralt|Garkain caught up. Trail ends here. Need to look around.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Did what you asked. Children's slaughter's the work of a garkain. One of those summoned by Dettlaff. Probably supposed to attack the city, children's scent lured it here.
Vampire Diva|Yes… It carries quite a way. Its sweetness teases the nose, gets the mouth watering.
Geralt|Unseen Elder - where'll I find him. Talk.
Vampire Diva|His lair lies west of the city, across the lake. Look for a cave near the shoreline… and this stone will open a hidden door.
Geralt|Not gonna take me there?
Vampire Diva|I visit the Elder only when I absolutely must. You'll know why once you meet him.
Geralt|I'll come back for you one day. You realize that, right?
Vampire Diva|Hm. Then I shall keep an eye out for you.
Geralt|Orianna?
Toussaint Boy 05|Aaargh…. Ugggh…
Geralt|Release him. Now.
Vampire Diva|I thought it would take you longer.
Geralt|It will. Still not done. Got one more thing to tend to. You.
Geralt|The orphanage - your wine cellar, right? A larder for blood?
Vampire Diva|Tsk, tsk, tsk, I never said I helped these children out of the kindness of my heart.
Geralt|Go outside, little man. And lock the door behind you.
Toussaint Boy 05|No!!! Don't hurt her!
Toussaint Boy 05|Lady Orianna took care of us! She took us off the street, brought us sweets, sang to us! Leave her be!
Vampire Diva|You see, witcher? The world's not black and white, it's shades of all kinds. I drank from the children, true… but never so much as to kill. And I gave them a great deal in return.
Geralt|I run into dilemmas all the time. Situations where it's hard to judge, hard to know what's right, make a decision.
Geralt|This is not one of them. You disgust me. And deserve to die.
Vampire Diva|But?
Geralt|I'm in a hurry, and you're hiding behind a child. So you'll live this time. I'm letting you.
Geralt|Expect me to thank you? For taking such good care of the orphans?
Vampire Diva|You care so much for their well-being… Hrmph, amusing. How do young witchers fare? How many survive your Trials?
Geralt|Don't change the subject. Not about to let you.
Vampire Diva|Then get to the point.
Geralt|0x0012887c
Toussaint Boy 05|0x0012887e
Geralt|0x00128881
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|I'm a witcher, Regis. I don't cut deals with monsters, I cut monsters down. And I don't give a damn about the risks.
Regis|Hm, well… I understand. I'll not mention it again.
Geralt|Thanks.
Geralt|Time we were on our way. Listen, I need to sail there… Coming with, or would you rather float over as a puff of fog?
Regis|I'd not be able to talk as a puff. And, as you know, talking is something I very much like to do.
Geralt|Mhm. At length and in detail. Let's go.
Geralt|Need a little time to prepare, now. Wait here for me?
Regis|I shall await you at our destination, if it's all the same to you. So, see you… though, try not to make me wait too long.
Geralt|Ugh… fine, have it your way. We'll free Syanna. If we can even figure out where she's being held, 'cause--
Regis|I've looked into it already.
Geralt|Oh yeah?
Regis|Mhm. I managed to convince Damien to help us. He claims Syanna was last seen in the palace playroom.
Geralt|A playroom? For children? What'd the duchess do, lock her in a dollhouse?
Regis|Perhaps, I don't know. We must see for ourselves. Come.
Geralt|Ugh, you've worn me down, Regis. Fine, have it your way. Playroom - let's go.
Regis|Excellent decision.
Geralt|Time'll tell.
Geralt|Yeah, I know. You'd still prefer to free Syanna - for Dettlaff's sake.
Regis|For the sake of you both.
Geralt|Oh, please. Orphanage, what happened there - his fault, plain and simple. City gutters are overflowing with blood - that's his doing, too. And you're worried somebody might've hurt his feelings?
Regis|To meet the Unseen Elder is to face mortal danger - I've said so all along and never in jest. You are a friend, a dear friend. I'd rather you not risk your neck unnecessarily - I think it's natural, I think it's obvious. Obviously natural. Especially when we've an alternative. An entirely reasonable one.
Geralt|Not well.
Regis|Oh? Did she not divulge where you might find the Unseen?
Geralt|No, she did. Also divulged her hunger for the blood of small children.
Regis|I admit I'd heard rumors, but… preferred to lend them no credence.
Geralt|Rather not talk about it. Cave's west of town, other side of the lake. That's where we need to go.
Regis|I see. I'm prepared to set out at any time, but…
Regis|Perhaps we could give it one more try? I mean, we were so close…
Geralt|Mhm. But I changed my mind.
Regis|Yet perhaps you'd care to reconsider once more?
Geralt|Don't push it, Regis. Orphanage - Dettlaff's fault. City gutters are overflowing with blood. Also his doing. And you're worried somebody might've hurt his feelings? Come on.
Regis|In meeting the Unseen Elder you will risk all. You cannot be certain to leave with your life. Yet if we meet Dettlaff's demand, the killing will cease at once.
Regis|You've met with Orianna. How did it go?
Regis|So, you decided to talk to Orianna after all… How did you fare?
Geralt|Ahem… Uh, so, I'll be at the boat landing near the palace… waiting for Regis there… Mind telling him?
Regis|Greetings, Geralt.
<|endoftext|>
Regis|We must be close.
Geralt|How can you tell?
Regis|Listen.
Geralt|Don't hear a thing. Hm. Not one rat, one bat… dead quiet.
Regis|As I said, he despises guests.
Original Vampire|Nac… Thi… Sel me thaur?
Regis|Spureni veres nac atranes. Avile cleva Regis, etu--
Original Vampire|Zatlath!
Geralt|Not one step further.
Original Vampire|Yes. You have walked your last.
Geralt|Argh! No…! Ugh. Wait…!
Original Vampire|Ssshhh.
Geralt|Rather not hurt you.
Original Vampire|Hehehehehehe…
Geralt|No…! Wait…!
Original Vampire|Ssshhh.
<|endoftext|>
Original Vampire|You live…
Geralt|Barely.
Geralt|You're not attacking. That mean you'll hear me out?
Original Vampire|Perhaps.
Original Vampire|Speak.
Geralt|Here about Dettlaff. He's--
Original Vampire|I know who he is.
Original Vampire|What of him?
Geralt|He's sicced a swarm of lesser vampires on the city. I have to stop him.
Original Vampire|But I do not.
Geralt|Help me, and I'll return the favor.
Original Vampire|Hehehehehe…
Original Vampire|You? Help me? How?
Geralt|Depends on you. I'm not just some human, I'm--
Original Vampire|You are no one.
Original Vampire|I ask for the last time. Why should I care about Dettlaff? Why should I help you?
Original Vampire|You waste my time.
Geralt|No. No, wait…
Geralt|Innocents are dying.
Original Vampire|Humans, elves, dwarves… die each day. By the hundreds.
Original Vampire|As do cattle. Swine. Rats.
Geralt|You see no difference? Refuse to believe it.
Original Vampire|Swine do not disturb me.
Geralt|Sooner or later, Dettlaff'll bring trouble, serious trouble.
Original Vampire|How?
Geralt|As Khagmar brought trouble before.
Geralt|Folk'll take him down, eventually. Might need a year, or two, or a decade. But they'll find a way.
Geralt|And then they'll go after other vampires. And eventually, they'll find you.
Original Vampire|And I should fear…?
Geralt|Death? No. But that'll be the end of your peace, your quiet. Knights errant, mages - they'll come here day in, day out. One already managed to teleport here. Others will follow - you can be sure.
Geralt|You'll kill them, of course. So they'll flood these caves… or bring in sappers from Mahakam and collapse them.
Original Vampire|No… This place must be secure. The gate…
Regis|Uuuugh… Echhh…
Original Vampire|What is your plan?
Geralt|Dettlaff must die.
Original Vampire|I will not kill one of my own.
Regis|We ask only that you summon him. We… we shall see to the rest.
Original Vampire|If you drink from him...
Regis|I will be anathema. This I know. And still I ask you to summon Dettlaff.
Original Vampire|Where?
Regis|Tesham Mutna.
Original Vampire|Go. Once I sense you there, I will summon Dettlaff.
Regis|I thank you.
Original Vampire|Leave me.
Regis|Oooph… That went better than I expected it would.
Geralt|Time to summon Dettlaff.
Regis|Ah. Yes… high time. Do… do you wish to go to Tesham Mutna right away?
Geralt|Let's go. Want to get this over with.
Geralt|Think that went better than…? You kidding? I'd 'ave been dead on the spot if not for my slowed metabolism.
Regis|And yet you survived.
Regis|Though you are risking your life. The question is why. This contract… it goes well beyond what witchers customarily handle. I cannot abandon the matter, for Dettlaff and I are bound by blood, but you… you could simply walk away.
Regis|So why, my friend? Why stay and risk your hide?
Geralt|Been on the Path so long I… I don't really know anymore. Guess I'm looking for the road's end.
Regis|Perhaps you should simply step off it?
Geralt|I'll think about it. Once this is over.
Geralt|Same reason as ever. For the reward.
Regis|You believe it will be worth all this?
Geralt|Better be.
Geralt|For you. You're in a heap of trouble, Regis, trouble Dettlaff brought on. Seen you die once already. That one time was enough.
Regis|I… Hm. I'm not certain I know what to say.
Regis|I am grateful, Geralt.
Geralt|All your Unseen that… hm… welcoming?
Regis|No. They vary. Some are conceited, others imperious, but… most can be reasoned with.
Regis|But him… It was clear each word was a great effort. Interacting with others, it seems it causes him physical pain.
Geralt|Never entered my mind - that the Conjunction of the Spheres was also a cataclysm for you, for…
Regis|Monsters. No euphemism required, you needn't seek one.
Regis|I dare say it was worse for us. You arrived by the thousands, we were but a handful. Not much choice - assimilate with you… or shut ourselves off from the world. Like him.
Geralt|And you? How do you feel now, where you are?
Regis|Geralt, imagine the least comfortable situation you could ever find yourself in. What would it be? I don't mean a moment of pain, with death knocking at your door, just a circumstance of great unease.
Geralt|All right, in that case a court banquet. Gotta show up in hose and a tight doublet. Gotta smile at everyone and engage in vacuous conversation. While Dandelion sings a ballad about me and Yennefer for all to hear.
Regis|Very well. Now imagine you're stuck there - not for an hour, not for an evening, but for all time.
Regis|And should you fall out of character for but a moment, should you so much as scratch yourself where the stitching chafes, all around you will scream, "Monster! Monster!" And they'll turn on you and tear you to shreds.
Geralt|Sounds… tiring. Damn tiring.
Regis|I couldn't have put it better myself.
Geralt|Cave I was tossed into… that where the gate between worlds is?
Regis|In a sense, yes. Just slammed shut, sealed tight.
Geralt|Think it'll ever open again? Think you'll be able to go home?
Regis|Ah. I sincerely doubt it. And I think in truth the Elder knows that as well.
Geralt|So why would he stay down there? What's the real reason?
Regis|Hm. To stay with the "gate" analogy - no door is ever completely impermeable. Smells come through, for instance. And when the wind rises, some dust might be blown through the cracks. A palpable trace of things on the other side.
Regis|It's not much… but it is something.
Geralt|Dettlaff - we have to convince him to spare the city.
Original Vampire|Will he?
Regis|Probably not. Yet… we must try nonetheless.
Original Vampire|If there is a fight, if you help kill him...
Regis|I will be anathema. This I know. And still I ask you to summon Dettlaff.
Geralt|You'll kill them, naturally. So they'll flood these caves… or collapse 'em with explosives. Destroying the gate you guard beyond repair.
Geralt|Cave I came out of… what was that place?
Original Vampire|There lies the gate between this world… and ours. It is closed.
Original Vampire|But it shall open once more. In one hundred of your years. Two hundred. Three.
Original Vampire|Soon.
Original Vampire|Now speak. Don't ask. Or I will kill you.
Original Vampire|Questions. More questions!
Geralt|What… what's with Regis?
Original Vampire|Nothing. He sleeps.
Geralt|Will you wake him?
Original Vampire|Perhaps. Perhaps not.
Original Vampire|You were to speak. Not question. Speak! Or die!
Geralt|Need a moment to cool down after that… that meeting. Meet you there.
Geralt|Eclthi, lautni ama.
Geralt|Hey… Anyone here…? Just wanna talk!
<|endoftext|>
Regis|It worked. And a good thing, too, I'd be hard pressed to seep through this gate as a puff of fog.
Geralt|What's inside? Know what to expect?
Regis|Hmm… vampires?
Geralt|Funny.
Geralt|Know much about this Unseen Elder?
Regis|Only that he takes unkindly to guests. Especially the unannounced.
Geralt|Oh, joy… Got a plan, some idea how to appease him?
Regis|Hm. The custom when meeting an Unseen Elder is to bestow upon him a stone symbolizing peace. Yet this type of stone occurs only in Haakland.
Geralt|Take it you're fresh out.
Regis|Alas, just so. Thus I fear we must rely on my personal charm.
Regis|I'll fly ahead. Reconnoiter a bit.
Regis|I see you've strayed from the course… Very well, go wild. I shall await you on the other side.
Geralt|Whoa. Got company.
Regis|Then we must give them a proper welcome.
Geralt|Where'd the Unseen's hatred of social calls come from? Folk forget to wipe their boots? He get sick of sweeping up all the time?
Regis|Hm. It's somewhat more complex.
Geralt|Tell me slowly, don't use complicated words, and I might just understand.
Regis|I don't doubt your intelligence, but… well, it's just hard to explain to a human.
Regis|This world is a foreign land to us. Unpleasant. Hostile, even.
Regis|The Elder does what he can to isolate, protect himself. And we, as all guests, hinder him in this endeavor.
Regis|Geralt! Over here.
Regis|Ahem. Might I suggest you use Orianna's key?
Regis|Let's find the Unseen One first. Then we'll talk.
Regis|Geralt, I adore our conversations, I do. But this is simply not the right time.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Dammit… that was close.
Geralt|What the hell…? What is this place?!
Geralt|Well, well. Someone was here before me.
Geralt|Incredible… Explains a lot.
Geralt|I'm… upside down? Gravity's flipped. Getting pulled up instead of down…
Geralt|Mage's letter mentioned the thin border between worlds here… Explains the disruptions in gravity.
Geralt|Somewhere towards the middle, things're reversed. You fall up, instead of down. Hm, could use that…
Geralt|Is that stream… flowing upwards? Strange. Clearly worth a look…
Geralt|Tip of the rock extends to the side where gravity's reversed…
Geralt|Tip'll fly upwards if it breaks off. Just gotta collapse the base.
Geralt|Hm. That should do the trick.
Geralt|Worked. Now just need the Elder to discover his talkative side…
Geralt|Uggh… Busted ribs… internal hemorrhage… Need to drink a healing potion. Fast.
Geralt|Uggh… Busted ribs… internal hemorrhage… Need to drink a healing potion. Fast.
Geralt|A camp? Here?
Geralt|Research didn't end well.
Geralt|Wonder what happened to him.
Geralt|Megascope… damaged.
Geralt|Hm… Maybe this'll tell me something…
Geralt|An offering for the Unseen… Damn, could use something like that.
Geralt|Maybe if I give this to the Unseen Elder, he won't kill me… least not right away.
Geralt|Doubt the Elder'll be glad to see me…
Geralt|Elder'll kill me even if I get out of here… unless I think of something quick.
Geralt|Dammit… What kind of vampire was that? Never seen the likes…
Geralt|Waterfall's… flowing from the lake on the cave's roof?
Geralt|A waterfall… flowing upwards. What's going on here…?
Geralt|Must be the offering for the Unseen…
Geralt|No way he could've survived. Didn't stand a chance.
Geralt|Footprints. Deep set. A man's.
Geralt|Back the other way, I think. Waterfall I climbed down to get here won't work. Could be another, though. Need to follow the current downstream.
Geralt|Water's flowing over to the other side. Carry me there, too?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Nice place.
Regis|Isn't it? Offers a lovely view of the valley. On a clear day you can see the outlines of Dun Tynne.
Geralt|Shame, the reason why we came here.
Regis|Yes. Quite the shame.
Geralt|Regis, let the Unseen Elder know we've arrived. Have him summon Dettlaff.
Regis|Hinthial cesu, themias.
Dettlaff|You didn't manage to find me, so you forced a meeting.
Dettlaff|Why?
Geralt|You know why.
Dettlaff|I've tired of guessing your human thoughts. So articulate them or leave me be.
Geralt|Came here to kill you.
Dettlaff|Brief and to the point… how refreshing.
Dettlaff|Well then try, witcher.
Geralt|I understand your anger, but you need to stop the attacks in the city. Immediately.
Dettlaff|My conditions are clear. I wish to see Rhenawe--
Dettlaff|I wish to see Syanna. Yet she is not here.
Regis|You know why… The duchess would not release her.
Dettlaff|So the duchess must face the consequences.
Regis|Dettlaff… please. All this for one woman…?
Dettlaff|You understand nothing.
Dettlaff|Let us be done with this.
Geralt|You angry with me? For not freeing Syanna? For not trying to resolve this peacefully?
Regis|Hm. A bit.
Regis|Though… perhaps I was fooling myself, latching on to the notion because I badly wished to believe there was some way to fix everything.
Regis|However, matters have simply gone too far. I must come to terms with that.
Syanna|Is it, though? A ruin like any other, I think.
Regis|Ehh, so sensitive, so aware… Honestly, what did Dettlaff ever see in you?
Syanna|Perhaps he'll tell you himself.
Geralt|Let's get ready. Dettlaff'll be here any moment now.
Dettlaff|Rhen…
Dettlaff|Syanna. Syanna… I've a question I must ask you.
Dettlaff|Did you truly feign it all? That which bound us was a… ruse?
Syanna|Dettlaff… It's not that simple. I--
Dettlaff|Oh no. It's very simple. You either deceived me… or not.
Dettlaff|In forgiving you, I grieve, for now we must part.
Dettlaff|Mhh.A shame.
Geralt|Syanna!
Regis|What did you do…?
Dettlaff|What I had to do. What she deserved.
Dettlaff|Beauclair will know peace once more. The vampires will have left the city by dawn.
Dettlaff|I shall leave as well. Go far away. Far from men.
Dettlaff|You can try to stand in my way. Then I shall kill you both, though that is not at all my will. The decision is yours.
Geralt|Prepare to defend yourself.
Dettlaff|No chance. I prefer to attack.
Geralt|You can go. But if ever we meet again…
Dettlaff|I shall keep my distance. Believe me.
Dettlaff|Geralt, Regis… Farewell.
Regis|I'm sorry… I swore to protect her, I know… but it happened so fast.
Regis|What have we done…?
Geralt|Let a killer walk. Isn't that what you wanted from the start, though?
Geralt|We have to let Anna Henrietta know.
Regis|Geralt, you will face--
Geralt|I know. All the same, we have to inform her.
Geralt|The ribbon…
Dettlaff|Hah. Seems I've been fooled again.
Dettlaff|She will pay for this. Sooner or later, she will pay.
Dettlaff|You never should have meddled, witcher.
Geralt|You nervous?
Syanna|Mhm. It's always a bit nerve-wracking, meeting an ex. Especially so when said ex is a vampire.
Regis|I doubt he'll be in the mood for jests.
Syanna|I know. Ugh…
Syanna|May I be honest? Yes, I'm nervous. I really would prefer just to run off. I gave my word I would help, I know, but how much is that worth…?
Syanna|Yet I owe him this meeting. And that is that.
Syanna|What…? But how?
<|endoftext|>
Dettlaff Vampire|You should have brought her, witcher. I am disappointed.
Geralt|You murdered innocents. Don't owe you a damn thing.
Dettlaff Vampire|I wanted just the lass. You tricked me, both of you.
Geralt|Didn't plan any of it.
Dettlaff Vampire|Silence!
Geralt|You bastard!
Dettlaff Vampire|You should not have meddled!
Dettlaff Monster|Auuuggghh! If you acknowledge any gods… start praying, now.
Dettlaff Monster|Aaauuuggghhrr! Do you think that will stop me? Prepare to die, witcher!
Geralt|That won't be necessary.
Geralt|Cut the nonsense and fight!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Need to withdraw, you and your men. Now.
Damien|My duty lies with the city.
Geralt|Won't help the city by leading your men to the slaughter. Damien… conversation back at the palace, remember? I'll say it again - your men don't stand a chance.
Damien|Men! Tend to the wounded and prepare to march out!
Geralt|Doing the right thing… Now listen close. Silver - that's what you want to use against vampires. Your alchemists, order them to produce as much vampire oil as they can, churn it out in gallons. Then coat your blades with it.
Geralt|Keep an eye out for alps and bruxae. The shapely ones, resemble women. There one moment, gone the next. Bombs containing silver splinters are a pretty good idea.
Damien|Thank you, witcher. I hope you're worth the coin the duchess pledged you. And that you'll return with the head of the wretch that did this skewered on a hook.
Geralt|Got a different plan.
Damien|Hm. And what would that be?
Geralt|All I can say just now is I'm gonna need Syanna.
Damien|You know the duchess' decision. Syanna awaits her trial. In custody.
Geralt|Yeah, I know it. Doesn't mean I have to agree with it.
Damien|You've that luxury. I do not. I've sworn my loyalty to Her Grace.
Geralt|Folk're dying. Many more will. Because of one.
Damien|If Her Grace learns I helped you, my head will roll.
Geralt|And mine'll come right after. Still willing to take the risk.
Geralt|See I'm wasting time here.
Damien|Wait.
Damien|When… when last I saw Syanna, Her Grace was escorting her to the palace playroom.
Geralt|Playroom? As in, for children? You sure?
Damien|I've served in the Ducal Palace for years. I know its every corner. So yes, I am damn sure.
Geralt|Playroom… So what, duchess lock Syanna up in a dollhouse?
Damien|Honestly? I've no clue. Look, I've told you what I saw. What you do with it is no concern of mine.
Geralt|Got it… I'll look into it. You get back to your barracks. Retrace my steps, path oughta be clear.
Regis|And… you've our gratitude. You helped us a great deal.
Damien|I helped Beauclair. At least, I hope I did.
Geralt|Let's go, Regis.
Geralt|Meet you by the playroom, Regis.
Regis|So be it. But try not to tarry.
Damien|If Her Grace learns I helped you, my head will roll.
Regis|And ours will follow right after it. Yet still we are prepared to take the risk.
Regis|I fear we waste our time here. Come, Geralt.
Damien|Wait.
Geralt|Can't force you. Won't try.
Geralt|But I'd urge you to ask yourself a question… How'll you feel tomorrow when you bury more soldiers while knowing you might've prevented their deaths - but chose not to even try?
Regis|We know it. But we do not agree with it.
Damien|You've that luxury. I do not. I've sworn my loyalty to Her Grace.
Geralt|Your problem's my problem now. Leave it to me, I'll solve it.
Damien|How?
Damien|Blast. Blast it all…
Damien|You killed it… Single-handedly? That harlotsbrood slaughtered half my unit!
Geralt|See it came damn close to slaughtering you as well.
Regis|I see the harlotsbrood came close to slaughtering you as well.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Regis, rather not have a fistfight with this door. Would you mind…?
Regis|Not at all.
Geralt|What the-? Found a notebook. "Property of Isabelle de Roquefort, Court Governess." The notes of Syanna and Anna Henrietta's governess. When they were little.
Regis|I'm not sure it will help, but I suppose there's no harm in leafing through them.
Geralt|"Syanna gave me a drawing today…"
Regis|Charming.
Geralt|"…of freshly decapitated bodies covered in blood."
Regis|Perhaps not so much…
Geralt|"I asked her why ever she would draw such a thing. Her Highness claimed it was a rendering of nightmares which have plagued her for as long as she can remember. Syanna does wake up screaming nearly every night, save when she shares a bed with Anarietta."
Geralt|Curse of the Black Sun. Supposedly girls afflicted by it had horrible dreams. Kind of horrible that made some of 'em go mad.
Geralt|"The girls quarreled today. I must note rather sadly they did not behave as befits future ladies. The incident devolved into fisticuffs."
Geralt|"Anna Henrietta was first to strike her sister. Syanna gave back as good as she'd gotten."
Geralt|"By the time I separated them, Anarietta had lost two teeth. She ran off to complain to her parents…"
Geralt|"His Grace the Duke refused to believe my version of events. He laid all the blame on Syanna and vowed to punish the little one harshly… Anarietta did her best to have her sister's sentence commuted, but the Duke and Duchess proved unbending."
Regis|Tsk, tsk. Once you're labeled a black sheep, it's so hard to shed that reputation.
Geralt|"Today I accompanied the girls for the first time to the Land of a Thousand Fables. We spent half the day there."
Geralt|"First we played with Thumbelina, then with Barbarossa, who proved quite the charmer for a brigand and pirate."
Regis|I'm beginning to suspect Isabelle de Roquefort wrote in her diary after taking a powerful hallucinogenic. Cannabis rudelaris, for instance, or…
Geralt|Shh! Don't interrupt.
Geralt|"I tip my cap to Master Artorius Vigo for his achievement. He has proved he has no equal in the arcane arts."
Regis|Wait. Artorius was the court mage here, a specialist in illusions. Which means…
Geralt|Regis, last warning - stop interrupting, or I'll seat you in the corner.
Geralt|"The girls told me if I ever wished to visit alone, I need but crack open 'The Land of a Thousand Fables' and utter out loud the incantation 'Expecto ludum!'"
Regis|A book as the key to an illusion. My, my, this grows more interesting by the minute.
Geralt|"Mages sent by the Conclave arrived today. They came to examine Syanna."
Geralt|"I cannot know what conclusions they drew, but His Grace now seems clearly upset."
Regis|Hm, Curse of the Black Sun - it was no doubt then that she was diagnosed with the syndrome's symptoms.
Geralt|Or had that label planted on her. It goes on - "I dared ask the duke what would become of the girl."
Geralt|"He did not reply."
Geralt|"I tutored the girls in Nilfgaardian today…"
Geralt|"Syanna applies herself so, though she has great difficulty memorizing new vocabulary. Lady Anarietta seems more gifted in this regard, yet also prone to impish behavior."
Geralt|"When she thought me out of earshot, she called me a 'bloede kusse.' She and Syanna laughed so hard they almost choked."
Geralt|Hmm. "Bloede" is "damned" or "cursed." What's "kusse"?
Regis|In the melodious tongue of our none too friendly neighbors to the south, the word describes the many-petaled flower that blooms in that place we so unmelodiously call the crotch.
Geralt|Hm. Realize this might sound improbable, but maybe, just maybe…. Anna Henrietta tossed Syanna into that illusion?
Regis|Not impossible. She would be safe there… and isolated. We must see.
Geralt|Locked… Of course.
Geralt|Thanks.
Regis|At your service.
Geralt|Shit… Probably meant to stand guard… at Anna Henrietta's personal request.
Regis|Mirror, mirror on the wall… I despise these things.
Regis|A rocking horse. Rather worn. I suppose it got a lot of use…
Geralt|Nothing under the carpet.
Regis|Did you expect something? Apart from the dust swept under there by a lazy chambermaid?
Geralt|Something inside? Nope - empty.
Geralt|Where's that book…?
Regis|Here. The playroom's beyond this door.
Geralt|Wooden duck. Somebody broke its wings off.
Geralt|A tin knight.
Geralt|Miniature tableware… and plush toys. Cute.
Geralt|Swear I saw that book somewhere…
Regis|Beyond the door's the playroom. Found one of my brethren sniffing about. I made sure he'd stay out of our way.
Regis|Careful!
Geralt|Well, well… a key tucked behind a picture.
Regis|Kind of you to summon me. I thank you wholeheartedly.
Geralt|Locked. Hmm.
Geralt|Hm. Utter silence. No one here.
Regis|We should look around at least.
Geralt|Nice tune.
Regis|Indeed, pleasant. It's a shame the mechanism's damaged.
<|endoftext|>
Fairy Tale Witch|Hands off of my hearth, dearie. You wouldn't want me to get cross.
Syanna|Then you open it!
Fairy Tale Witch|Now who is this? A lost traveler? You're not supposed to be here, sweetie.
Fairy Tale Witch|Why, you're old. Old and pale. But never worry - a bit of butter, a bit of spice, and you'll make a tasty morsel.
Fairy Tale Witch|Just as soon as I catch you.
Syanna|Bloody hell! Let him out!
Fairy Tale Witch|He gobbled up my gingerbread. Now it's my turn to gobble him. Heeheehee!
Syanna|Ugh!
Syanna|Seems you're having a tough go of it, witcher.
Syanna|Felicitations, witcher. It seems you've won.
Geralt|Hm. Voices?
Syanna|Be careful!
Syanna|Come, now! You cannot possibly fear a few magical plants!
Syanna|Ugh… That soup smells more vile than a rotting carcass! Careful she doesn't douse you!
Syanna|Hah! A clash of sword and broomstick! I've not seen this before!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What… what the hell was that?
Syanna|The Wicked Witch. You've heard of her, haven't you? Now where did she put that key…?
Geralt|Listen, I… How'd you come by a weapon?
Syanna|It's Prince Charming's. He no longer needs it.
Syanna|Here it is!
Toussaint Boy 02|Akh akh akh… Thank you. She'd have baked me for certain if you'd not… Syanna? Is that you?!
Syanna|It's been years, Jack.
Toussaint Boy 02|H-have you come to play?
Syanna|No, I just want your beans. So you can breathe easy.
Geralt|Breathe easy… because you aren't here to play? What's that about?
Syanna|Jack knows what I mean. So he'll tell me where the beans are as fast as he can, isn't that right?
Toussaint Boy 02|Syanna, I… I'm sorry, but… but I haven't got them!
Syanna|Oh, something tells me you're lying. Perhaps you wish to play the old games after all, hm? "This little piggy went to market, this little piggy went home," for instance?
Toussaint Boy 02|I'm telling the truth! I swear it! Anarietta… She ordered them buried all over so you wouldn't be able to leave!
Syanna|Where?
Toussaint Boy 02|I… I don't know! But… Joss, the boy with the thing for wolves, he should know! He sticks his nose in everyone's affairs!
Syanna|He had better know! Because if not, I'll find you and we'll have ourselves a little talk, understand? Now shoo!
Syanna|Agh, all right… So why is it you're here?
Geralt|Came to free you.
Syanna|Nice of you, but a waste of your effort. I plan to free myself.
Geralt|You might, you might not. Bound to be easier with my help - as our most recent adventure amply showed.
Syanna|Mhm. Yet I still don't know why you even give a damn.
Geralt|It's Dettlaff. He's trying to force Anna Henrietta's hand. Wants her to release you. Summoned monsters to attack Beauclair.
Syanna|Sounds like Dettlaff, all right… But I doubt you came all this way just to bring me up to speed on current events. So get to the point, please.
Geralt|Isn't it obvious? Offering to be your ally. We both want you out of here. You, because you want your freedom back. Me, because as soon as you meet with Dettlaff, he'll put an end to the chaos in the city.
Syanna|You exposed me. I landed in prison because of you. Now you come to beg my help, I daresay? My, life is full of surprises, isn't it?
Syanna|Normally, I'd tell you to sod off. But… from what you say, folk are dying who have nothing to do with this. Not part of the plan. Dettlaff was only to kill those who deserved it. No one else.
Syanna|Fine, witcher… I accept your offer. Consider us allies. Shake on it.
Geralt|So… what's with the beans? Mind explaining?
Syanna|Hm. Certainly. But you must gird yourself with patience.
Syanna|There are two ways out of this land. My darling sister blocked one when she tossed me in here. The other's up there… in the clouds. She made it hard but not impossible to access by concealing the beans.
Geralt|Still don't understand…
Syanna|Don't fret, just listen. That boy… that was Jack. Of beanstalk fame. You know the tale?
Geralt|Jack… climbed a gigantic beanstalk to a giant's castle, high up in the clouds…
Syanna|As we shall do if we can just find those blasted beans… There are three - one red, one blue, one yellow.
Geralt|Huh… Stalk won't sprout from just one?
Syanna|No, because it must transpire exactly as it did in the tale. Clear now? So, we must find Joss. Perhaps he will be able to help us. You lead.
Geralt|This place… Tell me something more. It's an illusion, right?
Syanna|Yes. Created by Artorius Vigo. Anna Henrietta and I would come here to play out scenes from our favorite fables.
Geralt|Witch didn't seem like she was playing.
Syanna|Magical entropy. Without maintenance, the spell gradually disintegrates over time. It grows wild.
Geralt|Your sister chose a dangerous place for your prison…
Syanna|It's deceptive. Provided I don't provoke them, the fairytale characters don't attack me. But you… you don't belong here. So you had best be on your watch.
Geralt|Since you brought it up… The knights Dettlaff killed - what exactly did they do to you? Crespi, du Lac, la Croix, Peyrac-Peyran?
Syanna|Not a memory I enjoy revisiting, but… I suppose you deserve to know.
Syanna|When my parents disowned me, they ordered those very knights to escort me beyond the duchy's borders. All did so without uttering a single word in my defense.
Geralt|Like you said, they had their orders…
Syanna|Mhm. But Crespi was not ordered to beat me unconscious with a horsewhip after my first attempt at escape. And du Lac had no instructions to deny me food and abuse me.
Syanna|I learned something then - knights are not so chivalrous when no one's watching.
Geralt|That… explains a lot.
Syanna|Shocked, aren't you. You must have thought you had me pegged. Before bothering to hear my side. Everyone does that.
Geralt|Sorry, but… that's no excuse.
Syanna|I didn't tell you so you would pardon me. I was only hoping you would understand.
Geralt|Curse of the Black Sun - that's why you were banished, right?
Syanna|Mhm. Twisted princesses, mutants. I'm certain you've heard of us.
Geralt|Even met one of you. Renfri of Creyden.
Syanna|And? Was she truly monstrous?
Geralt|She was cruel, that's certain. But what caused it - the curse or what she went through… Asking myself to this day.
Syanna|You killed her, didn't you.
Geralt|Had no choice.
Syanna|Funny. Mum said the same when she tossed me out of the house.
Geralt|Searching for my lost childhood. Wound up at Kaer Morhen as a little boy, don't quite remember how. Never had any toys, never played any games…
Geralt|What do you think? Why might I be here?
Geralt|Beans? What beans?
Syanna|Ahem. Try not to interrupt. Well, Jack, where are they?
Syanna|Joss can usually be found wandering the glade at the foot of the mount. It's some distance from here, past the witch's house, to the right.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Relax. It's over.
Boy Who Cried Wolf|No it's not! There's more! Another wolf! Behind you!
Syanna|Ignore him. He always lies.
Geralt|Ah ha. Boy who cried wolf. Still does, I suppose. And doesn't…. when they actually appear.
Syanna|The one and only. Listen, you little chit, Jack said you know what's become of his three beans.
Boy Who Cried Wolf|I don't know anything! Not one thing! And besides, watch out! Wolves!
Geralt|All right. We should go.
Boy Who Cried Wolf|Watch out for wolves!!
Geralt|Tough to talk to, that one.
Syanna|Was it, though? You need merely remember he always lies… Or, more precisely, reverses the truth.
Geralt|Mhm. Where to now?
Syanna|I'm not sure… We should visit some of the other fables, the meaty ones, that is. Perhaps then Joss' hints will make more sense.
Syanna|It's just a few - Red Riding Hood, piglets and bears - three of each, and Goldilocks, of course. Then Longlocks and a little lass who sells flint.
Geralt|Ah. Fine. Let's get to work.
Geralt|Let's say for a minute you know what happened to the red bean… where wouldn't it be?
Boy Who Cried Wolf|For certain no one swallowed it. Oh no, definitely not that!
Syanna|Of course not. But say someone didn't, who would it be that didn't… swallow it?
Boy Who Cried Wolf|A human! The most humany human in the Land of a Thousand Fables!
Boy Who Cried Wolf|Everyone! Woooolves!!! Run!
Boy Who Cried Wolf|Good folk!!! Woooolv--
Syanna|Say that word one more time, and I'll chop you up! Feed you to the fishes! Understood?
Geralt|Bet you haven't heard what happened to the blue bean. Maybe? Not at all? Right?
Boy Who Cried Wolf|I've heard it lies about somewhere, out in the open.
Geralt|Just like that? No one guarding it?
Boy Who Cried Wolf|Nobody! Three times over!
Boy Who Cried Wolf|Help! Wooooolves!!!
Geralt|Yellow bean - don't know a thing about it, right…?
Boy Who Cried Wolf|Hmm…. It's somewhere very, and I mean very, deep. So deep, in fact, it's completely underground!
Syanna|And who has it? Hm?
Boy Who Cried Wolf|A bald farmhand, who in no way and not at all, awaits someone. Not in the slightest!
Geralt|Thanks for your help. So long.
Boy Who Cried Wolf|No wolves here! None at all!
Boy Who Cried Wolf|This is grand! I'm all right! Not in any danger!
Syanna|That's him! Joss! Blast, they're going to rip him in six!
Geralt|All right. Let's try again.
Boy Who Cried Wolf|Wooolves! Leg it! Run for your lives!
Geralt|This'll be interesting. Right, let's get to it.
Boy Who Cried Wolf|Woooooolves!
Boy Who Cried Wolf|Wolves on the prowl, coming down the mountain!
<|endoftext|>
Syanna|That would never fit you. Give it to me.
Syanna|How do I look?
Geralt|Not bad. Not bad at all.
Syanna|Let's go see the Big Bad Wolf.
Geralt|Lemme guess… you'll play the granddaughter.
Syanna|Mhm. And you - the hunter.
Geralt|Sorry, don't know much about fashion.
Syanna|Yes, it shows.
Geralt|Honestly? So-so.
Syanna|Women must love you.
Geralt|Actually, I do just fine.
Syanna|What?
Big Bad Wolf|A thousand times they cut my gut open, filled it full of rocks and drowned me in the river! So once you stopped coming, I decided to repay the little imp for all her loving labor.
Big Bad Wolf|Hood now rots at the bottom of the well. She and the Hunter. Which means we can't play, and I'm under no obligation to talk to you. Not about beans nor anything else. So leave me be! Sod off!
Geralt|So… what now?
Syanna|Don't worry. I'll play with him, or rather play him… I just need that little red hood. The piece of apparel, that is. Not the poor girl's corpse.
Geralt|That's a relief.
Syanna|You wished to help me? Here's your chance. Jump in the well and fish it out. Well? Chop, chop!
Geralt|Hm. Wolf's pretty cranky…
Syanna|Surprised? Think about it. He was cast in the role of the nemesis without ever asking for it.
Syanna|It's a dog's life, I tell you…
Geralt|Hello? Can we ta--?
Big Bad Wolf|Shhhush. Bumbotch, my head… Damn it all, I swear, that was the last time I drank with Redbeard…
Big Bad Wolf|Oh, Syanna. A bloody long time it's been. You've changed.
Syanna|Whereas you, not at all, Big Bad Wolf. Though it seems you've started running with the wrong crowd…
Big Bad Wolf|And who should I run with, eh? Thumbelina? One shot, and she's under the table. But, but, but… what brings you?
Geralt|Listen, looking for magic beans. Seen any?
Big Bad Wolf|Hmm… I was given one for safekeeping, but…
Syanna|Where is it? Talk!
Big Bad Wolf|Shhhh, not so loud!
Syanna|I can be much louder than this. And resort to other means of persuasion.
Big Bad Wolf|Ah, right there, the threats! Syanna to a T! Listen, I exist to restage a fairytale. If you want to play at it, I'll be happy to oblige… but it won't be easy. The thing is, Little Red Riding Hood's popped her clogs.
Geralt|Not a problem. Syanna can take her place.
Big Bad Wolf|What? Hmph. Very well, it's not as if I can forbid you… Ahem. Granddaughter, come closer, sweetie!
Syanna|But grandmamma, what big eyes you have!
Big Bad Wolf|The better to see you with, my dear.
Syanna|Granny, what big arms you have!
Big Bad Wolf|The better to embrace you with, my dear.
Syanna|And grandmamma, what big teeth you have! Eh?
Big Bad Wolf|The better to eat you with, my dear! GRRRAAAARR!
Geralt|We'll be back. C'mon, Syanna.
Geralt|You could always have a drink with us.
Big Bad Wolf|What? Now? Not on your life. I can barely stand I'm so hungover…
Syanna|You know what they say about the "hair of the dog."
Big Bad Wolf|Out of the question… And why must you drink? Do you wish to drown some sorrow? And I don't mean to pry, but… you don't look much like a young duchess to me.
Syanna|They stripped me of my title and birthright, then banished me. A family spat, let's say.
Big Bad Wolf|You again? I thought I was clear. I will not talk to you if Little Red Riding Hood is not with you!
Syanna|Remember what Joss said about the red bean. A human has it… and he definitely didn't swallow it.
Geralt|Mhm. Gotta open his belly.
Geralt|Bottle caps… fake teeth… a corkscrew… Ah, here it is. Red bean.
Syanna|Well then - one step closer to our goal.
Geralt|What?
Syanna|I find myself wondering if you're just horribly discreet, or if those mutations completely scrubbed away your curiosity.
Syanna|In your shoes, I'd have myriad questions. For instance, "Syanna, whatever became of you after they drove you out?" But you? Nothing. You avoid all talk of it.
Geralt|Well, since you brought it up… I'd gladly hear about it.
Syanna|The flower of Toussaint's knights took me all the way to the Caed Dhu wilderness and left me there alone, without a copper, in a torn lace dress. Right when the frosts were setting in.
Syanna|They assumed something would eat me. Or that I'd do everyone a favor and die of hunger.
Syanna|But as always, I failed to live up to expectations. I wandered the woods for a week, went purple from the cold, gnawed the bark from twigs. Finally I saw a light among the trees… a campsite.
Syanna|They were bandits. Bearded, drunk, spattered with blood. I was sure they'd rape me or kill me… or both.
Geralt|Take it neither happened?
Syanna|That's when I learned a robber and murderer can be a better man than a knight in shining armor.
Syanna|They took me in, we set off for Nazair… and I did what I could to repay them. I advanced in their ranks rather quickly. Eventually I became their leader. Of the whole ragged band.
Geralt|Been through a lot.
Syanna|I have. And throughout this time my sister was stomping grapes and shagging minstrels on down bedding.
Geralt|She wasn't the one to banish you.
Syanna|And I'm not angry at her for that. I'm angry at her because she forgot. About me.
Syanna|Right, we've had our chat. Come.
Geralt|Should've stayed there, maybe.
Syanna|Perhaps. Perhaps I should have forgotten everything, started a new life.
Syanna|But you know what? There came a point when I thought, "You wanted a monster? Then a monster you shall get."
Geralt|Well, since you brought it up… I'd gladly hear the rest. Let's see, they'd escorted you out of the duchy…
Syanna|Yes, and the noble knights of Toussaint and I didn't stop until we reached the Caed Dhu wilderness. They left me there alone, without a copper, in a torn lace dress. Right when the frosts were setting in.
Geralt|Ah, you're just less interesting than you think.
Geralt|Don't know the details of your story, no, but they don't matter. I've met a lot like you.
Syanna|Like me?
Geralt|You were wronged, betrayed. So you think you have a moral right to exact bloody vengeance. And you've set out to settle the score… even if it costs you your life.
Syanna|Well, well. You've seen right through me.
Geralt|Not entirely. Still don't know if you realize how badly you fucked up. Doing what you did to Dettlaff.
Syanna|On second thought, I liked you more when you were silent. Let's get out of here.
Syanna|Are you really not interested in what happened? In what became of me after they cast me out?
Syanna|Ah, at last we have them all.
Geralt|All right… time to jump in the well.
Syanna|Break a leg.
Syanna|Any trouble? That took a while.
Geralt|Trouble the only option? Ran into a rather helpful little blue flame. Wanted to show me something.
Syanna|Any luck?
Geralt|Yep. Look what I got.
Big Bad Wolf|I need peace and quiet. Leave me alone…
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Girl 02|Care for a cigarillo? A bit of tobacco? A dab of fisstech?
Geralt|Uhhh… remind me, what tale are you from?
Toussaint Girl 02|Sold flints when I was a lass. But no one bought them, so I branched out. Now I deal in snuffs, puffs, all sorts of fun things. What'll you have, sweeties?
Syanna|Magic beans. Do you have any?
Toussaint Girl 02|If it's not the new name of some kicker I already have, dearies - then no. But maybe you'd like some--
Syanna|Hey! Where'd you get that ribbon? That's mine!
Toussaint Girl 02|Is that so? Then why was it lying in the bushes? Finders keepers, sweetheart.
Geralt|Give Syanna the ribbon. Why not, huh?
Toussaint Girl 02|Sugarplum, the only thing I hand out for free is a first hit. To get them to come back for a second, of course. For all else, you've got to pay.
Geralt|What if asked you nicely?
Toussaint Girl 02|Ask me nicely and I might play you for it. A round of cards?
Geralt|All right. Let's play. If you lose, you give me the ribbon.
Toussaint Girl 02|Don't get your hopes up. None can best me at gwent.
Geralt|Fine, I'll pay you for the ribbon. This enough?
Toussaint Girl 02|It's enough. Now go away.
Syanna|All right. Tell me.
Geralt|What?
Syanna|What you want in return. You're not doing this out of the kindness of your heart.
Geralt|Don't want anything in return.
Syanna|I… Hm. Thank you.
Geralt|What have you got to sell, exactly?
Toussaint Girl 02|Like I said - tobacco, fisstech… All sorts of things. Have a look.
Geralt|Wasting time here, Syanna. Let's go.
Geralt|The ribbon - mind explaining what the fuss is about?
Syanna|There's not much to explain. I got it from Artorius Vigo when I was a child. It was to protect me from evil. It clearly didn't work, given how I ended up…
Geralt|But it means a lot to you.
Syanna|How should I put this… I have so few mementos from my childhood.
Syanna|And the ribbon reminds me of the good old days… when I was someone else.
Toussaint Girl 02|Dears… could you continue this touching scene elsewhere, hm? You're scaring away my customers.
Syanna|Nothing. We just want to get out of here. As fast as we can.
Toussaint Girl 02|Sweet cheeks, two puffs of my stuff, and I guarantee you'll fly out of here as if--
Toussaint Girl 02|What is it, loves? What is it you want?
Toussaint Girl 02|Rumpole, you're good at this. A word once given… the ribbon's yours. Now, skedaddle.
Toussaint Girl 02|You lost, friend. So if you still want that ribbon, you've got to pay up.
Toussaint Girl 02|Fliiiint! Ciiiigaaars! Piiiiipes! Rolling leaves!
Toussaint Girl 02|Tobacco of the highest caliber! Fisstech, pure as virgin tears!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|This Longlock's tower?
Syanna|Indeed. It's even taller than I remembered…
Geralt|Wait… what Joss said about the third bean, remember?
Syanna|In the possession of a bald farmhand, somewhere deep beneath the ground… Yes, this must be it. Let's go.
Geralt|Could pull myself up here… then I'll have to make that jump…
Syanna|If you say so… I shall wait down here, if it's all the same. Climbing's not my strong suit.
Geralt|Yellow bean, here it is. Would've stunk to climb all that way for nothing.
Syanna|We'd always grapple up her braid in the past, but… I don't see it anywhere.
Geralt|We'll find another way up.
Geralt|Hanged herself by her own hair…
Geralt|Prince's corpse… Tried to free Longlocks, but fell and broke his neck.
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|Too late! Too late!!!
<|endoftext|>
Syanna|Right, this is the spot. Pull out the beans.
Syanna|Now, we must plant them by the path near Longlocks' tower… Then prepare to meet the giant.
Syanna|Wait!
Geralt|Why?
Syanna|The stalk will sprout abruptly. Very abruptly. We must be careful.
Syanna|All right! Toss them!
Geralt|Agh… Something's always gotta go wr--
Syanna|The home stretch.
Geralt|Incredible…
Syanna|Admire the view later. First we must deal with…
Syanna|…him.
Syanna|This will be a good spot to plant the beans - once we have them all.
<|endoftext|>
Syanna|Here. We need but jump into the well. You first.
Geralt|Just gonna go our separate ways? No parting words?
Syanna|Did you wish to tell me something?
Geralt|Actually, that'd probably be best.
Syanna|Oh, my! No woman's ever treated you this way…
Geralt|Not that I recall, no.
Syanna|In that case, at last you've felt what so many women in this world feel at times.
Geralt|Ehh… I just hope this tale has a happy ending. For me, for you. For everyone.
Syanna|That may very well depend on you.
Geralt|What's that supposed to mean?
Syanna|Nothing beyond what you heard - for now.
Syanna|Come. The exit's this way.
Geralt|Think it might be time to get out of here.
Syanna|I couldn't agree more.
Geralt|For a fairytale creature, that was one tough son of a wench…
Syanna|I told you this land had gone ape mad… Though I did not expect it to be so severe.
Geralt|Can't help thinking you might've done that on purpose.
Syanna|Why ever would I have?
Geralt|To get rid of your guard, your captor. Getting close to the exit at this point. Probably think you don't need me anymore.
Syanna|Well, you're wrong. You still stand to be quite useful to me.
Geralt|That so? How? Plan to use me like you did Dettlaff?
Syanna|No, I need you for a purpose far simpler.
Syanna|Well, don't just stand there and stare. I need a man, Geralt, and I'm not afraid to say it. I've no idea what awaits me once we leave this place. Treat it as my last wish.
Geralt|…
Geralt|Another time, another place, maybe. No offense…
Syanna|None taken. You spoke clearly, you spoke honestly. It's fine.
Geralt|Yeah, I know. Gotta get you out of here. Come on.
Syanna|Wait. That's not what I meant. I need you for something far simpler, and far more pleasant…
Syanna|Well, don't just stand there and stare. I need a man, Geralt, and I'm not afraid to say it. I've no idea what awaits me once we leave this place. Treat it as my last wish.
Syanna|I don't like the look of that… Fall back!
Syanna|Watch out, Geralt!
Syanna|It's about to strike!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Portal's in a fountain? Not terribly practical…
Syanna|It was a secret passage. Anarietta and I would use it to…
Regis|… hide from your governess. Which luckily she noted down in her diary, thus I knew where to await you.
Regis|Never mind that… Has the young lady agreed to help clean up the mess she's made?
Syanna|She has. And stop treating me as if I were a child.
Regis|Would you prefer I treated you like the lying manipulator you are?
Geralt|Regis, what happened to your famous manners?
Regis|Apologies. I forgot myself. Ahem…
Geralt|Let's go. Really want to be done with this.
Geralt|Calm down, both of you.
Syanna|But--
Geralt|No buts.
Geralt|Syanna, you've already run afoul of one vampire… Don't start a fight with another, all right?
Syanna|Then tell said other vampire to stop taunting me.
Regis|I shall do my utmost.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Three bears…
Syanna|Three stools, three beds, three bowls…
Geralt|One a bit too big, the other too small, the third just right.
Geralt|Blonde curls… Rest of the body's too mutilated, hard to say anything.
Syanna|She got what she deserved, as I see it. Always took what she wanted without asking.
Geralt|No bean here… Gotta keep looking.
Geralt|Dammit… And this is a playground for two little girls? Something's not right.
Geralt|A bridge… red pepper underneath? Hm.
Syanna|Oh! Unicorns! We must catch them! We won't have to walk everywhere then.
Syanna|I call the pink one!
Syanna|Exciting, isn't it?! Reminds me of my childhood!
Geralt|Reminds me of something altogether different!
Syanna|Care to elaborate?!
Geralt|Rather not!
Syanna|Faster! Come on, you… you…! Know what?! They need names!
Syanna|I'll call mine… hm… Anise!
Geralt|Call mine Roach!
Syanna|Roach?! Are you serious?! Ugh…
Syanna|So… what exactly is happening in the city?
Geralt|Bloodshed, a massacre. Which is why we gotta hurry.
Syanna|You needn't fret. Time flows differently in the Fablesphere. We can stay here a week, yet outside mere minutes will have passed.
Syanna|So, do you like it here?
Geralt|No. Got a problem with magic in general - illusions, portals, all that. Don't trust any of it.
Syanna|A beau of old-fashioned tastes, eh? I like that.
Geralt|Just curious - why'd you want the Heart of Toussaint? And the ducal wine?
Syanna|They were my right. My due.
Geralt|Doubt we would've figured you out if you hadn't tried to get them. Know that, don't you?
Syanna|I do… and I regret nothing. One lives but once.
Nilfgaardian Emissary Man 02|Such exquisite robes the world's never seen!
Nilfgaardian Emissary Man 02|My new attire reveals itself but to the wise and cultivated!
Nilfgaardian Emissary Man 02|Stunning, are they not? My new robes? Absolutely stunning!
Geralt|Four animals stacked atop each other… What was the tale called again?
Syanna|"The Musicians of Blaviken." Huh… you've some link to the town as well, don't you?
Geralt|Mhm. But my tale's not much like this one.
Syanna|Oh, Geralt, Geralt… and they call me cruel.
Geralt|Incredible… You must have loved this place.
Syanna|I did, at first. But children get bored quickly. Even tea parties with a whole cackle of princesses eventually turn dull and routine.
Geralt|What'd you do then?
Syanna|Dropped a duck egg in the swans' nest once. That sort of thing. Stole the pea out from under the princess, who sleeps to this day, I think.
Geralt|Did you like Anna Henrietta?
Syanna|Do you jest? I adored her. My darling little sis. So adorable! So sweet!
Syanna|Yet when they banished me from the palace… she didn't so much as peek out of the window.
Geralt|She might not have known. Maybe just couldn't.
Syanna|And could she also not grant me amnesty once she was crowned? Please.
Syanna|Did you really travel all the way here for a contract?
Geralt|Nature of the job.
Syanna|I don't believe it. You must have had another reason.
Geralt|Hm, well… spent a few idyllic months in Beauclair some time past. Part of me wanted to come back, I think.
Syanna|Oh, yes. Visit Toussaint once, and you'll always long to return.
Geralt|Eye of Nehaleni's going wild… Whole land's an illusion, but so powerful there's no way to dispel it.
Toussaint Boy 03|Someone… someone's eaten from our bowls!
Syanna|Oh, look! The Emperor of Nilfgaard! He's come out to show off his new robe.
Syanna|Recognize it? Once upon a time, a terrible dragon attacked Vizima. It took a clever young cobbler to bring about its defeat.
Geralt|Right. Every now and again some village idiot tries to imitate him… and I gotta come in to clean up the mess.
Geralt|Just one thing in its gut - a half-digested sheep… stuffed with tar and sulfur. Of course.
Geralt|But no bean.
Syanna|Does that not disgust you? Poking about in a rotting corpse?
Geralt|Compared to the time I fought a zeugl in Vizima's sewers, this…
Geralt|Ah, never mind. Don't feel like telling that story again.
Syanna|Damned territorial, those fur balls… Ptooey!
Toussaint Noble Woman 03|Hey! Watch it!
Syanna|You stepped on Thumbelina! That was my favorite tale!
Geralt|Hm… why's that?
Syanna|Because it wasn't about a princess. Tales about princesses are insufferable.
Syanna|Quite the view, wouldn't you say?
Geralt|Whoa. That should be interesting.
Beauclair Thug Weak 02|Harlot-bred vandal! Get him!
Syanna|Watch out! Pixies!
Geralt|Not the friendliest pixies I've met.
Syanna|They were put here to protect the Fablesphere from intruders. Meaning you.
Geralt|Will-o'-the-wisp… Think it's got something to show us.
Syanna|Careful. It is not to be trusted.
Geralt|Another will-o'-the-wisp…
Geralt|Knight's strange. Doesn't look like he's out of any fairytale I know. Wonder how he got here.
Syanna|In past times, Anarietta and I would occasionally run into them here. You see, knights errant far outnumber princesses in the real world, so some knights would sneak into the playroom, then into this land. In search of their fairytale damsels, that's all.
Geralt|Only to be shredded to bits by a swarm of pixies… Irony's delicious.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Contract from a goose. That's new.
Syanna|Do you really aim to concern yourself with that?
Geralt|A true witcher should never abandon poultry in distress.
Geralt|Hmm. Doesn't seem to be at home.
Syanna|Perhaps she left some tracks behind? Go on, use those kitty-cat eyes.
Geralt|A feather… broken. There was a fight.
Geralt|Goose feathers… must've been flapping its wings. Or did it just get plucked?
Syanna|Hey, there, in the trees! Some kind of camp?
Toussaint Bandit Strong 06|Defend the goose! The golden eggs will be ours!
Toussaint Bandit Strong 06|The goose is ours! Her golden eggs as well!
Syanna|But why keep her in a cage? Eggs from free range birds are so much better. Ah well. Where's the key?
Geralt|Here it is. Got it.
Toussaint Bandit Strong 06|You mean to cross the barbarous Barbarossa? Not on your life!
Geralt|Good thing you posted that notice. Never would've found you, otherwise.
Goose|Honk honk honk honk!
Syanna|Look! She laid a golden egg for you! Haha!
Geralt|Heh. If only all my employers were that generous…
Geralt|Would've preferred a magic bean, but not about to complain.
Goose|Honk honk honk honk!
Geralt|You're welcome.
Goose|Honk honk honk honk!
Geralt|Legs? In ruby red slippers?
Syanna|From a tale about a wizard from Ofier. You might not know it.
Goose|Honk honk honk honk!
Geralt|Outdated. Already freed the goose.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|The big bad witcher huffed and puffed… and look. Got a bean.
Syanna|It cannot be!
Geralt|What cannot be?
Syanna|You actually have a sense of humor.
Geralt|Hm. Why so shocked?
Syanna|Well, when you arrived, all you did was pout and mumble things in that gravelly monotone…
Syanna|And now this. A jest. And a good one at that.
Syanna|But, here we are chatting away when there's work to do!
Syanna|We must keep looking.
Syanna|The beans won't plant themselves, you know.
Geralt|Stunted a bit, but yeah, it's there.
Syanna|Well, well, aren't you full of surprises. What else are you hiding behind that gruff exterior?
Geralt|Not a bad singer. Do a pretty mean rendition of "The Maids of Vicovaro," for instance… but some other time, maybe.
<|endoftext|>
Syanna|So?
Geralt|Got the bean, but Longlocks… hm. Seems she got sick of waiting for a knight in shining armor.
Syanna|Can you blame her? Men these days… dandies and fops, all.
Geralt|That why you cozied up to a vampire?
Syanna|Dettlaff… was a tool. And only a tool.
Geralt|Too bad he didn't know that.
Syanna|I trust no one. Learned that long ago. Now it's his turn.
Geralt|Got a history with Dettlaff, now, so this meeting'll be different. Not afraid?
Syanna|I can handle him.
Geralt|Mhm. Sure about that?
Syanna|You look at him as a witcher and see a monster. I… I know what he's really like. You needn't worry.
Syanna|It's time to go. Just a bit more work and we'll be able to say sod off to this fecking Fablesphere.
Syanna|It's time we moved on. Come.
Geralt|To use him - was that your plan from the start?
Syanna|No. At first I was simply intrigued. Do you know the story?
Syanna|It was in Metinna, a few years past. I'd gone there to pass some loot off to a fence I know.
Syanna|We were hashing out the terms, when in walked Dettlaff. He said he'd come to sell a silver candlestick. He gripped it through a cloth. That caught my eye.
Syanna|I followed him out, observed him from a distance… but he caught on quickly.
Geralt|Yeah. Superhuman senses'll do that.
Syanna|He turned down a blind alley. I followed. He jumped out from behind a crate, baring his teeth. I suppose he'd wanted to frighten me… Alas, he didn't in the least. After all, I'm a monster too, am I not?
Geralt|What happened then?
Syanna|We talked. Then met up - once, twice, three times… enough that he became infatuated.
Syanna|I truly enjoyed it at first. But only at first. He did not love like a man, but like an animal. Madly, deeply, unconditionally. Wildly.
Syanna|To return such a feeling - anyone would be hard pressed… Let alone someone as twisted as I am.
Geralt|So, there came a day you just up and disappeared.
Syanna|Yes. There was no other way. "Let's just be friends," or "I don't deserve you" - he'd never have understood that sort of thing.
Syanna|But then, once I'd decided to return, clean up some old affairs… I remembered him. And concluded he could still be of use.
Geralt|Playing with fire, that.
Syanna|Definitely. And either I'll get burned, or I'll burn all else down. No other options.
Geralt|A higher vampire and you were unimpressed? Don't know if that's brave or just plain foolish.
Syanna|I've always had a way with ostensibly dangerous quiet types.
Geralt|That supposed to about me, too?
Syanna|Oh bother - I hate to disappoint you, Geralt, but your belly button is not the center of the known world. Though, you do remind me of him a bit - stifling all emotions inside you, ever feigning indifference.
Syanna|You see, when I met Dettlaff, I… somehow I knew - call it intuition - that he meant me no harm. That he was trying to frighten me off for he, too, was scared. Now do you understand?
Geralt|I guess.
<|endoftext|>
Beauclair Bastard 01|They'll not have my blood! Never!
Beauclair Bastard 01|If I can just last the night…
Beauclair Bastard 02|Tell me, witcher, should I go at them with a stake? Or use temple-sanctified water?
Beauclair Bastard 02|Deliver us, gods, from all fleders, bruxae and alps…
Beauclair Bastard 03|That one, is he no vampire? He's pale… and has strange eyes.
Beauclair Bastard 03|This is punishment for our many sins.
Beauclair Bastard 04|A silver sword? You must fight vampires with fire, that's what my nonni said!
Beauclair Bastard 04|The palace awash with blood… Great gods.
Beauclair Thug Strong 01|That's enough! We cannot hope to carry more!
Beauclair Thug Weak 01|Shut your trap! You'd do better to keep a keen eye out for beasts. Or the Guard.
Beauclair Thug Strong 02|Shhhh.
Beauclair Thug Strong 01|He'll tell the Guard! He's got to die!
Beauclair Thug Strong 02|Many folk have died today. What's another corpse? No one'll give it a second thought.
Beauclair Thug Weak 01|Lovely, that armor! More loot once we're done with you!
Geralt|Dammit. Swarms of 'em. Probably better to go around.
Geralt|No way I'll get through there in one piece…
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Help! Help! Save me!
Toussaint Knight 01|Thanks… I would doubtless lie dead now were it not for your aid.
Toussaint Knight 01|A true champion slayer, you are. I thank you.
Toussaint Knight 08|The beasts, I could barely see them. Gods, had you not come along… I…
Toussaint Knight 08|Champion! Thanks be to the gods, the gods reward you!
Toussaint Knight 09|Ooph… I owe you my life, I do…
Toussaint Knight 09|Our champion! He'll fell the beasts, save all our skins!
Geralt|Stay here, hunker down till dawn. Breath slowly, shallow breaths. Wont' be able to hear you, then. Understand?
Toussaint Boy 04|Y-y-yes.
<|endoftext|>
Handsome Jack|Ey there! Geralt of Rivia!
Geralt|What do you want?
Handsome Jack|Me? Not a thing. Name's Handsome Jacques and I've already got it all. What I wonder is if there's anything you'd need.
Geralt|You know me? How?
Handsome Jack|Know? That's a stretch. No, I wouldn't say that, no. But I do know they've assigned you to the laundry, same as me. And I know what you're in for, your dastardly deed. Then again I know that about every jester who winds up here.
Geralt|Hm. Kinda curious to know what you know, or think you know.
Handsome Jack|The duquessa hired you to find the Butcher of Beauclair. And you did, but then you let him butcher dear Anarietta's sis.
Handsome Jack|Then this brute simply vanished, dropped off the face of the earth, though in his case "turned to vapor" might be the better phrase.
Geralt|Hm. Seem pretty well informed.
Handsome Jack|Best informed mutt in this kennel, paws down. Duquessa's cross, no doubt, while you await your trial. Though she never seemed concerned for her sister before.
Geralt|Since you seem to know so much, tell me one last thing - my sentence, what'll it be?
Handsome Jack|None can tell you that, Anarietta's a fickle cocotte. There's just no knowing which teet she's like to flash.
Handsome Jack|But I'd advise against escape. You're a prisoner among many, now. Take flight, though, make it out - public enemy number one.
Geralt|We gonna report for this laundry duty? Rather get it over with.
Handsome Jack|Away we go. Personally, I'm pleased we're assigned to it. Those rags stink like sick in the sun, but you get used to it. And when you're working, you get more bread.
Geralt|Why'd they lock you up?
Handsome Jack|A hodge-podge. I had no domicile but had to winter somewhere. So I robbed a shopkeeper - couldn't have made a worse mistake. The penalty was a fine, an amount I couldn't pay. So they switched it to lashes, meted out on my bum.
Handsome Jack|After that, I shifted course, started pinching bigwigs' noses. Cut the tail of Count Bovieaux's steed, got a year and half for that. My next exploits had to be grander, even greater wrongs. So I carefully chose my victim - Marshal de Lastaic.
Handsome Jack|Filled his casque with dung from between my very own cheeks. That got me three years of free room and board. I'll pull another prank as soon as they let me out. Made it a career, it's become my way of life.
Handsome Jack|Lucky, then, you managed to cut the murderer down. The court could very well cast a kinder eye on your case.
Geralt|What can you get me, exactly?
Handsome Jack|Exactly? Anything a patron of this little auberge might desire. From decent vittles that won't stew your innards to a dab of fissty to make you fly.
Handsome Jack|Even brought in a slinky piece of arse once. A boarder claimed to suffer from glandular over activity or somesuch.
Handsome Jack|You see, out there beyond the walls, I'm a lowly dogsbody. But here in the klingdom of the clink, I'm the kling.
Geralt|Can't readily think of anything.
Handsome Jack|Come, now, mate. We all need something. You've just not been in here long enough to know.
<|endoftext|>
Prisoner 01|Know what they're slopping up for supper tonight?
Prisoner 02|I've no clue. But we're better off chomping grass the way that canteen reeks.
Prisoner 01|The bleeding bumwipes! And to think they locked me up for selling rancid food.
Prisoner 02|Nors, what you were selling had no right to be called food. That was worse than rat poison.
Prisoner 01|Rubbish! Well-aged meat, that's all it was!
Prisoner 02|Hah! Your aged meat had half of Toussaint galloping to the privy!
Prisoner 01|That's because our courtiers have the bellies of colicky newborns.
Prisoner 02|Should have sold your slop to peasants, then.
Prisoner 01|Are you daft? First, peasants make their own food, and second, nobles pay a spit load more.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Why not.
Prisoner 01|Lay them out, then.
Geralt|Another time, maybe.
Prisoner 01|So, off-poff-poff with you.
Prisoner 01|You fleeced me, harlotsbrood. Now Stefan will have to go hungry.
Geralt|Sorry.
Prisoner 01|Oh, look at that, he's sorry.
Prisoner 02|No one else will play with you in this coop. And be careful not to slip on any soap.
Geralt|Oh, I will.
Prisoner 01|You sure bumbotched that. You're too dumb to win at jailhouse gwent.
Geralt|Entitled to your opinion.
Prisoner 01|That's no opinion, that's a fact. Now hand over the rag. I'm done playing you. Waste of my diddling time.
Prisoner 01|Stop your ogling, this is no cabaret. Will you play or not?
Geralt|What's the stake?
Prisoner 01|Look at this, not two fleas to his name and he asks about stakes. You can bet those rags you're wearing.
Geralt|What'll I get if I win?
Prisoner 01|Bread. I put some aside for Stefan, but it won't kill him to go hungry.
Geralt|Who's Stefan?
Prisoner 01|None of your rotten business. A rat. So, playing?
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Bandit Strong 03|Who have we here…?
Toussaint Bandit Weak 01|The guardian of guttersnipes, locked in the clink. How did that happen?
Toussaint Bandit Weak 02|My, my… What could the duchess' favorite have done to deserve this?
Geralt|Back off, I'm busy.
Toussaint Bandit Weak 01|Hear that? The laundry wench is busy. Yet I fear we have a matter to resolve. Remember our meeting, bootblack bodyguard?
Handsome Jack|You go ahead and chit, I'll be back once you're done.
Geralt|Huh. Thanks for sticking around to help, Jacques.
Handsome Jack|You're in the coop, mate, only one thing counts here - survival. Folk don't stick their necks out, for anyone besides themselves.
Toussaint Bandit Weak 01|Boohoo. He left you all alone.
Geralt|Got lucky once. Shoulda quit while you were ahead.
Toussaint Bandit Weak 01|Grab your washboards, boys! Let's show this git who does the scrubbing around here.
Geralt|Seems fools never learn. Let's get this over with.
Geralt|Worry about yourselves. Managed to knock me down once, sure… but that was an accident. I promise.
Toussaint Bandit Weak 01|An accident, you say? Well, those happen all the time. And some men are just prone to them. As you very well might be.
Toussaint Bandit Weak 02|Apart from which, we would not be here if not for you. So think of us as the trap you set for yourself, an accident waiting to happen.
Toussaint Bandit Weak 01|Oh, we've been dreaming of this - a miracle by which you would land in here. And voila! Sometimes dreams do come true.
Geralt|Worry about yourselves. Tried me once already, remember? Didn't work out well, far as I recall. Why tempt fate?
Toussaint Bandit Strong 03|We're changed men. Prison does that to you.
Toussaint Bandit Weak 02|And you're the one who put us here.
Geralt|Come on. Be constructive. Make yourselves useful.
Toussaint Bandit Weak 01|Yes… we should see to the wash, or they'll put us in confinement.
Toussaint Bandit Strong 03|Hey! The mutant's trying charms on us - can't you see? Your tricks won't work here, lad. You cannot mesmerize all three of us at once.
Toussaint Bandit Strong 03|Grab yourselves washboards, boys!
<|endoftext|>
Beauclair Bastard 01|What is going on here?!
Toussaint Bandit Strong 03|Is something not in order, sir?
Beauclair Bastard 01|Why's this man on the floor?
Toussaint Bandit Strong 03|Perhaps you should ask him that.
Beauclair Bastard 01|Why are you lying there?
Geralt|Taking a rest. First day in the laundry. Didn't realize it could be so tiring.
Beauclair Bastard 01|Harlotsbroods. Solitary for the lot of you. You'll have ample time to consider, think about the choices you've made in life. I'll make certain of it.
Geralt|Didn't do anything to deserve solitary.
Beauclair Bastard 01|Shut it!
Beauclair Bastard 01|Milton was my cousin. You let him die. Was the duquessa's coin not enough? Did you expect more to save a good man's life?
Geralt|Arrived too late. Nothing I could do.
Beauclair Bastard 01|And when the Beast tore apart the duquessa's sister? Too late then, too? Were it up to me, you'd have hanged already.
Beauclair Bastard 01|And don't you try any witcher tricks on me. You will end oh so badly if you do.
Geralt|Nothing.
Beauclair Bastard 01|I am not asking you, but the one on the floor. Have you anything to say?
Toussaint Bandit Strong 03|I slipped on some soap.
Beauclair Bastard 01|You slipped. On soap…
Toussaint Bandit Strong 03|Lots of soap here - it is a laundry…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Here of your own free will, Stefan? Or did they lock you up, too?
Geralt|Bet you're thinking about food, what you'll eat once you're free.
Geralt|Mutton leg, that's what I'm dreaming of. Well-roasted on the outside, nice and juicy in the middle…
Beauclair Bastard 03|Are you the lout from Rivia?
Geralt|Yep, I'm that lout.
Beauclair Bastard 03|Come with me. You're to be sentenced.
Geralt|To what?
Beauclair Bastard 03|To shut it. What am I, the town crier? Hands behind your back.
Beauclair Bastard 03|Now let's go. And no funny business.
<|endoftext|>
Beauclair Bastard 03|I've brought the prisoner, sir.
Damien|Unbind him. And leave us.
Damien|Greetings, witcher.
Geralt|Your face… doesn't look good.
Geralt|What happened?
Damien|The city was overrun, and I had no intention of hiding beneath my bed and waiting things out.
Damien|But my scars pale in comparison to the fate Syanna met with. The fate that was your doing.
Damien|I trusted you. And how did you repay me? Consider it, witcher - why do you think the duquessa had Syanna hidden away to start with? Can you guess?
Geralt|I'm sorry. Might not believe me, but… couldn't have predicted that turn of events. Certainly never wanted that.
Damien|Enough. We shall speak of it no more.
Geralt|Guess there's been a decision in my case.
Damien|Truly? Is that all you care about? Your own hide?
Geralt|Get kinda anxious when my life's on the line.
Damien|Your life was never threatened. The court considered various punishments, the death sentence was not among them.
Geralt|Wasn't in attendance, so I wouldn't know.
Damien|You are in Toussaint, where the rule of law holds. We do not allow lynchings here, and every case is analyzed in minutest detail.
Damien|The facts are as follows. You were hired to kill the Beast. Not only did you fail in that endeavor, but you also caused the death of our duquessa's sister. Have I missed anything?
Damien|I'll have you know that were it up to me, you would rot in our dungeon until your dying day.
Geralt|Glad you didn't have the deciding vote, then.
Damien|At any rate… I am not the best person to tell you what was decided in your matter. I'd say the man who worked hardest to tip the scales in your favor should.
Geralt|What're you talking about? What man?
Geralt|Dandelion?!
Dandelion|Sheesh, Geralt, you look like you've seen a ghost.
Geralt|A ghost wouldn't have surprised me half this much, I promise you. What're you doing in Beauclair?
Dandelion|Officially? Visiting Anarietta-- That is to say, the duchess. We're old friends - ah, but you know that. Unofficially? I'm saving your hiney.
Geralt|You? You're a persona non grata in Toussaint. Undesirable.
Dandelion|Didn't stop me from risking my skin for you. In my book, friendship is all that matters. Well, friendship and love. And art. Oh, and wine…
Geralt|Take it I'm free thanks to you… how'd you manage it?
Dandelion|Oh, I have my ways. Took a little persuasive logic, blended in some deft rhetoric, then added a generous pinch of charm, and voila - you're free.
Dandelion|But just so you know, it wasn't easy. In fact, it was pretty damn hard.
Dandelion|Duchess was so furious, I think she even forgot she'd banished me from Beauclair. For life. All she could do was scream that you'd never set foot outside that dungeon again.
Geralt|How'd you get her to take a fresh look at things?
Dandelion|I appealed to the faultless intentions that guided you, to your reputation, your accomplishments and… well, ultimately, she changed her mind, and you're free. Never wants to see you again, but…
Dandelion|Even got her to leave your vineyard with you. You won't get a copper of your promised reward, but you'll keep your estate.
Geralt|Dandelion, you're a regular master of diplomacy. Thanks.
Dandelion|Listen, you do whatever needs doing, but I've got to get to the cemetery. Anarietta's in bad shape with Syanna dead.
Dandelion|Some folk forget that under the ducal regalia she's just an ordinary woman who's lost a loved one.
Geralt|All right, see you later.
Dandelion|See you, Geralt.
Beauclair Bastard 03|Off we go. You'll collect your things at the door.
Geralt|Meant to ask… Priscilla - how is she?
Dandelion|Not well, unfortunately. After you left Novigrad, this one day, Priscilla was attacked. In the street.
Dandelion|She was wounded badly, took a long time to recover. Luckily, she's better now.
Geralt|What are you talking about? Who the hell attacked her?
Dandelion|Still looking for the bastard who hurt her. Once I find him, he'll regret what he did, regret the day he was born.
Geralt|Sorry, Dandelion. Sorry I wasn't around.
Dandelion|Got your own problems, your own priorities. Can't expect you to be at my side whenever anything goes wrong. Besides, it's Priscilla, so I need to handle this.
Geralt|Been meaning to ask you - how's Priscilla?
Dandelion|All right. Recovering steadily from the horrors she's been through.
Geralt|So you two… you're still…?
Dandelion|Of course we are! How could you even think it was otherwise?
Geralt|No idea, just… within the realm of possibilities. But please be careful not to lead Anna Henrietta on, suggest you've come here for any reason beyond getting me out of my predicament.
Dandelion|The bond between the duchess and myself is one of pure friendship, nothing more. Now, off to console a friend in need.
Geralt|Mind being just a little more specific?
Dandelion|Geralt, you were summoned here to hunt down and destroy the Beast of Beauclair. You undeniably did just that. Facts spoke for themselves, by and large.
Geralt|Then why the hell'd they throw me in prison?
Dandelion|Specifically? Due to the duchess' sister's untimely demise. But I convinced Anarietta to treat that as a separate matter. After all, your contract said nothing about protecting Syanna.
Dandelion|Thus, you will not only keep your vineyard, but you'll also receive a portion of the remuneration you're owed for killing the Beast of Beauclair.
Geralt|Dandelion, you're one clever little rascal.
Dandelion|I'd do anything for a friend.
Geralt|Thanks.
Geralt|How'd you even know I was in prison?
Dandelion|Regis came to see me right after they locked you up. I mean, Regis, right? Can you believe that? To come back after…?! Amazing. He told me everything and, naturally, I couldn't possibly leave you to rot in there.
Damien|It was a difficult case to decide. True, you killed the Beast of Beauclair, but you failed to prevent the death of Sylvia Anna - our duquessa's sister.
Geralt|Not only. Also care how the duchess feels, for example. And I hope that, unlike you, she doesn't blame this all on me.
Damien|A court heard your case, not Anna Henrietta.
Geralt|Though, looked even worse last time I saw you.
Damien|Agh. I apply an arnica extract. I can hardly feel it anymore.
Geralt|Fine, see what he has to say. Could use a good walk. Work out the kinks, if nothing else.
Regis|Come, then.
Geralt|Guess it wouldn't hurt to talk to him… But let's meet there. Wanna look around town first, work out some kinks…
Regis|Acceptable, I suppose. I shall await by the bootblack's stand.
Geralt|Know what I say to that, Regis? Those murders don't interest me anymore. A drink, though - that's another matter.
Regis|Then I invite you to join me for one. I'm certain to dig up a flask. Or two. Or three.
Geralt|Don't smile so wide. Someone's liable to see, could mean trouble.
Regis|I can't help myself. Just so glad to see you.
Geralt|Glad to see you too, my vampire friend.
Geralt|What'd you do while I, uh…?
Regis|While you vegetated in that correctional facility? I used the time to think. Wish to know what I thought about?
Geralt|Course…
Regis|The relationship between two numbers - Dettlaff's four victims and the Five Chivalric Virtues. As you've no doubt noted, there's a difference of one.
Geralt|Mean to tell me, after all we've figured out, that you now believe in the whole Five-Virtues-Punished theory?
Regis|Belief's got nothing to do with it. It's cold logic, deduction. Syanna went to great lengths to make folk believe the Beast was punishing those who betrayed the Virtues.
Regis|Were I in her shoes, I'd make sure the number of victims matched. Are you not at all curious who was meant to be the fifth?
Geralt|If I say yes, what then?
Regis|Then you'll come with me for another chat with the bootblack. You see, I've learned he delivered the notes to Dettlaff. Our search starts with him.
Geralt|Thanks for getting Dandelion to come out.
Regis|It was nothing. True, he was not at first terribly eager to face the duchess… but I managed to persuade him his person was indispensable.
Geralt|Well played. Dandelion loves being indispensable.
Regis|Yet he so rarely is, poor man.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Wouldn't 'ave come if I didn't have to, promise you that. But I've learned something, something that might interest Anna Henrietta.
Damien|Hm. Forgive me if I lend no credence to your word.
Geralt|Found a letter Syanna wrote… to the murderer.
Damien|Hm. Very well. You may enter. But I make no promises as regards the duquessa. She mourns her sister in the ducal crypt. Viscount de Lettenhove is with her.
Dandelion|Remember, my dear Anarietta, despair is like a stormy sky. Sooner or later, the sun must drive away the clouds.
Anna Henrietta|That is easy for you to say. The one murdered was not your sister.
Dandelion|My life hasn't exactly been a bed of roses. True, my sister wasn't murdered, don't even have a sister, actually, but many times I've lost… Ugh, unimportant.
Geralt|Your Grace…
Anna Henrietta|The impudence you must harbor to come in here after all that's happened!
Dandelion|Calm down, I'm sure Geralt's got a very good reason. Right, Geralt?
Geralt|Didn't come here to upset you, m'Lady. Just… found this letter and thought you, if anyone, oughta read it, know what it says.
Anna Henrietta|You are not one to tell me what I should or should not do.
Geralt|Syanna wrote it. To the murderer.
Dandelion|Really? Maybe you should read it, then. It could be important…
Anna Henrietta|You read it, Dandelion. Aloud, to me.
Dandelion|"This time you must see to our duquessa. Anna Henrietta knows nothing of empathy. Her heart is cold. This shard of ice you must tear from her breast."
Anna Henrietta|My sister could never have written that.
Geralt|Got proof she did.
Anna Henrietta|No… I don't believe you, I don't believe it. Someone seeks to blacken her in my eyes. I won't allow it.
Dandelion|There, there, Anarietta. Don't get upset.
Anna Henrietta|The letter is vile, it's slander! You must destroy it, do you hear?! No one else must ever read it! Ever!
Dandelion|Consider it done…
Anna Henrietta|And you - out! Get out of here! This is all your doing! Begone, hear me?! I never wish to see you again!
Anna Henrietta|I shall never believe she did this! She was not capable! This is an outrage! Dandelion, tell him it's not true! Tell him it's a dirty lie…
Dandelion|Geralt, get out of here, please? The duchess, she needs to be alone…
Geralt|Before you start dumping accusations on me, think you should know something. Syanna… she was a vicious, wicked, woman.
Anna Henrietta|Who are you to tell me who my own sister was?!
Geralt|I'm the man you hired to investigate the Beast of Beauclair. And I found a letter your sister wrote to the murderer.
Damien|I did not think you'd show again. Need I remind you? The duquessa's sister lies dead due to your negligence. Yet still you have the gall to come?
Damien|Geralt? Why have you come? Forgotten already? The murderer you were to kill lives, while the duquessa's sister lies dead.
<|endoftext|>
Regis|My, what a smashing ensemble. You wear it well.
Geralt|Shut up. I look like a twit.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|The caftan is sewn of the best fabrics available and according to the best tailoring practices.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|But one must have a modicum of taste to appreciate this. Even the most exquisite robes cover only deficiencies in beauty - never in refinement.
Geralt|Rather not bicker about taste. Don't like to. It's neither interesting nor productive.
Regis|This particular witcher has an inborn intolerance for formal occasions. Yet he's to attend just such an event shortly. I expect that's the source of his prickliness.
Regis|So, try not to take things personally, master tailor. Rather pity him, for in truth stage fright overwhelms him. He trembles at the thought that he has no notion how to behave in the presence of Her Grace's majesty.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Hmm. As well he should.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|All that being as it may, Toussaint's highest honor, the Order of Vitis Vinifera, demands appropriate attire.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|The duchess cannot be expected to drape the medal on a suit of armor caked in mud. Palace protocol places enormous emphasis on form, virtuous tradition, etiquette…
Regis|Hmph, a tradition which values appearances ahead of all else, which calls for lordly, glistening triviality and misplaced generosity…
Geralt|Hm, ceremonies, medals honoring virtues… Just keep coming up…
Regis|I've had no reprieve, either. And I keep thinking of the last great virtue - compassion… It's the one piece of the puzzle that never seemed to fit.
Geralt|Mean you suddenly believe the Five Virtues theory? After all we've revealed?
Regis|It's not a question of belief, superstition or old wives' tales. It's a conclusion derived through exercising pure logic.
Regis|Syanna planned everything in advance. Had we not stopped her, surely there'd have been a fifth victim. One the gossips would have associated with a lack of compassion.
Geralt|Her plans don't matter now - can't act on them. Asked the messenger who delivered my invitation to the ceremony. Syanna's in the palace. Courtiers pressured the duchess to lock her in a tower.
Regis|Do you care not a whit who else was in her black book? We've some time before the ceremony. We could still chat with that boot-cleaning urchin.
Regis|He was the one to pass the victims' names to Dettlaff… Perhaps we missed something?
Geralt|All in all, why not check up on that? We'll go together - assuming we're done here?
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|I am done, yes. It lies in your hands now - to see if you are able to present my handiwork at the ceremony with the dignity it is due.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Or if you will first destroy it, crawling about the city's underbelly.
Geralt|Promise to be careful.
Geralt|Could be worth checking with the bootblack again. Meet you by his stand.
Regis|Fine. I shall await you there, shoot the breeze with the charming lad to pass the time.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|The bootblack? In the lower city? Intend to soil my masterpiece in the city's gutters?
Geralt|Promise to be careful.
Geralt|Wine vapors in the air must've gone to your head, Regis. It's over, Dettlaff's dead. Won't be any more murders.
Regis|You're entitled to your opinion. I, however, will check this. Should you change your mind, you know where to find me.
Geralt|Regis, bootblack didn't say anything about making deliveries when we talked to him. How do you know he handled the letters?
Regis|While you basked in glory and tried on new formal wear, I conducted a little investigation of my own. You'd be very proud to see how I conducted myself.
Regis|I began by concocting an ample supply of boot wash for our enterprising young friend.
Regis|I'd observed that among street folk, amidst their society as a whole, reciprocity takes precedence over all other codes and thus no good deed goes unrewarded.
Regis|Of course, the same holds true for malicious or destructive deeds.
Geralt|The letters - what's the connection?
Regis|When the bootblack arrived to collect his bucketful, he hinted he knew more. Simply put, we'd failed to ask the proper questions when we'd chatted earlier. It took a bit more tongue-loosening, but ultimately he spoke.
Regis|He admitted he'd handed Dettlaff the letters. He knew this information was valuable to me. In providing it, he was simply repaying me.
Geralt|Sound wistful, pensive, Regis. That because they refused to buy you a new outfit?
Regis|Hardly. It's the tone I ever adopt when I find myself pondering. Which, believe it or not, happens quite a lot.
Regis|Besides, I've no need for a new outfit as I shall not be attending the ceremony.
Geralt|Why not?
Regis|Because unlike you, I don't have to. I shall begin to pack my belongings, instead. I trust you'll join me later, once you're richer by a medal and a fascinating new experience?
Geralt|Count on it.
Geralt|Usually wear something different, better suited to my trade. Got nothing against this particular outfit, though.
Geralt|Just don't exactly feel comfortable in it. And I despise formal occasions.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Hmph, nothing one can't get accustomed to. Now, be so kind as to stand still.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Need to ask you something.
Toussaint Boy 01|Yet again? Go on, then - I'm a proponent of free speech and will gladly tell you all I know. But why not get your boots shined while we jabber?
Geralt|Not wearing boots just now, but guess I could pull a pair on.
Regis|Then I shall take advantage as well. A friend of mine used to say boots should be as clean as the souls that wear them.
Toussaint Boy 01|Clean boots - clean souls ! A fine slogan!
Geralt|Man in the frock coat - you passed him some letters. Remember?
Toussaint Boy 01|Why, of course. I'm young, got a mind like a steel trap. But…
Geralt|If you're about to tell me this information'll cost me, forget it.
Geralt|How'd you get those letters?
Toussaint Boy 01|Beggars brought them.
Geralt|Beggars… tell us more about them? How many were there?
Toussaint Boy 01|Why… four. One for each letter.
Geralt|Just four? Sure you didn't get a fifth?
Toussaint Boy 01|I can count, you know.
Geralt|Remember anything else? These beggars have anything in common?
Toussaint Boy 01|What? Come, now, each was different. Some had mismatched boots, others had no boots at all…
Toussaint Boy 01|Oh! I know! They all had no home!
Geralt|Kid, my patience is starting to run a little thin. Now think hard…
Geralt|Where'd they get the letters? They pick them up, get them from someone?
Toussaint Boy 01|I don't know. They'd come, hand me a letter and walk away. I asked no questions.
Regis|Geralt, allow me to ask a question… Listen, lad. I'll be glad to mix another batch of that boot shine for you…
Regis|But you must focus now and tell us all you know. Where can we find the beggars?
Toussaint Boy 01|Well, at the shelter, most like.
Geralt|Where's that?
Toussaint Boy 01|Everyone knows. It's just 'round the corner. Up those stairs, then right.
Regis|Thanks, kid. For your trouble.
Geralt|Remember what they looked like?
Toussaint Boy 01|Of course! I've a mind like a steel trap, as I said. They were ragged, unshaved. Their clothes were tattered. As to their boots, well, I mentioned that already.
Geralt|Why didn't you tell us this before, when we first talked?
Toussaint Boy 01|You didn't ask about beggars, now did you?
Geralt|How's business?
Toussaint Boy 01|Well enough, I can't complain. Though it'd be even better were certain folk to sit down for a shine as they stood and chatted.
Regis|You've made some nice improvements… I'm rather impressed, both pleasing to the eye and functional.
Toussaint Boy 01|Isn't it? And it's all thanks to you! The coin you gave me, I invested it all. Thanks again!
Geralt|You're welcome.
Geralt|Guess they could use a spit and polish.
Regis|The young master and I were just discussing the curious composition of the local soil.
Toussaint Boy 01|Ooh, it's the swordsman. Good to see you, here for a spiffing? Dirty boots are a stain on professional dignity, you know! Step on up!
Toussaint Boy 01|Ooh, it's the chap with the swords. Sir, you look like some beast ate you up, then spat you out. Are you here for a spiffing? Boots make the man, they say! Step on up!
Regis|Geralt! I'm pleased you had a change of heart.
<|endoftext|>
Beauclair Thug Weak 01|You - what do you want?
Geralt|To talk.
Beauclair Thug Weak 01|Here that's a waste of breath! We've tried it, only to tire our lips! We'll use other means of persuasion, now.
Toussaint Poor Man 03|Gentlemen, calm, please…
Beauclair Thug Weak 01|Either get out along with these flea-ridden vagabonds or we'll toss you all out! Our patience is gone. This place is no longer a rank refuse dump!
Beauclair Thug Weak 02|Scram! Decent folk live here.
Geralt|Decent folk you mention - mean yourselves?
Beauclair Thug Weak 01|Why? Do you doubt it?
Geralt|Hell yes.
Beauclair Thug Weak 02|Hear that, Artois? He poking insults us! On our own turf!
Regis|We should step aside, good fellow. My friend is perfectly capable of settling this unfortunate dispute on his own.
Geralt|The shelter, them living here - bothers you. Question is why.
Beauclair Thug Weak 01|Look, Ballard! Another defender of the poor, fighter for justice!
Beauclair Thug Weak 02|Damn nuisance! We've our women and young folk living next door, when even grown men fear to walk past such rabble.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Dammit.
Regis|What is it? Another name, truly?
Geralt|See for yourself.
Regis|Well, well… I… I must say even I did not expect this…
Regis|"This time you will see to our duquessa." It seems we underestimated Syanna rather grossly.
Geralt|Judging by this, Dettlaff was literally supposed to tear her heart out…
Regis|"Yet first you must snap her neck." Puzzling.
Geralt|Duchess was to be Dettlaff's last victim… Syanna planned it from the start.
Regis|Indeed. The logical conclusion, Geralt.
Geralt|Four seemingly random victims to start, the Virtues their only link. Enough to get folk talking about a righteous, vengeful Beast…
Geralt|Obscured the victims' links to Syanna. Even as she had those she despised killed off one by one… leaving the duchess for last.
Regis|Had she managed to fulfill her plan, none would have questioned the reasons, most would have thought Anna Henrietta had died for her sins.
Regis|She was known to show a hard heart on many occasions. Ample proof of a lack of compassion.
Geralt|Why would Syanna murder her own sister? Out of envy? To take power? From an inborn penchant for evil?
Regis|Yes, yes and yes. All seem likely. And none are mutually exclusive. But if you'd like to know for certain, you could always ask her yourself.
Geralt|Actually love to learn her motives.
Regis|Praiseworthy, I suppose. Sometimes one should stare evil in the face.
Geralt|Seems a bit strong. No?
Regis|She used my friend as her tool for killing. I believe I've every right to condemn her. But I support your lust for the truth.
Regis|Some philosophers think empirical examination the sole path to knowledge.
Regis|I believe you mentioned the duchess keeps Syanna locked up?
Geralt|Courtiers were insisting on a harsher punishment, much harsher. Think Anna Henrietta had to protect her sister from a lynch mob as much as she wanted to protect her subjects from a criminal.
Geralt|One way or another, she's locked away in a secluded wing of the palace, awaiting trial before a court of law. I'd need to get past some guards to see her.
Geralt|Coming with?
Regis|Of course not. I shall await you at Mère-Lachaiselongue. I'll not risk entering the palace after Dettlaff and his minions' rampage.
Regis|Besides, I vastly prefer the company of a simple mug of mandrake brew to that of the duchess' vile sister.
Geralt|So, said straight up it means you're going off to get drunk because you hate Syanna.
Regis|I've never been fond of categorical statements of that kind. But I admit I could not vouch for my behavior in her presence.
Regis|She treated Dettlaff cruelly, caused his death in the end. And now this…? Atop all that? No, Geralt. I will not go with you. I will await you at the cemetery.
Geralt|So, meet up once it's over? Assuming you'd rather not see Syanna again…
Regis|You assume correctly. I shall await you at Mère-Lachaiselongue, with a hot mug of mandrake brew to keep me company.
Geralt|Think it's a good idea? After all, we foiled her carefully planned scheme. Think she'll even want to--?
Regis|…Talk to you? Would it harm you in any way to try?
Geralt|Actually, be happy to do that. To look her in the eyes and ask why she wanted to murder her own sister.
Geralt|Hoped I wouldn't have to see her again, ever.
Regis|What can I say? The road to truth is oft muddy, rutted and largely unpleasant.
Geralt|Just like the road to Oxenfurt, then.
Regis|Yes, yes and yes. All those make sense. And none are mutually exclusive.
Geralt|What do we do now?
Regis|Now we drink. Unless, that is, you feel a witcherly duty to see the duchess and tell her what we just learned.
Geralt|Let's go. Haven't had a drink in weeks. Besides, doubt that information'd do the duchess any good.
Regis|Heh. Why not admit you're simply afraid of her reaction?
Geralt|She already locked me up once. Can you blame me?
Regis|I cannot. At times one must abandon grand politics for a bit of simple pleasure. I believe this is one of those times.
Geralt|Ehh, think this might be something Anna Henrietta should now.
Regis|As you wish. I shall await you at Mère-Lachaiselongue, a mug of mandrake brew to keep me company.
Geralt|Not coming with?
Regis|No. After the horror Dettlaff brought down upon the city - and in light of Syanna's death - I think it wiser not to appear at the palace.
Geralt|Probably right. See you later, then.
Regis|Before heading to the palace, you might wish to see if Anna Henrietta is not at the city cemetery. She's spent a great deal of time at her sister's grave these last days.
Geralt|Can only guess what drove Syanna. Luckily Anna Henrietta's safe now.
Regis|I believe we may dare to assume so. Syanna's death was also the death of the duquessa's only natural rival. She is in no danger, for now.
Geralt|Pretty rare thing for a ruler.
Geralt|Puzzle complete now?
Regis|Alas, the matter's ceased to be a tantalizing brainteaser and has turned incredibly grave. We've proof of a plot to assassinate Toussaint's ruler, we've proof of a coup d'état.
Toussaint Poor Man 03|My dears, I've a matter to address before I serve the soup. These two gentlemen have some questions of you. Pay attention, answer in brief, for if you draw it out your soup will go cold. And we wouldn't want that, would we?
Geralt|Recently, four of you delivered sealed letters to the bootblack… I know this.
Toussaint Poor Man 03|Does anyone know what the gentleman means? Go on, speak up. Romain?
Beauclair Beggar 02|Why should I squeal? We were all told not to mention the letters. We all swore.
Toussaint Poor Man 03|You can tell me, Romain. You were given a letter and you delivered it, right? Good work, Romain. Thank you. Who else?
Beauclair Beggar 04|I got one, too. Gave it to the bootblack. And Freshy, he got one. But he can't tell you as he's not here.
Beauclair Beggar 03|I still have mine. I'm to deliver it two days after the Feast of Saint Barnabas.
Geralt|It's a matter of importance to the duchy. Hand it over. Or I'll take it from you, plain and simple.
Beauclair Beggar 03|But I was to deliver it personally, let no one else see it. That is what she said. And she was frightening.
Toussaint Poor Man 03|You ought to heed folk who are kind and honest. These men helped me a short while ago, helped all of us. If this individual threatened you, you need not keep the promise you made.
Beauclair Beggar 03|All right… Take it. I didn't want to see the bootblack anyways. It's always muddy there…
Geralt|I need the letter. It's very important. It's no use to you anymore.
Geralt|Need some information. Looking for a man who might've mentioned the bootblack in Rue de Garles.
Toussaint Poor Man 03|The bootblack? A feisty lad, I know him…
Geralt|Any of your… uh, wards supposed to meet him recently or soon?
Toussaint Poor Man 03|Forgive me, those I help and I are not so close that I would know. But should you wait, they'll all soon come for their meal.
Toussaint Poor Man 03|You can question them yourselves.
Geralt|Thanks. We'll wait. Nice of you to let us.
Geralt|Sure all your usual beggars'll be here?
Toussaint Poor Man 03|They're not obliged to come, of course. But they rarely find a decent meal elsewhere. So almost all in the area eat here.
Geralt|What is this place? Poor house?
Toussaint Poor Man 03|You could call it that. They come here to rest and eat a hot meal.
Geralt|You help 'em why?
Toussaint Poor Man 03|Because they need help.
Toussaint Poor Man 03|I thank you much for your aid… I tried to reason with them, but they'd have beat me blue had you not come along. I'm grateful, immensely.
Geralt|What'd they want from you?
Toussaint Poor Man 03|They are neighbors, wish me to take my folk, the shelter, elsewhere. They dislike that I help the beggars.
Toussaint Poor Man 03|I do not oppose going elsewhere were we to have somewhere to go. But you've come with a problem, have you? My turn to aid you.
Beauclair Thug Weak 01|All right… I can take a hint. Come, time to go.
Regis|Are you well, my friend?
Geralt|Wha… what happened?
Regis|Well, I saw your opponents gain the upper hand, so I took the liberty of jumping in. They shan't bother us anymore. We can now have a calm conversation with the proprietor.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Hey, Syanna. Sorry to intrude, but I gotta ask you something.
Syanna|I've nothing to say to you. You're the one who put me in here, have you forgotten?
Geralt|Sure, but you are here, so what's the harm in talking? Got something better to do?
Syanna|What do you want? Be brief.
Geralt|Went to a place where Beauclair's beggars congregate. Found proof that you'd planned your sister's demise.
Geralt|Anna Henrietta - she was Dettlaff's ultimate target from the start. Your target.
Syanna|Bravo, witcher. I congratulate you on your deductive reasoning skills. But what I'd planned has nothing to do with you.
Geralt|Wrong. Has everything to do with me.
Syanna|You were hired to kill the Beast. Said Beast is dead. So go collect your medal and leave me alone! Why must you meddle in everything?!
Geralt|Regis, he's always saying Dettlaff was more animal-like, less human than him. Might've been so. Dettlaff acted on reflex, was driven by primordial instincts.
Geralt|Whereas you're driven by cruelty, hatred and a lust for vengeance. They hired me to kill the Beast, true. Thing is, something tells me the real Beast is you.
Syanna|You've no notion who I am or what drives me.
Geralt|Not particularly interested in your motives.
Syanna|Of course not. You're all about killing, not listening.
Syanna|I didn't expect you to understand. I need no sympathy, not from you, not from anyone. I regret nothing.
Syanna|If I could turn back time, I'd not decide otherwise at any juncture. They all deserve to be punished. My sister most of all.
Beauclair Bastard 01|Enough. Your visit's done.
Syanna|Ah, thank the stars.
Beauclair Bastard 01|Commander de la Tour would like to see you. Shall we go at once?
Geralt|Let's go. Wanna see him, too.
Geralt|Need to tend to one thing, first. I'll look in on him afterwards.
Beauclair Bastard 01|So be it.
Geralt|Actually came hoping to learn something. It's clear you were out for vengeance. Against those who drove you from the palace? Curse of the Black Sun, that was their reason, right?
Syanna|It's certainly what they claimed… They said I was dangerous. A mutant.
Syanna|Knights… Crespi, du Lac, de la Croix and Peyrac-Peyran - they got the task of whisking me away, abandoning me outside the duchy's borders.
Geralt|They were following orders.
Syanna|So they were, though they did so eagerly. Especially when I tried to flee… Crespi beat me unconscious with a whip. The others stood by and watched.
Syanna|Peyran found ample opportunity to take his frustrations out on me. While du Lac and de la Croix insulted me, mocked me. I swore then I would never forget. I would find them. Find them all.
Geralt|Didn't have it easy, give you that much. Still no excuse for what you did.
Geralt|Hmm. Explains a bit, a lot. You had a right to feel rage, resentment. But those motives aren't enough to justify the means you chose.
Geralt|Just like to know what's going on around me. Can't stand confusion, unexplained situations.
Syanna|Have you come to ask me what drives me? What my motives are?
Geralt|This cell… downright cozy. Second time you've been incarcerated in altogether pleasant conditions. Always seem to land on your feet.
Syanna|I wouldn't say that… I get no privacy here. But it is clean. Because I cleaned it.
Geralt|They do say cleaning can be relaxing.
Syanna|It isn't. It's a horrible, thankless task. But I'm not one to leave anything undone. For instance, before I left Nazair, I also tidied up my room. Even made my bed.
Syanna|I knew I'd never return, but I despise leaving unfinished business, messes, loose ends.
Geralt|Dogged determination. Guess that's admirable.
Syanna|I was praised for it as a little girl… Only for that, in fact.
Geralt|Can't help it, it's who I am. I see someone being cruel, vile, sword just seems to draw itself.
Syanna|You speak as if you've never done anything loathsome yourself.
Geralt|Never intentionally.
Beauclair Bastard 01|Halt!
Geralt|Need to see Syanna. Urgently.
Beauclair Bastard 01|In the matter of…?
Geralt|Need to interrogate her. New facts have come to light. Need them explained. Seems she was planning your duquessa's assassination.
Beauclair Bastard 01|Agh… fine, then. You're that witcher who solved the murders, no? Then you've my permission. But only for a few minutes.
Geralt|Promise to be brief.
Geralt|Wanna talk to her. It's important.
Beauclair Bastard 01|Want to talk? Go see your gran at teatime. Not one locked up on the duquessa's orders. No doing without special permission. Period.
Geralt|Found some information important to her case. Need an explanation. Urgently.
Beauclair Bastard 01|The witcher will speak with the inmate. You can take a momentary break.
Beauclair Bastard 02|As long as it's truly but a moment. Highly irregular, this.
Syanna|Have you come to see how I fare? I'm fine, thank you. Artorius' ribbon worked wonders. It's a shame they took it from me, for--
Geralt|I know who the fifth victim was supposed to be.
Syanna|Goodness, you're simply a compulsive snoop! I'm in prison. Dettlaff is dead… Could you not just drop it?
Geralt|Syanna… Stop pretending you couldn't care less. I know it's an act - and it's really starting to wear.
Geralt|Why'd you want to kill her?
Syanna|Tsk, tsk. For such an accomplished investigator to ask about the obvious…? Come, now, Geralt. Why do you think?
Geralt|How should I know? Might really be the Curse of the Black Sun. Word is cursed princesses often kill their own families.
Syanna|I see I misjudged you. You understand nothing.
Syanna|Well, what now? Off to share your discovery with Anna Henrietta? She's no longer in danger, true, but she very well might add a little something to your reward.
Geralt|Definitely gonna tell her. Not necessarily for the coin, though.
Syanna|Then why do it at all?
Geralt|She oughta know. If only 'cause you'll probably try to kill her again if she ever lets you out.
Syanna|I probably will.
Geralt|Least you're being honest. Finally.
Syanna|Lying only ever makes sense when there's a chance someone will believe you.
Syanna|It's actually refreshing, in a way - to say what I truly think. So why don't I do a bit more?
Syanna|I was only ever nice to you to get you to sleep with me. I thought you might come in handy one day.
Syanna|Your comrade Regis is using you. And Anna Henrietta perceives you solely as her unthinking, blunt instrument. She's right to, you know.
Geralt|I like this game. Long as we're being honest, here I go - you're a pathetic, self-centered snake.
Geralt|Should I go on? You'll rot in this tower. You'll die of old age. Embittered, alone and forgotten. By everyone.
Geralt|Have a nice life, Syanna.
Geralt|Enjoy hurting people, that it? Sorry, but won't give you the satisfaction. The witcher mutations, you know. It's hard to draw my blood.
Syanna|Don't worry. I'll find a way.
Syanna|I only slept with you because I thought I could use you one day.
Geralt|Perhaps, just for a second, you could stop dwelling on all the wrongs folk've done you - and forgive her?
Syanna|Why should I?
Geralt|She's your sister, dammit.
Syanna|You know, before they drove me from my home, I received an education befitting one of my status. Music, poetry, arithmetic… As well as logic.
Syanna|So with complete certainty I can state that the opinion "you must forgive your sister because she is your sister" is utter bollocks.
Syanna|No. I will not forgive her. Nor shall I show remorse or promise to improve. Anything else? Or will you finally leave me in peace?
Geralt|For old time's sake. You loved each other, once.
Syanna|Pshh. Please. I don't know who fed you that rubbish, but--
Geralt|Read your governess' diary. You played together, were inseparable. Anarietta'd get you in trouble sometimes, sure… But there were also times she stood up for you. When you had nightmares, only she could calm you.
Geralt|Time eats away at memories, distorts them. Sometimes we only remember the good… sometimes only the bad.
Syanna|If she loved me so, why did she wash her hands of me? Forget me? Hm?
Geralt|Don't know. But you could just ask her instead of sending monsters after her.
Syanna|There's nothing she could say to change what she did to me, to justify it.
Geralt|Maybe. But there's nothing out there to justify what you did to her and all Toussaint. Yet Anna Henrietta hasn't given up on you.
Syanna|Argh… you really want a happy ending, don't you?
Syanna|Ahh, with all of us living happily ever after…
Syanna|Go, witcher. Or they'll give your medal to another. And that would be a shame.
Geralt|Farewell, Syanna.
Syanna|Argh… You meant what you said in the Land of a Thousand Fables. You really want a happy ending to this story, don't you?
Geralt|Syanna… you were exiled when she was how old? Twelve? Thirteen? She was a child.
Geralt|What was she supposed to do? Rebel, organize a coup? Steal your father's seal and forge a pardon?
Geralt|She was powerless. Wiped you from her memory not because she didn't care, but because your departure was traumatic for her. She forgot 'cause that was the only way she could handle the pain.
Geralt|Know what…? Don't feel like talking to you anymore. This is pointless.
Syanna|Finally something we can agree on. Farewell, Geralt.
Geralt|You envy her. Her power, her beauty, the love of her people.
Geralt|Because she turned her back on you. Then banished all memory of you.
Syanna|Bravo, Geralt. Yet another riddle solved - and your sick curiosity sated.
Syanna|Oh, too late to worry about that. The witcher and I have done irregular things aplenty already.
<|endoftext|>
Anna Henrietta|Will you forgive me?
Syanna|I shall never forgive you.
Damien|Geralt of Rivia, slayer of the Beast of Beauclair, step forth. Ahem!
Anna Henrietta|We bestow the distinction upon the witcher who saved Beauclair from the terrible Beast. Such is our desire.
Anna Henrietta|May this symbol serve as a reminder to all that the witcher shall forever remain a friend of Beauclair.
Anna Henrietta|In more familiar terms, now, I thank you immensely, Geralt. Damien has your reward for you. After all, it was but a contract.
Geralt|Thank you.
Anna Henrietta|I've a small surprise for you, in addition. I give you more than a dozen barrels of Sangreal, a wine normally reserved for the ducal table.
Anna Henrietta|The gustatory experience of a lifetime awaits! Are you content?
Geralt|Yes. Very. Heard a lot of good things about that appellation. Thanks again.
Anna Henrietta|Cheers.
Anna Henrietta|In a moment I shall speak to Syanna. Will you assist me?
Anna Henrietta|You returned my sister to me, yet you also showed me her horrendous deeds.
Anna Henrietta|As head of state, I must judge her fairly. But she is my sister, thus my heart bleeds for her…
Geralt|If my presence'll help in any manner, of course I'll stay.
Anna Henrietta|We shall now question a person implicated in the murders which recently ravaged our fair city of Beauclair. Captain de la Tour, show Sylvia Anna in.
Syanna|The witcher will take part in our talk?
Geralt|The duchess requested I be present.
Anna Henrietta|You have committed crimes, grave crimes. Yet you are my sister and my heart does not allow me to treat you as a common criminal.
Anna Henrietta|Thus I have asked Geralt to advise me, as one impartial. I shall now hear what he has to say.
Geralt|No matter the mitigating circumstances, whatever they may be, Syanna is a criminal and should be tried as such.
Geralt|And punished as such. Her guilt is clear.
Anna Henrietta|Your words sadden me greatly, witcher, but I cannot deny their logic.
Anna Henrietta|Syanna… You shall be tried and given a fitting punishment. Yet we shall never cease to be family.
Anna Henrietta|As duchess, I shall have to judge you. But as your sister, I shall never stop loving you.
Geralt|Your Grace, as head of state you should look first and foremost after your dominion.
Geralt|Syanna's actions, what drove them, be damned. She's a threat to your subjects.
Anna Henrietta|You are correct. They are what matters. I must not forget this.
Geralt|Bitterness consumes Syanna. She had cause to resent many of the court of Beauclair. I know her reasons, understand them, even.
Geralt|But I can't condone the actions she chose to take.
Anna Henrietta|What is he talking about, Syanna?
Syanna|You know exactly what! I was forcibly exiled, remember? To your benefit. You knew well the throne would then be yours, though I was the elder!
Syanna|The ministers I can understand. They'd hated me since I was a child, thought me a poor prospect for the wife of a duke.
Syanna|I even understand our parents. I'd always sensed the problem - they simply feared me! For I dared to be free! That fabricated curse, it fell into their laps, a gift from above that brought relief. But you?!
Syanna|Your dagger hurt most. You were my Anarietta, dammit! My darling little sister! Now do you understand, witcher?! She betrayed me!
Geralt|You were children, then. You and your sister both. Had no control over what happened.
Syanna|You're wrong, witcher. She had control. Remember, dear sister, the day they banished me from the palace?
Syanna|Of course, I'd had the idea to pelt the Nilfgaardian envoy with fish bladders… which we filled with rancid suet on a lark.
Syanna|And which you set afire at the last. To impress me, I imagine. And I admit you did. Hit him right in his hideous bald patch!
Syanna|Never laughed so hard in my life… But when it came time to find the culprit, you said not a word. I took all the blame and all the punishment.
Anna Henrietta|It's true… I did not stand up for you. I was too afraid…
Syanna|The council was unanimous. They listed all my offences - my flights from the palace, supposed acts of cruelty, "inappropriate" friendships…
Syanna|They cast me out… But you! The only one to understand me… you cowered in a corner, lifted not a finger to help. Not before, not after. You never tried to find me.
Anna Henrietta|That's not true. I searched for you! Sent out knights, gathered tidings from without… You did not wish to be found.
Anna Henrietta|Since the day you vanished, I have lived with the knowledge that I failed you.
Anna Henrietta|I'm sorry, dear sister… Can you forgive me?
Geralt|Claim to understand them all? Why'd you come back for revenge? Have them all cut down, then?
Syanna|They deserved my vengeance! They detested me, all of them, as long as I can remember! But Anarietta understood me. Once.
Syanna|She was all I could cling to… Her betrayal hurt the most.
Geralt|You Grace, Syanna's guilt is clear. None have cause to doubt it. But before you decide, you should hear her out. The right to a defense is hers, as it applies to all who stand accused.
Anna Henrietta|Nor does it let me believe you sought my demise. My heart yearns to know you were swayed by the monster Dettlaff. You yourself would never stoop so low.
Geralt|I'm not a prisoner. Free to do as I choose.
Anna Henrietta|You returned my sister to me, yet what you tell me now I find devastating. I've come to doubt that I can judge her fairly… I'd far prefer to learn you're mistaken, Geralt.
Geralt|I'm not. In fact, I'd recommend you be particularly careful around her.
Anna Henrietta|You exaggerate, witcher. She is my sister. I know well how to speak to her.
Geralt|Feels like a… second distinction, I'm honored. Thank you.
Anna Henrietta|I trust you shall make good use of it.
Geralt|I am, and truly grateful, Your Grace… Sadly, I'm afraid I have to sour the mood.
Geralt|It's Syanna… she plotted to have you killed, Duchess. Planned to use Dettlaff. You were to be the Beast's fifth victim.
Anna Henrietta|This cannot be true. You're mistaken! You must be!
Geralt|I have proof.
Anna Henrietta|I do not believe it.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|In the guild's name, I beg your assistance, Your Enlightened Highness. Without barrels, production will come to a stop, and it will be the end of us.
Anna Henrietta|You lost them all in the fire? These are horrible tidings. We are most dreadfully saddened.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Yes, Your Enlightened Highness, all. Once the beasts had clawed their way into the warehouse, the whole place went up in flames.
Anna Henrietta|I shall dispatch a palace guardsman to examine the site of the blaze. If things are as you say, fitting compensation shall be paid from the ducal treasury.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Thank you, Your Enlightened Highness.
Damien|Your Grace. Geralt of Rivia has arrived.
Anna Henrietta|My dear subjects! We come now to our next point of business. Of all the duties which fall upon my shoulders as the ruler of this dominion, this duty is dearest to my heart.
Anna Henrietta|For now, we shall award the Order of Vitis Vinifera, Toussaint's highest honor.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|All right. We can start.
Damien|Very well. But you must behave. Less like a hired thug and more like a man deserving of the duchy's highest honor.
Damien|In fact, you'd do best to maintain a dignified silence throughout.
Damien|Very well, let us get things underway. Don your ceremonial attire. Then you'll come with me. Her Grace awaits.
Damien|Let's begin the ceremony. Come with me. The duchess awaits.
Geralt|Your face. Doesn't look good.
Geralt|What the hell happened?
Damien|The city was attacked. Surely you don't imagine I could stand and watch it all from some ivory tower?
Geralt|Though it looked even worse last I saw you.
Damien|I apply a balm of arnica. I hardly feel it anymore.
Geralt|Got some important information. Anna Henrietta was supposed to be Dettlaff and Syanna's fifth victim.
Damien|You are certain of this?
Geralt|Completely. Found proof.
Damien|Inconceivable. How could she?! The murders, the mayhem she brought down on the city - were they not enough? She sought to strike down her own sister?! Her liege? The traitor.
Damien|I must alert my men, enlarge the duchess' honor guard, make certain Sylvia Anna is closely watched during the questioning. I'll see to it personally.
Damien|I thank you, witcher. For alerting me. And I appreciate your attentiveness.
Geralt|Damien.
Damien|Geralt! It's about time. Ready for the ceremony?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Need some flowers, a wreath, or--
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|I've none. Sold everything. I was just on my way out. No sense hanging about with nothing to do.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Should come as no shock, sir. Had the funeral, folk took it all. Men, women, children - all wished to lay a bouquet on the duchess' grave. Windflowers, peonies, gladioli…
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|But she liked common roses best. I know, her ladies-in-waiting would come here at times. I'd choose the loveliest blooms for her - fragrant, big petals, the kind that last a long time.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Ahh… I've still not come to terms with it. To be killed by her own sister… How could it happen?
Geralt|How? Quickly. Unexpectedly. She was gone before I understood what was happening.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Ahh… I know you. You're that witcher from the North. The one that saved us from the Beast.
Geralt|Mhm. Could say that.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Wait here. Take these.
Geralt|Thought you were out of flowers…
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|I put a bouquet aside. I was to take it to her myself. But you have it. I know you held the duchess dear…
Geralt|How much do I owe you?
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Not a copper. Keep your coin and raise a toast in her memory tonight.
Geralt|Do just that. Farewell.
Geralt|No one suspected Syanna'd be merciless. Not Damien, not me… least of all the duchess.
Geralt|Anna Henrietta wanted to believe there was still hope for Syanna, that she'd show remorse… She reached a hand out to her. Too soon. Too trusting.
<|endoftext|>
Damien|Witcher… I was certain you'd departed.
Geralt|Couldn't. Anna Henrietta was…
Damien|Wondrous. Beautiful. Good. The best ruler one could hope to have. Yet I let her down.
Geralt|Don't be so hard on yourself. No one expected Syanna to do that, persist to the end. And none of us did anything to stop her - 'cause there was nothing we could do.
Damien|Ehh, I suppose you are right. But when someone so beloved dies, one cannot help but search one's soul for blame. And even the hardiest knights grow faint-hearted, then.
Geralt|Come to pay my respects, bid the duchess farewell.
Damien|White roses, they were her favorite… Go inside then, she lies in the ducal crypt - in one room with her murderer, despite my protests.
Geralt|What? Who decided that?
Damien|The Regents' Council. A pack of old men who've statutes and codices for hearts. Ducal blood flowed in Syanna's veins and she was never legally disinherited, so they ruled she should lie alongside Anarietta.
Geralt|And all this, what did it bring you…? Rest in peace.
Geralt|I regret it ended this way, that I failed to prevent it… Hope you can forgive me. Rest in peace.
Regis|Stylish crypt, quite subdued. Yes, this is the kind of eternal resting place I dream of.
Geralt|Moments like this, I never know if you're joking or serious…
Regis|Serious, Geralt, serious. It's remarkably peaceful, subtly charming to the hilt - a perfect match for the duchess' dignity.
Regis|Ahh, you humans, you'll never cease to amaze me. To feel despair in the face of natural processes to which you are predestined… tsk, tsk.
Regis|I've come to take you from this place, my friend. Daresay you deserve a speck of respite after the mad whirl of the last few days.
Geralt|Not the time to give into weakness. You're the commander of her guard, oughta set an example for others. Be dignified, standing guard over her grave. It's what Anna Henrietta would've wanted.
Damien|You are right, Geralt, there will be a time to grieve later. My duty to the ducal seat, that comes first now.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|All in all, best part of the whole ceremony? It was short.
Regis|Perhaps for you, as you ducked out early. The others are probably just getting started. The drunkenness never ends in this quaint realm…
Geralt|Not so fond of Toussaint after all, are we?
Regis|Ah, this place is like a strong wine, Geralt. Good in small sips.
Regis|*Sniff sniff* Mmm, supreme bouquet. Firm, defined beginning, then develops gently, rising to a startling finish. Don't you think?
Geralt|Not much of a connoisseur.
Regis|Then it is high time you started your education. After all, the Corvo Bianco Vineyard is now yours. By the way, I left a gift for you at your new home. On the nightstand.
Geralt|Hm. Thanks. Mind telling me what it is?
Regis|A trifle. That will nonetheless be useful should you need mutagens.
Regis|Incidentally, have you thought about what you'll do with your prize? Shall you hang your swords over the mantle and take to pruning vines?
Geralt|Know what? Think I just might. Come on, now, don't laugh. Maybe not today, or tomorrow…
Geralt|But one day I'll wanna see what it's like - to just wake up everyday in my own bed.
Regis|Oh, stop, please. Sounds so sentimental my fangs have begun to hurt. Then what? Will you begin writing your memoirs, like Dandelion?
Regis|I can remember a night, not too far from here, if I'm not mistaken. We hid in a cave while a blizzard raged all about. Does that sound at all familiar?
Geralt|How could it not? We'd just set off to rescue Ciri from Vilgefortz.
Regis|Our encounter with Vilgefortz, that is something I do not remember so fondly. But that first stay in Beauclair, far calmer than this one.
Geralt|Seemed like a land straight out of a fairytale back then. Its sole problem - cellars too small to accommodate all that wine.
Regis|Appearances, Geralt. Appearances, like mamunes and dopplers, deceive. So what did become of Vilgefortz?
Geralt|Killed him. Sure wasn't easy, though.
Geralt|Ahh… I so don't feel like going anywhere. Sit here a while longer?
Regis|So we shall, my friend. We have witnessed - and, in fact, on several occasions incited - many great and weighty events. After all that toil, I believe we deserve a bit of a rest.
Geralt|That we do.
Geralt|What about you, now? Got a plan?
Regis|I do. I must find Dettlaff. Help him. I certainly owe him that much.
Geralt|Vampire friendships… Clear rules, must be nice.
Regis|Do I detect a note of sarcasm?
Geralt|Not at all.
Geralt|What about you? Any idea where you'll go?
Regis|Distance is of the essence. I thought I might venture south.
Geralt|Nilfgaard?
Regis|Why ever not? The Nilfgaardians are a modern society. None there believe in vampires anymore. This fact alone could be very useful to one wishing to remain incognito.
Geralt|Hmm. Interesting point of view.
Geralt|No. Just not the life for me. Sure, might stop by there occasionally, stay the winter, fill up on wine…
Geralt|But I'd rather keep moving. It's not a choice, being a witcher. And once you are one, you're one for life. You can't just step off the Path.
Geralt|Besides, plenty of work left for me in the world. Ghouls aren't gonna kill themselves.
Geralt|Hey, managing a vineyard - wouldn't happen to be something you've always wanted to try, would it?
Regis|Huh. I'm flattered, Geralt, I am. But no, I, too, was not made to saunter about in a robe and slippers.
Regis|Rather droll, isn't it, that each time we meet something harrowing must happen.
Geralt|Ehh… don't really know yet. Might find the life of a hard-working vintner too tempting one day.
Geralt|Or maybe I'll just stick to the Path, go on roaming, staring up at the stars after laying my bedroll at the roadside.
Regis|Ah, roadsides, bedrolls and the sky above. I sense some poetry coming on… which of course brings to mind Dandelion.
Regis|How do you find my personal brew? Not too strong?
Geralt|Just right.
Regis|Credit the local mandrake, of the Alrauna Diavolis variety, for that. The tubers which grow in this area's volcanic soil have an altogether unique flavor profile and display a remarkably uncommon dark-brown tint.
Geralt|Fascinating. All I can say is, this batch turned out excellent.
Regis|Indeed. It might be wise to stockpile some roots for the future. Would you care to accompany me?
Geralt|If you think it's a good idea, let's go. But I think you might be forgetting one thing. Fresh mandrake root of this variety's highly toxic, even to a witcher.
Regis|Not a problem. I never forget matters of safety and hygiene in alchemy. Here, gloves and a mask. Don them and you shall be in no danger.
Geralt|Thanks. Right, then - let's go.
Geralt|You decide to go root picking now? It's dark out.
Regis|Ehh, Geralt… Even were I generously to assume it had simply slipped your mind that I am a vampire and thus need no light to see…
Regis|… I'd never believe you had also forgotten that you, likewise, have absolutely no trouble seeing in the dark. So, shall we?
Geralt|Met a whole rogues' gallery, all interesting folk, in prison… Can't say I'm eager to ever see any of my cellmates again, though.
Regis|Of all the places to wind up behind bars, Toussaint was a good choice. No other ruler I know would change their mind so quickly.
Regis|Especially given it wasn't about just anyone, but the duchess' very own sister…
Regis|As you know, I had little sympathy for Syanna. Nonetheless I very much regret I could not keep her safe. To you, her ultimate fate - does it still bring on the occasional pang of regret?
Geralt|Yep. Still.
Regis|Well then - drink up.
Geralt|Beauclair seems safe now. Though I'm still left wondering - I mean, Dettlaff's alive. Think Anna Henrietta's still in danger?
Regis|No. He had a score to settle with Syanna. By his reckoning he did just that.
Regis|He has no reason to attack anyone else. Or to remain in Beauclair any longer.
Geralt|Sure hope so. Though in his boots, I'd regret having to go. Place is just plain beautiful, dammit.
Geralt|Syanna's dead, Dettlaff's gone, too. Beauclair's free of the Beast…
Regis|… whichever of them it was.
Geralt|Know it's hard, a tender subject, but… wanted to thank you. For helping me with Dettlaff.
Regis|You need not.
Geralt|Hate to pry, but why--
Regis|Did I decide to stand against him? Ahh, I felt rage had consumed him completely. He'd crossed the line beyond which he could no longer control himself.
Regis|He'd have remained the Beast, irrational, unfit to reason with, incapable of experiencing any of the emotions which, for simplicity's sake, we shall call human.
Regis|I do not wish such a life upon anyone. And especially not on a friend.
Geralt|I understand.
Regis|Forgive me, but I doubt you truly do. And it's very difficult to explain. Let's say I felt the solution I chose to be better for all involved… and for Dettlaff himself most of all.
Geralt|Whatever you say about Syanna - you gotta admit, she was unbending.
Regis|That she was. I do admit it. Though in her case it would have been better if she had been a tad more philosophical, pausing from time to time to reflect on the propriety of her actions.
Geralt|True.
Geralt|Always seemed a very complex creature to me. By your very nature. Not one to go in for simple methods like drinking your worries away.
Regis|I fear there are worries for which, quite simply, there is no other medicine.
Geralt|… all those deaths I failed to prevent. Feel pretty awful right about now… Can't help thinking I could've done more.
Geralt|Now Toussaint's left without a ruler. Or more accurately, chaos rules here. Hand in hand with despair. Duchess won over people's hearts. All Beauclair now weeps for her.
Regis|A mass outburst of emotion? Well… it seems her subjects have adopted some of their recent ruler's traits.
Geralt|Why the sarcasm? Thought you liked Anna Henrietta.
Regis|I did. And I do truly rue her passing.
Geralt|Me too.
Regis|Then let us drink.
Geralt|Left some flowers on her grave.
Geralt|Always seemed to me you were a very complicated creature, by nature. Not one to resort to such simple methods like drinking your worries away.
Regis|There exist worries for which there quite simply is no other medicine.
Geralt|As to Her Enlightened Highness, didn't go great. Got the full kaleidoscope of her emotional states, spun through it at an impressive pace, too.
Regis|Am I to understand she didn't throw her arms about you and shower you with thanks for saving her from her murderous sister?
Geralt|Got that right. I don't blame her, though. Luckily, Dandelion was there to smooth things over. Somewhat.
Geralt|Those bruxae…. they called you a traitor.
Regis|Alas… We've a very simple code of honor, we vampires. So simple you might call it trivial. Either one is with us - unconditionally, regardless of the circumstances - or…
Geralt|Won't let it go, will they.
Regis|They will not. Fortunately, we've another rule - an unwritten one, and just as trivial as the first. It is neatly summarized in the saying, "Out of sight, out of mind."
Regis|That is why I must leave Toussaint. For a vastly long time, most like.
Geralt|Yeah, I get it.
Regis|Ah… Let us make for my camp. I've an overwhelming desire to have another drink.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Unexpected as ever.
Geralt|And beautiful as ever.
Yennefer|Won't you even ask why I've come? Or how I found you?
Geralt|Wouldn't get a straight answer anyway.
Yennefer|Quite true.
Geralt|Used to bother me, all your secrets… Now I know if you have something to tell me, you'll tell me. Don't need to ask.
Yennefer|I missed you, Geralt. Madly.
Yennefer|Come outside. We can hold hands and stare at the sky. Like in some shitty two-crown romance.
Geralt|Brought quite a few books… Lemme guess - working on a new spell?
Yennefer|Not at all. These aren't grimoires, just pleasure reading . "The Name of the Orchid," "A Widower for Half a Year."
Geralt|Hmm. Always thought you too busy to make time for something as impractical as pleasure reading.
Yennefer|Because I was. But now, I'm not.
Yennefer|A few weeks ago I awoke to the realization that I know not what to do next. I have no plan, I have no goal.
Yennefer|And you know what? I like that. Finally I can stop thinking about politics and focus on what's important to me.
Yennefer|Which is why I came here.
Geralt|Liking Toussaint so far?
Yennefer|Hmm… The landscape's lovely and the towns are charming, no question about that…
Geralt|But…
Yennefer|But the southern sun plays havoc with my wardrobe. To be blunt, wear black down here and you're pretty damn hot.
Geralt|Hmm… Might need to think about changing your color palette. Off white and pea-green, for instance?
Yennefer|Mhm. And I'll wear scents distilled from turnips and daisies.
Yennefer|I think I shall simply stay in the shade. And you'll bring me cool drinks. At regular intervals.
Geralt|Bring you whatever you want.
Geralt|You know, feels kinda strange having a home.
Yennefer|Mhm. I must say I never pictured you owning real estate.
Geralt|Was something of an accident… but I'm not about to complain.
Geralt|Yen… Back then, before we fought the Hunt… Said you wanted to run away with me, to the world's end. This vineyard… good enough?
Yennefer|Hmm… Yes, although… there's one thing missing…
Geralt|Namely?
Yennefer|I shall give you a hint. It's large, white… has four legs… Category - taxidermy.
Geralt|Oh yeah. The unicorn.
Geralt|Fine. You can bring it down here.
Yennefer|I knew you'd see things my way.
Geralt|Every thought this day would come? Me and you… Peace and quiet… bees buzzing, birds chirping…?
Yennefer|I almost regret delaying so long before coming to you… I was quite the silly goose…
Geralt|You have doubts? Though I imagine it might've been hard, coming after me. Always were proud as a peacock.
Yennefer|Please, Geralt. I'm not like other sorceresses to feel that following someone means my wings have been clipped.
Geralt|Ooh, watch what you say about your colleagues - remember, it's an ill bird that fouls its own nest.
Yennefer|Well said, witcher. You're not only handsome, but wise, too… I feel a bit like the cat that got the canary.
Geralt|Yeah, and I'm… Hmm. Dammit. You win. This time.
Yennefer|Hah!
Geralt|How'd that start, anyway? Our duels in wordplay?
Yennefer|Forgotten? It was at a vernissage in Ban Ard. You started it to keep from going mad with boredom. I remember finding your sense of humor both groan-worthy… and somehow endearing.
Yennefer|Never change, Geralt. I beg you.
Geralt|So… talk again later?
Yennefer|Of course. I'm not going anywhere.
Geralt|Can we talk?
Yennefer|Always. With pleasure.
<|endoftext|>
Triss|Yes, Geralt…?
Geralt|How are things in Kovir?
Triss|Amazingly boring and predictable. Council meetings mainly concern trade matters. Tariffs, storage regulations, that sort of thing.
Geralt|Missing the excitement?
Triss|You know the Ofieri saying… "May you live in interesting times." Well, I've already done that and now am looking for a bit of quiet.
Triss|The other mages I brought with me from Novigrad or who made it north on their own feel the same. You wouldn't recognize them - no conspiracies, cabals, plotting… They just sit there and work. For the good of the kingdom.
Triss|Sometimes I think it's all too lovely to be true… That something's bound to happen, another war or some other horror.
Triss|But for now… it's nice. And once you finish your business here and come join me, it'll be even better.
Geralt|So, how do you like my vineyard?
Triss|Think you know the answer to that… I like it a lot. House is big, but not showy, lovely location… perfect for romantic getaways.
Geralt|Planning to do a bit of renovation. Paint the walls, replace the roof tiles, install tin gutters…
Triss|Have you thought about the garden? Will you leave it as is, or change it?
Geralt|Hmm… maybe a hedge maze? With a statue in the center, one that's stately and… nude.
Triss|Ugh, Geralt, don't bring up that ball… The wine got to my head and I…
Geralt|Not bringing it up to tease, but to reminisce. That evening… it was magic. And your dress… you looked lovely in it.
Triss|I've got it with me… I could put it on one evening. We'll dine outside, by candlelight, listen to the music of the cicadas… Hm?
Geralt|Can't wait.
Geralt|There are already some new saplings and flowers around the grounds, but… I think it's still missing something.
Geralt|Just finished some remodeling. Paid through the nose for it, but I think it was worth it…
Geralt|How'd you find me? Kovir's a long way off…
Triss|I have my ways, Geralt. Hydromancy, for example.
Geralt|Oh yeah, that's right…
Geralt|So what becomes of us? See anything else in the reflection?
Triss|Mhm. Zoltan moves in.
Geralt|Please, tell me you're joking.
Triss|You can breathe easy. Far as I know, he's settled down in Novigrad and has no intention of budging.
Triss|In all seriousness, though… I did see a few scraps of our future, but… I'd rather not tell you exactly what.
Geralt|Why not?
Triss|Because you said you've grown to like pleasant surprises.
Geralt|This is your first time in Toussaint, right? Want me to show you around a bit?
Triss|Sorry, but I've already made plans…
Geralt|Oh? What're you going to do?
Triss|Lie down in the sun. And not move an inch.
Geralt|Ooh, right, a packed schedule… Not overdoing it a tad?
Triss|Got to get the most of this weather before I return north… Know that joke about how to tell when summer's come to Kovir?
Geralt|The rain isn't quite so cold.
Triss|And sadly, that's not far from the truth…
Triss|Ehh, I shouldn't have told you that. Now you'll change your mind and not come join me.
Geralt|Wouldn't worry about that.
Geralt|Mind if I leave you here alone for a moment?
Triss|Just a moment.
Geralt|Triss?
Triss|In the flesh.
Geralt|I… I thought you were in Kovir?
Triss|I got tired of waiting for you, so I decided to head to Toussaint. Catch some sun, see how things are going. You said it would only take a moment…
Geralt|Things are pretty much wrapped up, luckily. We'll be able to head north soon.
Triss|I hope you're not upset I came like this, without warning…
Geralt|True, I haven't always been fond of surprises. They remind me of work: the Law of Surprise, Surprise Child…
Geralt|But I think I've changed my mind. Seems surprises can actually be pleasant. Very pleasant.
Geralt|Let's go outside. There's this one cozy spot you're gonna love.
<|endoftext|>
Cirilla|You look good.
Cirilla|Come, don't just stand there. I want a hug.
Geralt|Thought I'd… I'd never see you again.
Cirilla|Well, I've departed, escaped, been forced to flee so many times… yet I always returned. You ought to be used ot it by now.
Cirilla|I like coming back into your life.
Geralt|I'm just glad you're here.
Cirilla|The house is lovely… It just needs some work.
Geralt|Yeah… plan to do a lot. Wanna go outside, maybe? Could show you the grounds.
Cirilla|Aahh, it's lovely here! I could stay forever…
Geralt|Anything stopping you?
Cirilla|Obligations, duties. I'm only here because papa, I mean, Emhyr, concluded I must get to know what I'll rule once I take the throne. So I'm on a tour of the provinces with a small swarm of advisors.
Cirilla|Which essentially means they take turns lecturing me while I follow them about, scribbling notes.
Geralt|Plan to stay in Beauclair a while?
Cirilla|A bit. I convinced my advisors we'd be unwise to depart before I'd tasted each of this year's wines. My knowledge would be incomplete, you see.
Cirilla|Though actually, just between you and me, I'm not certain I'm cut out to rule, govern, all that…
Geralt|Thinking you might give it up?
Cirilla|I can't say just yet. But I'm not willing to rule it out.
Geralt|How fares your venerable father?
Cirilla|He seems younger, quite rejuvenated. Abandoning high-level politics seems to have done it. It's as if the very awareness of peace grants him strength. Which most likely is the case.
Geralt|Think he'll keep his word?
Cirilla|I think that depends on me. If he feels I'm up to the task, he'll head out to pasture, yes…
Geralt|And if he doesn't?
Cirilla|Then there'll be nothing to stop him from returning. He hasn't ever had a problem changing his mind.
Geralt|Preparations for the coronation coming along?
Cirilla|Not at all. I told him I'm in no hurry. I must see what the whole thing's about, first, acquaint myself with the empire's institutions, laws, and so forth.
Geralt|No pressure from Emhyr to speed things along?
Cirilla|He tried, but I told him I wished to be a good ruler, a strong ruler, not some puppet.
Geralt|No one else in the world he'd give in to like that.
Cirilla|I had nothing to do with that. There's just no one else in the world who's his daughter.
Cirilla|Speaking o which, as the future empress, I could secure you a comfortable position as court witcher…
Geralt|Thanks, but.. just not my thing, that. My place is on the Path.
Cirilla|Hehe. I know. Still had to try.
Geralt|See you later, Ciri.
Cirilla|Take care of yourself.
Geralt|Nah, come on. You wouldn't like it…
Cirilla|Why not?
Geralt|Be bored to death. No orders to sign, no subjects to sentence to torture and death…
Cirilla|I intend to do no such thing, ever. And I don't set my name to any orders just yet. I'm being groomed - Emhyr's idea. So he sent me and a flock of advisors off on a tour of the provinces.
Cirilla|You've a lovely home. With a great deal of potential.
Geralt|Got it from the duchess as her down payment for killing the Beast. Even started to renovate a bit… Come outside, lemme show you the grounds.
Cirilla|You've fixed the place up nicely.
Geralt|Thanks. Got the house from the duchess as a down payment for killing the Beast. Come outside, lemme show you the grounds.
Geralt|What's stopping you?
Cirilla|Actually… not a thing! I slew a garkain, collected my bounty. I believe I'm owed some respite.
Geralt|Indeed you do, mademoiselle, as my majordomo would say.
Cirilla|You've a butler?
Geralt|A steward. Name's Barnabas-Basil - B.B. for short, though I don't know if he likes it. He's the one let you in. I'll ask him to bring in some fruit, a beverage. You can spend the rest of the day lying about.
Cirilla|Nothing would make me happier.
Geralt|Being a witcher anything like you imagined?
Cirilla|Geralt, I didn't have to imagine anything… Remember, before we parted we walked a good stretch of the Path together…
Geralt|Journeyman and master, though, not the same thing.
Cirilla|I'm still a long way from mastering anything. But I am trying. Anyway, I did learn from the best.
Geralt|Just passed on what worked for me. Or at least tried to.
Cirilla|I was thinking of Eskel and Lambert… Mhmhmhmhmhm….
Geralt|So, no regrets? Choice you made?
Cirilla|Not at all. I'm doing what I ever wanted to do, being who I wanted to be. I believe that's one definition of happiness.
Geralt|Encountered the most charming aspect of being a witcher yet?
Cirilla|Which aspect is that?
Geralt|The hatred, disgust. That strange blend of admiration, fear and contempt.
Cirilla|Hm. They set their hounds on me in one village. In another, they forbade me from taking a drink from their well. Other than that, it's been all right. No one's tried to cheat me out of my reward so far.
Geralt|I'd hoped they'd treat a woman differently.
Cirilla|Geralt… When they treat a woman differently in this world it hardly ever means better. Quite the opposite.
Geralt|Angren - how'd it go? Garkains can be pretty tough opponents…
Cirilla|That's why I had to lure this one to a place both spacious and empty, where it would have nowhere to hide. I found an abandoned crypt far from any town or village.
Geralt|Good choice. Always best to avoid additional casualties. So your foe had nowhere to hide, but the bastard was still damn quick, I bet.
Cirilla|Not as quick as I am. My greater worry was its strength, I was far out-classed there. But a dose of Black Blood did the trick. We fought a while, I feigned a mistimed dodge and let it drink. The rest was easy.
Geralt|*Sniff* What's that smell?
Cirilla|You look good.
Cirilla|Come, don't just stand there. I want a hug.
Geralt|What'd you bring…?
Cirilla|A garkain from Angren. I slew it. All by my lonesome.
Geralt|That why you left Carreras so suddenly… ? Had no idea where you'd gone. You note was… puzzling - "Don't try to find me." Threw me for a loop.
Cirilla|That was silly. It's just that I felt… stifled, in your shadow, I'd have suffocated had I stayed.
Cirilla|So when I read that notice, the contract… when I saw Angren, I knew I had to do it. Alone. Without my nanny.
Geralt|I'm not your nanny. I believe in you.
Geralt|Like my new house?
Cirilla|The house is lovely… but it could use a bit of work.
Geralt|Yeah… got plans for it, don't worry. Wanna go outside? Could show you the grounds.
Cirilla|Aahh, it's lovely here! I could stay forever…
Geralt|Nah, come on. You wouldn't like it…
Cirilla|Why not?
Geralt|Get bored mighty quick. There's nothing here. It's peaceful, quiet, not a bloodthirsty beast in sight…
Cirilla|After that garkain in Angren, I believe I deserve a little rest.
Cirilla|It's a lovely home. Has a great deal of potential.
Geralt|Got it from the duchess as a down payment for killing the Beast. Already managed to renovate a bit… Come outside, I'll show you the grounds.
Cirilla|You've fixed it up nicely.
Geralt|Thanks. Got the house from the duchess as a down payment for killing the beast. Come outside, I'll show you the grounds.
Geralt|See you've taken a liking to this place…
Cirilla|Ehh, I could stay right here forever.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Dandelion? What the hell're you doing here?
Dandelion|I'm not here. I'm a figment of your imagination, 'cause you really want me to be here.
Dandelion|Brought you a housewarming gift. It's also an illusion. How do you like it?
Dandelion|Good. So, some important business. If anyone asks, I'm not here. Last time I was in Toussaint, enjoying myself, admittedly, Anarietta…
Geralt|Dandelion…
Dandelion|That is, the duchess…
Geralt|Dandelion.
Dandelion|Got a bit carried away and banished me on pain of death. I wouldn't want…
Geralt|Dandelion. Anna Henrietta… she's dead.
Dandelion|What…? But… how?
Geralt|Mhhh, c'mon. Got a story to tell you for a change…
Geralt|Sadly, I couldn't stop Syanna. She killed her own sister. Just one small consolation - Syanna's dead, too.
Dandelion|Is that so…? Gods… what a terrible, terrible loss. She was the morning sun striking dew, a vibrant butterfly among dun moths…
Dandelion|Should've ridden down here with you. Might've done something together to avert this. But I had my hands full back home.
Geralt|How are you, old friend?
Dandelion|Not well, unfortunately. After you left Novigrad, this one day, Priscilla was attacked. In the street.
Dandelion|She was wounded badly, took a long time to recover. Luckily, she's better now.
Geralt|What are you talking about? Who the hell attacked her?
Dandelion|Still looking for the bastard who hurt her. Once I find him, he'll regret what he did, regret the day he was born.
Geralt|Sorry, Dandelion. Sorry I wasn't around.
Dandelion|Got your own problems, your own priorities. Can't expect you to be at my side whenever anything goes wrong. Besides, it's Priscilla, so I need to handle this.
Geralt|What's new, old friend?
Dandelion|Everything's coming up Dandelion. Priscilla's much better and our relationship's a budding flower blossoming in the spring sun.
Geralt|You two still together?
Dandelion|Don't act so surprised! The woman was made for me. As I was for her. She told me so.
Geralt|Know how many times I've heard that some woman was made for you?
Dandelion|Ehh, love's blunders… Who's never made one? I hadn't met Priscilla yet. Now I know she's my heart's captor. You know, think we might get married.
Geralt|Congratulations.
Geralt|What's new, old friend?
Dandelion|Everything's fine, great. Thanks to you, I'm with a woman I'm entirely devoted to, surrendered my heart to.
Geralt|Didn't have all that much to do with that.
Dandelion|If you hadn't been there, Priscilla would've died a cruel death. And right about now I'd be drowning my sorrows in some dive with piss-stained walls.
Geralt|Hope she's better.
Dandelion|She had the best medics around. Wounds've all healed. She's confident, outgoing, she's got places to go and folk to see. And in the alcove…? I mean, can you imagine she--
Geralt|Dandelion, I can't imagine, and I won't…
Dandelion|All right, but… your loss.
Geralt|How's business? You and Zoltan still have your tavern? Or has he embarked on some new venture?
Dandelion|You know him. We'll share a jug of mead and he'll go on about some new plan he's got. Nothing ever comes of it. So, we're still there.
Dandelion|Recently, we discovered Novigrad's largest wine importer was a lying cheat.
Dandelion|Watering down his wines. But so clever you'd never taste the difference.
Geralt|So how'd you figure out he was up to something?
Dandelion|This one day I was feeling down in the muck. Decided to lift my spirits by… well, getting a little drunk. Actually, replace "a little" with "really."
Dandelion|So I knocked back a bottle - nothing. Then another - maybe a slight buzz.
Geralt|Might not be a lightweight anymore. Could be those years of training have finally paid off.
Dandelion|Come on! It took me five bottles to start seeing double.
Dandelion|I thought, huh, might just be a weird day. So I tried the same thing the next morning. Exact same result.
Dandelion|I told Zoltan. He tried it, and confirmed my findings. So we decided to ask the importer some tough questions. The man cracked.
Dandelion|I threatened to tell everyone about his trickery unless he gave me a discount.
Geralt|Plan to kick around Beauclair long?
Dandelion|I rode here with the specific intention of staying a while. Priscilla voiced no objections. But since my Anarietta, that is, the duchess, is gone, there's no point.
Dandelion|She meant too much to me. Can't possibly walk these streets now, knowing I'll never see her again…
Geralt|Plan to stay long?
Dandelion|Don't know yet, but… might stay a little while. I've always loved Beauclair. The place is made for poets.
Geralt|What'll you do here?
Dandelion|City's full of knights-errant, and they all want ballads immortalizing their deeds.
Dandelion|Get this - I've already been approached by a knight who's spent years battling the weather. Says he's got a real bone to pick with gusty storms.
Geralt|Battles the weather? How's that work?
Dandelion|Don't know. Promised to show me when the time was right. There's another who's vowed to move a mountain that's blocking his ailing mother's view of the sunset.
Dandelion|So he's moving it. One stone at a time. Sole worry is that his mama won't live to see him finish.
Geralt|Hmm… You're right, prime ballad material there… Glad you came. We'll have some good talks.
Geralt|See you later, Dandelion.
Dandelion|See you, witcher.
Dandelion|Good. So Geralt, important to remember - if anyone asks, I'm not here.
Dandelion|Last time I was in Toussaint, enjoying myself, true, Anarietta, that is, the duchess, got a little carried away. Banished me from the duchy on pain of death. Wouldn't want to ruffle her feathers without cause.
Geralt|Wise. Especially since she's been through quite a bit recently.
Dandelion|I've heard some rumors, but I'd love a first-hand account. Does it have the makings of a ballad?
Geralt|… Luckily, Syanna made up with Anarietta, seems to have abandoned her plans. She's locked up now, awaiting sentencing, really. Most think the duchess'll forgive her. Might take some time, but…
Dandelion|What a story! Seems I missed quite a lot! Huh, shame I didn't ride here with you. Though truth be told, had my hands full back home as well.
Dandelion|Now for some serious business. If anyone asks, I'm not here. Last time I was in Beauclair, admittedly enjoying myself, Anarietta…
Dandelion|Now for some serious business. If anyone asks, I'm not here.
Dandelion|Last time I was in Beauclair, admittedly enjoying myself, my Anarietta, that is, the duchess, got a bit carried away and banished me on pain of death. Wouldn't want to ruffle her feathers again.
Geralt|Moving in…?
Dandelion|Me? Hah, hardly! Brought you a little something. A housewarming gift. How do you like it?
Dandelion|Good. Well, now we've dispensed with all the formalities, I want you tell me all about what happened here.
Geralt|You oughta know. Got me out of prison, didn't you?
Dandelion|But I want to hear your side, first-hand. And I'll be honest - intend to use every last bit in a new ballad.
Geralt|… Sadly, I wasn't able to save Syanna. Dettlaff showed her no mercy, no understanding… and you know the rest.
Dandelion|What a tale…! Feel sorriest for Anarietta, poor thing. Oo… I should've come here with you. Might've pulled off some miracle together. Though, truth be told, I had my hands full back home.
Dandelion|Geralt! Here at last!
Geralt|Makes you look dignified… and manlier than in real life.
Dandelion|Does it? The painter's a friend of mine. Could be she gave me slightly broader shoulders… Meant well, I'm sure.
Geralt|Don't doubt it. But didn't I see this painting at your place?
Dandelion|This is its perfect replica. And it's yours… to remember me by.
Geralt|You shouldn't have. Really. Not everyone likes seeing you first thing every morning.
Dandelion|Come on, don't be dramatic - this is the guest room. If you ask me, it belongs here, fits this space like a warm glove.
Dandelion|Well? Going to show me around, tell me the story?
Geralt|Course. Let's go.
Dandelion|Right, now we've dispensed with the formalities, why don't you fill me in. What's been going on here?
Geralt|Dandelion, got a minute?
Dandelion|For you, my friend, always.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|So long.
Geralt|What do you do here? Hunt Scoia'tael?
Roche|You jest, right? Who cares about the Scoia'tael anymore.
Roche|Temeria – that's what matters.
Geralt|How'd you wind up here?
Roche|Came with the army, of course. Its remnants.
Roche|When Nilfgaard crossed the Yaruga, I dropped everything, threw it all away to hell and rode for the front to fight the invader. Joined the 2nd Temerian Army under John Natalis. We were to stop the Black Ones' advance along the Dol Blathanna - Mount Carbon line.
Roche|And we did. For three days. Then they smashed us into splinters.
Roche|Soon after, I heard Radovid was assembling his forces near Novigrad. That he'd promised to fight for a free North. Broke through with the remains of Natalis' army, but…
Geralt|But?
Roche|But Radovid proved no better than Emhyr. So I decided I would mount my own fight.
Roche|Geralt of Rivia. Safe and sound.
Geralt|Vernon Roche. Temeria's last hope.
Roche|Laugh all you want. Temeria will rise again.
Ves|Roche, I cannot abandon them. I--
Roche|You can and must. Because those are your orders.
Ves|They'll die. Please.
Roche|We're done. Dismissed.

Geralt|[DEBUG] Did I meet the Baron's men in the Inn at the Crossroads while looking for Hendrik?
Geralt|[DEBUG] [DEBUG] Did I insult someone during q101 (looking for Hendrik)? [DEBUG]
Geralt|Was q103 (finding Baron's family) the last quest I completed, and thus I have already seen Uma?

Shani|Yes, Geralt?
Geralt|Gotta say, wedding was a great idea. Rarely have a chance to rest, get away from it all. Did me good to do just that.
Shani|I'm a medic. I tend to know what I'm doing when I prescribe something.
Geralt|Hope Vlodimir's antics weren't too annoying.
Shani|A… peculiar man, ghost - true. But I found him… likeable. Wager he was a real hoot when he was alive.
Geralt|Should do it again some time. Except, with no ghost possessing my body.
Shani|I'd be glad to.
Geralt|Said you needed to think things over. Have you?
Shani|Yes. I decided you're incredibly sweet, but--
Geralt|But we're better off keeping things as they were?
Shani|Mhm. You're always going places, and they're likely to ship me off soon…
Geralt|You're right… but… promise to share a bottle of wine with me from time to time?
Shani|Of course! Tell you what - I'll keep one handy.
Shani|Ah, besides, we tried once… and you know how that worked out.
Geralt|You know, been wanting to ask you something…
Shani|Ask me now.
Geralt|Just… curious. You ever play gwent?
Shani|Oh, Geralt, Geralt… Of course I play. What else is there to do come evening when one's among soldiers?
Shani|Come on, let's lay them out.
Geralt|Care for a round of gwent?
Shani|I should think so!
Geralt|Came by after I… escaped from Ofieri ship. Must've just missed you.
Shani|My commanders summoned me. Interrogated me about the sewers, what happened there.
Geralt|Interrogated?
Shani|Had some questions. I went down there with a whole unit. Only I came out alive, they wanted to know why.
Geralt|What'd you say?
Shani|What could I say? Sewers're are swarming with drowners, soldiers died as heroes protecting me. All of which is true.
Shani|Captain sent me off to test the samples I'd collected, then ordered the sewers locked down.
Geralt|That's good, at least.
Geralt|Finally, some time to talk. Tell me where you've been, what you've done - since you left Vizima.
Shani|You mean after you left Vizima with Triss? Hmm…
Shani|Well, the peace was brief, but I used it well. Went back to Oxenfurt, completed my doctorate. Then I believe I did time in every field hospital and medic's tent north of the Yaruga.
Geralt|Never could stand to be idle.
Shani|I'm not a witcher, not likely to live a hundred and fifty years. My time's much shorter, so I try to use every bit wisely.
Geralt|Always did know what you wanted.
Shani|True. Nothing's changed in that sense.
Shani|After… our paths diverged? Hmm…
Geralt|See you later.
Shani|You're good. So good I'd say you spend more time chatting up folk for games, than you do on serious matters.
Geralt|Naaa, got lucky, that's all.
Shani|Mhm, likely. But here - an, I daresay, formidable card from an old friend… so you won't have to rely entirely on luck.
Shani|You lost. My, you actually stink at this. Worse than an enema tube, in fact..
Geralt|Need to demand satisfaction for that insult. We'll have to play again.

Toussaint Blacksmith 01|Well, well… Starling Straggen of house Bum-Diddled Harlotsbrood has bit the dust. May he rest in pain and agony!
Toussaint Blacksmith 01|You've earned yourself a steep price cut here, witcher.
Geralt|Show me what you have on offer, will you?
Geralt|Need something crafted. Could you do that?
Geralt|Straggen - name's familiar. Ran into him a while back.
Toussaint Blacksmith 01|What's this?! He must have been a horrible houndshagger. Decent folk don't bear that name.
Geralt|Can't say if that's true for all the Straggens, but this one sure wasn't decent. Met a bad end, too. Justly so.
Toussaint Blacksmith 01|You carved up the knobcupper! I knew it!
Geralt|Druids did it for me, actually. Burned him alive.
Toussaint Blacksmith 01|Oh, lovely, lovely!
Geralt|Mind taking a glance at these diagrams?
Toussaint Blacksmith 01|For you, witcher, I will take two!
Toussaint Blacksmith 01|I regret to say only a grandmaster could decipher these scribblings. And a grandmaster I am not…
Geralt|See you later.
Toussaint Blacksmith 01|Ha, the witcher we love to love! I hope you've gutted some particularly nasty nastiness since last we met… Ah, what am I saying - of course you have.
Toussaint Blacksmith 01|Witcher! A moment of your time, may I?

Nilfgaardian Inkeeper|Ard Feainn! Just what we needed… a witcher with stones of granite!
Nilfgaardian Inkeeper|That… bloede hanse had terrorized this land too long. Thank you for your aid, vatt'ghern.
Geralt|Show me what you're peddling, Nilfgaardian.
Geralt|A Nilfgaardian a long way from home… and he's not a soldier. Don't see that often.
Nilfgaardian Inkeeper|Warfare did not appeal to me. My vathair, however - meaning, my father…
Nilfgaardian Inkeeper|He fought at Sodden Hill. Survived despite a lung run through with a spear and a right hand that went missing.
Nilfgaardian Inkeeper|Yet the injuries meant he could no longer serve in the Impera Brigade. Here in Toussaint, the clime and wine bolster healing. And a war pension paid in Nilfgaardian florens buys much… An inn, for instance.
Nilfgaardian Inkeeper|I thank you, witcher, for your aid, for recovering my patrimony. Ard dank!
Geralt|So long.
Nilfgaardian Inkeeper|Witcher! Greetings!
Nilfgaardian Inkeeper|Witcher! Witcher! A word, might I have?
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Trader 11|My soul cannot handle this… it simply cannot. Oh, Lebioda's wounds!
Geralt|Calm down. It's over.
Toussaint Trader 11|I thank you, sir. And you must forgive me my momentary loss of composure. Are you in need of accoutrements, monsieur?
Geralt|What do you have that you're willing to sell?
Geralt|Villa looks abandoned. You its owner?
Toussaint Trader 11|More its temporary steward. By order of the treasury minister, I am to serve as caretaker of Count de Launay's properties and estates. The count is missing.
Toussaint Trader 11|Yet no one at the palace warned me Villa Vedette is the lair of bandits! That is to say, it was but is no more - thanks to your heroism, monsieur witcher!
Geralt|Looking for scrolls, manuscripts. Bearing diagrams of witcher gear, specifically. Any chance you've happened on any?
Toussaint Trader 11|I've not yet managed to inventory the sundries. I arrived just a short while ago. The bandits arrived with their terror…
Toussaint Trader 11|But you may ferret about if you so wish.
Geralt|Thanks. So long.
Toussaint Trader 11|Hail, sir! Do you require anything?
Toussaint Trader 11|What a nightmare! What a horror! Grotesque and macabre!

Toussaint Armourer 02|I owe you my life, unknown knight. How are you dubbed?
Geralt|Dubbed Geralt. Geralt of Rivia.
Toussaint Armourer 02|My thanks, Sir Geralt! The scallywags sought to demolish our herb garden, you see! I thought, I shall take a hammer, scare the rabble off, but…
Toussaint Armourer 02|To my great chagrin, there were too many and I, I failed!
Toussaint Armourer 02|Ehh, there's no use crying over spilt wine. Come with me to Vermentino, I'll patch up your armor or pound the anvil to fulfill some other need you might have.
Geralt|Fine, lead the way.
Geralt|Go ahead. I'll stop by when I'm in the area.
Geralt|All right. What do you have?
Geralt|Craft something for me, can you?
Geralt|Vineyard 's glory days seem like a thing of the past…
Toussaint Armourer 02|It's seen better times, true. For bandits are not our only problem. Enormous yellow parasites, their ever-growing plague, we also must contend with.
Toussaint Armourer 02|Maid Matilda tries her best, but when folk fear to go out and work, what is she to do?
Geralt|Thanks, see you later.
Toussaint Armourer 02|I thank you again for your aid! Till we meet at Vermentino.
Toussaint Armourer 02|Here we are. Is there some way I might help you?
Toussaint Armourer 02|Greetings, Geralt!
Toussaint Armourer 02|I shall tell you this much… when first I heard Maid Matilda had forged a partnership with the ever slippery Liam, well, I near popped a cork!
Toussaint Armourer 02|But once it was revealed the dingledong had not, in fact, been responsible for our woes, I thought to myself…
Toussaint Armourer 02|I suppose it's about time Maid Matilda found a mister, is it not?
Toussaint Armourer 02|Help! Save me!

Toussaint Herbalist Woman 01|Welcome, wanderer. In need of herbs, perhaps? Wort for a sore stomach or…
Geralt|Prefer willow bark or iris root for stomach aches. Wort can cause dizziness, nausea.
Toussaint Herbalist Woman 01|Forgive me. It's just that you do not have the look of one familiar with herbs.
Geralt|What look's that? And looks deceive, anyway. Me, I'm not out for common weeds that grow in any meadow. Need rare ingredients. Can you help me out? Or should I move on?
Toussaint Herbalist Woman 01|You must judge for yourself.
Geralt|Right, show me what you got?
Geralt|Wouldn't happen to play gwent, would you?
Geralt|Meant no offense.
Toussaint Herbalist Woman 01|And I took none. I should be the one to apologize - for judging by appearance alone. Tell me - your knowledge, how did you gain it? From an herbalist living nearby?
Geralt|No. From somewhere a long way off. Kaer Morhen. Northern Kaedwen.
Toussaint Herbalist Woman 01|Gods… That's the continent's other end! What are you doing in Toussaint?
Geralt|Same thing I do anywhere. Killing monsters.
Geralt|I'm off. See you later.
Toussaint Herbalist Woman 01|Lo and behold, my herb aficionado. Here to buy?
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Trader 02|My savior, my spider smasher! How might I be of service?
Geralt|Was looking to buy something… maybe sell something, too.
Geralt|Wine trade - been at it for a while?
Toussaint Trader 02|Not terribly long, to be candid. I apprenticed to be an alchemist, but proportions were never my strong suit. So I took to trading in wines. More pleasant, I must say - one drinks on the job and no one ever complains.
Geralt|Makes sense. And the world's always a bit more bearable on a buzz.
Geralt|Time I got back on the Path. So long.
Geralt|Arachnomorphs don't look much like bunnies, but they sure breed like them. Best nip the problem in the bud. I'll look into it.
Geralt|First things first. Need to talk about my reward.
Geralt|Need to think about it. Sorry, got a pretty full plate.
Geralt|Heard you calling. Wanted to talk?
Toussaint Trader 02|I did! For we're neck-deep in trouble! Of the spider kind!
Geralt|Need a maid with a broom, not a witcher.
Toussaint Trader 02|You fail to understand! These are huge - the size of pigs or dogs. Black and hairy, spewing webs!
Geralt|Mhh. Not talking about spiders, then. Talking about arachnomorphs.
Toussaint Trader 02|Call them what you will! You must smash the rogues, will you? Those caves would be prime barrel storage were it not for the beasts…
Geralt|All taken care of. Went inside and cleaned up.
Toussaint Trader 02|Thank the gods! And you too, of course!
Toussaint Trader 02|Will you help? Or not?
Toussaint Trader 02|Any tidings?
Geralt|None yet. Rest assured, though. It'll all work out.
Toussaint Trader 02|Hey! Over here, please!
Toussaint Trader 02|Err, not an amount I can afford. Perhaps a modest reduction, eh?
Toussaint Trader 02|Not far now. We find ourselves a hair from agreeing.
Toussaint Trader 02|I knew we would agree terms!
Toussaint Trader 02|No, no, no! You exaggerate. Take what I offer or I'll find another for the job!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Trader 03|The witcher! My savior!
Geralt|Show me what you're peddling.
Geralt|Was wondering… previous owners - what'd they use the warehouse for? Why was it full of carrion?
Toussaint Trader 03|It was Godfried Nork's before it was mine. Yes, that Nork - Toussaint's most famed charcutier.
Toussaint Trader 03|That is, until his saucisse a la moutarde poisoned half the court of Her Illustrious Highness the Duquessa.
Geralt|Take it he fell out of favor?
Toussaint Trader 03|Favor's not the word. He was cast in prison, all his property confiscated and auctioned off.
Geralt|So long.
Toussaint Trader 03|Lebioda wept, it is positively reesty.
Toussaint Trader 03|Pardon me. Perhaps… perhaps you could help me? You seem a strapping lad.
Geralt|What's the problem?
Toussaint Trader 03|I acquired this old storehouse at auction. As it turns out, it stinks like an Ofieri larder and is loud as a Novigrad brothel!
Toussaint Trader 03|Bumbotch it all, I invested my life's savings! Now I fear to go inside! Do help me, witcher.
Geralt|All right. I'll take a look inside your storehouse.
Geralt|Could look into it, maybe… Long as you have the means to pay me.
Geralt|Sorry. No time just now.
Geralt|Storehouse was full of rotten meat. Attracted ghouls I had to get rid of.
Toussaint Trader 03|Saint Lebioda's calloused heels! But is it safe now? Completely?
Geralt|Mhm. Though I'd advise you to clean the meat out quick. Before other ghouls show up.
Toussaint Trader 03|Of course! Yes! I shall put my men to it toot sweet.
Toussaint Trader 03|Meanwhile, perhaps you need something? I've a meager stock just now, but come back in two days to see a full array. At a discount that will make you cross-eyed.
Toussaint Trader 03|Oh, the stench - absolutely rancid! Witcher! Help!
Toussaint Trader 03|Well? Have you seen to my storehouse?
Geralt|Relax, I'll get to it.
Toussaint Trader 03|And? And? Is the storehouse safe?
Toussaint Trader 03|No. I fear not. That is not an expense I can accommodate.
Toussaint Trader 03|Have mercy, man, the store itself has already cost me a fortune. Drop your fee a bit more, please?
Toussaint Trader 03|Fine, so be it. We've a deal.
Toussaint Trader 03|Sorry, simply not affordable to me.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Trader 01|Ah, witcher! Welcome back!
Geralt|Maybe we could do some trading?
Geralt|Leg better?
Toussaint Trader 01|It's healing nicely… but there will be a scar.
Geralt|Good. Something to impress the ladies with.
Toussaint Trader 01|I prefer to impress them with my charm, intellect and manners.
Geralt|Yeah. Good luck with that.
Geralt|I'm off. See you later.
Toussaint Trader 01|So? Will you see what's amiss in my storehouse?
Geralt|I will, soon enough. Patience.
Geralt|Done that already. Ran into a few giant centipedes.
Toussaint Trader 01|Ah-ha… and how am I to prevent them from crawling back in?
Geralt|Don't know. I kill monsters, don't predict the future.
Toussaint Trader 01|You needn't be cross, witcher. You shall get a good price on all my goods - in gratitude. Come back in two days' time. You will see the fine storehouse I've made!
Geralt|Wound doesn't look good. Patch that up quick if I were you, before it starts festering.
Toussaint Trader 01|If I needed medical advice, I'd have called for a healer. And you look like nonesuch, not even a quack.
Geralt|Mhm. And if you wanted a witcher to help you, you should've thought twice about being rude.
Toussaint Trader 01|Forgive me… The pain's so blasted bad, it's darkened my mood… A foulness has made its lair in the grotto. I barely escaped with my life. I've been eyeing the cave for a storehouse quite some time. Would you look inside?
Geralt|See what I can do. Wait here… and you need to clean that wound, trust me.
Geralt|Guess I could have a look… Not for free, though.
Geralt|Maybe later. Got more urgent matters in mind right now.
Toussaint Trader 01|Have you time now? Will you help with the beasts?
Toussaint Trader 01|Oy…! Master witcher! Ugh… Come here, please!
Toussaint Trader 01|And what's the situation?
Toussaint Trader 01|Why, for that much I could hire an entire team of knights errant!
Toussaint Trader 01|Well, that's closer to sensible… but still too much.
Toussaint Trader 01|A fair offer.
Toussaint Trader 01|I've had my fill of haggling. Will you take the job or not?
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Blacksmith 03|Ah, my savior! Do you need something?
Geralt|Show me what you have.
Geralt|Can you craft me something?
Geralt|What were you doing in the Caroberta Woods? And how'd you wind up a prisoner of those bandits?
Toussaint Blacksmith 03|Ever since the count died, I've not had the resources to buy raw materials - meaning no new barrel hoops, no tools… So I mustered a few lads and went in the woods to scavenge.
Toussaint Blacksmith 03|A great deal of scrap to be had in those elven ruins, if you don't mind digging. Folk say the place is haunted, but I've no fear of elven ghosts!
Geralt|A rational man.
Toussaint Blacksmith 03|Rational or superstitious, it matters not. The point is, I did not see a single ghost. Yet a hanse, yes, that we ran into. Though it seems I've more luck than sense, because you came along to save me!
Geralt|See you.
Toussaint Blacksmith 03|I thank you, sir! Were it not for you, well… Those bandits were not pulling pranks!
Toussaint Blacksmith 03|I could pound some new steel for you, in gratitude. But I must first return to my workshop in Belgaard.
Geralt|Let's go, no time to lose.
Geralt|Drop by when I'm in the area.
Toussaint Blacksmith 03|See you in Belgaard!
Toussaint Blacksmith 03|I thank you again for your aid! Care to glance at my wares?
Toussaint Blacksmith 03|Save me! Sir! Help!
Toussaint Blacksmith 03|Master Witcher! The debt I owe I can never hope to repay, not in all my life!
Toussaint Blacksmith 03|First, you ripped me from the hanse's clutches. Now… now, thanks to you, the vineyard prospers like never before! You, sir, are owed a very good price on my goods!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Inkeeper Man 02|Normally I'd encourage you to try our famed Fisherman's Chowder, but alas… we are all out of crayfish.
Geralt|Could replace them with something else. Perch, for example…
Toussaint Inkeeper Man 02|Replace crayfish with fish! I beg you! What next? Vinegar for wine? Parsley for thyme? Ehh, you Nordlings are a pleasant lot, but about cuisine you know nothing.
Geralt|Show me what you got in stock?
Geralt|Not likely to taste your famous Fisherman's Chowder, so maybe we could play some gwent?
Geralt|Got any gossip? Fishermen talking about anything interesting?
Toussaint Inkeeper Man 02|Yes. About a Nordling who would replace crayfish with pike.
Geralt|Asked a serious question.
Toussaint Inkeeper Man 02|Mhm. And a tactless one. I do not eavesdrop on my clients, and I certainly don't repeat anything I chance to hear!
Geralt|Thanks. So long.
Toussaint Inkeeper Man 02|Greetings! What do you need?
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Inkeeper Woman 01|Greetings, sir. What is it you need?
Geralt|Hm. Had wine on my mind all day.
Toussaint Inkeeper Woman 01|What kind? Red, white, rosé? Dry, semi-dry, sweet? How heavy? What appellation?
Geralt|Hmm. I'll need to think about it.
Geralt|Show me what you got behind the counter.
Geralt|Tell me something about the area, would you?
Toussaint Inkeeper Woman 01|Hmm… What's there to tell…? That the master of these lands, Monsieur de Bourbeau, is the greatest buffoon in all Toussaint?
Geralt|Really? Hm. Thanks. Keep an eye out in that case.
Geralt|Uh, yeah… Already had the pleasure. Or the pain, more like.
Geralt|Time I was on my way. See you.
Toussaint Inkeeper Woman 01|Welcome back! What shall I pour you?
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Armourer 01|Oh, no, yet another fugitive from the North. Why are you here?
Geralt|Don't know if you noticed, but I just saved your ass.
Toussaint Armourer 01|Yes, yes, though not without a reward in mind, I wager. I know your kind.
Geralt|Course. And I'll want a share of your beggars' alms, too. Wanted to take a look at your goods first. May I?
Toussaint Armourer 01|Hrmph. I suppose… but you're to touch nothing and on purchasing pay in full in hard currency. Understood?
Geralt|Show me your wares. Promise not to touch anything.
Geralt|Like you to craft something for me. I'll pay, of course.
Geralt|Nordlings - what about them bothers you so much?
Toussaint Armourer 01|Apart from the fact they are all thieves, liars and layabouts? Not a thing.
Geralt|Gotta go. So long.
Toussaint Armourer 01|What do you seek here? Go back, Nord-ding, across the Yaruga! Go home!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Blacksmith 03|You don't look a quarryman to me.
Geralt|That stand in the way of our doing business?
Toussaint Blacksmith 03|No. It merely means I doubt you'll find anything of use here. I mainly stock goods for the men at the quarry - hammers, spikes, hand cream. But if you want a glance, feel free, I shan't stop you.
Geralt|Show me what you got.
Geralt|Craft something for me, will you?
Geralt|You always this personable, or d'you just get up on the wrong side of the bed this morning?
Toussaint Blacksmith 03|I got up on the right side. I always do. My left leg's been lame ever since my accident.
Toussaint Blacksmith 03|I worked here once, see, breaking stone… until a part of a rock face fell away and crushed my foot.
Geralt|Hm. Sorry. Feel foolish, now.
Toussaint Blacksmith 03|Not to worry. Such things are commonplace here, part of the job. Every now and then someone breaks something, twists an ankle… or their neck.
Geralt|Gotta go. Farewell.
Toussaint Blacksmith 03|You again? Well, out with it - what do you want?
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Armourer 02|Witcher! Von Wittan's bane!
Geralt|Your goods - mind if I have a glance?
Geralt|Hm… might need you to craft something for me…
Geralt|Seems the hanse was prepared for a long siege…
Toussaint Armourer 02|Oh, yes. The rats had woven quite the nest. Some knights errant took swipes at them, but cracked their claws on those… ruins.
Geralt|Not surprised. Von Wittan turned that rubble into a fortress. With a ballista in the lower courtyard, no less.
Toussaint Armourer 02|Well, that machine was most like there to fight off the winged lizards. A whole host live in these hills.
Toussaint Armourer 02|Alert eye on the sky at all times, witcher.
Geralt|Thanks. Farewell.
Toussaint Armourer 02|Good luck on your Path!
Toussaint Armourer 02|Most honored witcher! The slaughter of Filibert Fourfingers von Wittan - quite the feat. You've my respect and gratitude, for ever and always!
Toussaint Armourer 02|He'd squatted in those ruins for months, him and that hanse of his. Whoever they captured alive lived to regret not having been cleaved in battle.
Geralt|Managed to assemble a pretty good bunch of men…
Toussaint Armourer 02|Refuse from all the world. Bandits, degenerates. Drawn like flies to doo-doo.
Toussaint Armourer 02|It is good you felled them to a man. You've my gratitude, and good prices for all time here!
Toussaint Armourer 02|Master witcher! Might I have a moment, please?
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Barber 02|The werewolf… did you kill it?
Geralt|Mhm.
Toussaint Barber 02|It murdered folk, devoured sheep, ravaged the farm… Oh, what a relief that's done with! I thank you!
Toussaint Barber 02|If you wish, I shall give you a trim. I just need a moment - my hands are still shaking!
Geralt|What's a barber do on a farm like this?
Toussaint Barber 02|He shears sheep. Because sheep are calm, unlikely to scream at him if a lock is out of place or a color a touch off the desired shade…
Toussaint Barber 02|And here no one threatens to shorten you by a head if you trim a bit too much!
Geralt|Somebody threaten to do that to you?
Toussaint Barber 02|To me? Noooo. But… hm, well, one hears things!
Toussaint Barber 02|I found it impossible to work, under incessant pressure! When I saw the notice - "Urgent! Specialist sheep shearer sought!" - well, I didn't give it a second thought! And it was pleasant, at first… but then that werewolf appeared…
Geralt|Take care, now.
Toussaint Barber 02|Witcher! Snip, snip. Need a trim?
Toussaint Barber 02|Hey there! Witcher! Come, we must speak.
<|endoftext|>
Poviss Wine Merchant|Ah, good to see you again. What can I do for you?
Geralt|What you got an offer? Wouldn't mind a glance.
Geralt|Not from around here, are you?
Poviss Wine Merchant|Nay, from Poviss we are. Wandered south for the clime afore the first war. Chills up north were givin' my wifey lumbago.
Geralt|So long.
Poviss Wine Merchant|Any chance you'll give 'er another think?
Geralt|Fine. I'll have a look in the cave, see what lurks there.
Geralt|Could help. Provided you can pay.
Geralt|Sorry, can't say I'm interested. So long.
Geralt|Been to the cave. Full of monsters, all right - gargoyles. Safe now, though, I guarantee it.
Poviss Wine Merchant|Bugger me! That is what I call good, efficient service!
Poviss Wine Merchant|Storehouse will be ready in two days at the most… And here on in, you've cut-rate prices on all my goods!
Poviss Wine Merchant|Whoa there, sir! I'd guess those swords on your back aren't there as festoons. Maybe you could 'elp me?
Geralt|Maybe. Depends.
Poviss Wine Merchant|Well, there's a cave that to my mind would be splendid for agin' wine. Not over dry, and none too moist…
Geralt|But?
Poviss Wine Merchant|Well, damn thing's full o' noise, the arse-clenchin' sort, clinkety-bangity-knockity kind. Sent my clerk in to see. Been two days, and he's not back.
Poviss Wine Merchant|I reckon it's ought to do with the elven ruins - blech! - that abut the cave. So? Lend us a hand, will you?
Geralt|Yeah. All taken care of.
Poviss Wine Merchant|Hah! And folk call witchers layabouts and freeloaders. Bollocks!
Poviss Wine Merchant|All clear now? Did you manage it?
Geralt|Not yet. But stay away from there for now. Air inside's unhealthy.
Poviss Wine Merchant|Argh… Fate's a bitch gone in the teeth. Where am I to find another cave as snug as that?
Poviss Wine Merchant|Some evil's afoot in that cave. It's made its lair there! It's swallowed Fillon whole!
Poviss Wine Merchant|Is it over, is it done?
Poviss Wine Merchant|Whoa, mate! Can't possibly pay you that much!
Poviss Wine Merchant|Hm, yes, we's almost there…
Poviss Wine Merchant|Agreed.
Poviss Wine Merchant|I'd be wantin' to bring this to a close about now. Will you do it or no?

Toussaint Herbalist Woman 03|Leaping Lebioda! We're saved! My hero.
Geralt|No hero. Just a witcher. Slaying monsters is my job.
Toussaint Herbalist Woman 03|Brave and humble! Oh, my! Oh ho hooo…!
Geralt|What're you offering, what can I buy?
Toussaint Herbalist Woman 03|The best herbs in all Toussaint!
Geralt|Run this vineyard all by our lonesome?
Toussaint Herbalist Woman 03|Ooh, no… My father's the vintner. Oh, an excellent one, too. I merely help out.
Geralt|So where's your father?
Toussaint Herbalist Woman 03|In the hospital, after he was wounded by those monsters. But he gets better by the day!
Geralt|Take care.
Toussaint Herbalist Woman 03|Please do stop in if you're ever around.
Toussaint Herbalist Woman 03|Hail, my hero.
Toussaint Herbalist Woman 03|Witcher! Hero! Come visit with me!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Inkeeper Woman 02|Welcome to my humble establishment! What land do you hail from?
Geralt|Ehh… Been on the road so long, don't know how to answer that. Let's just say I'm from the North.
Toussaint Inkeeper Woman 02|Aaah… Is it true what they say? About the war, death, destruction all about…?
Geralt|Exaggerated. Not by much, though.
Toussaint Inkeeper Woman 02|Ah, forgive my asking, but I've family in Aedirn, see. So I'm curious… But please do tell me what I can do for you.
Geralt|Show me what you're selling?
Geralt|You play much gwent? Up for a quick match. maybe?
Geralt|Mentioned you have family in Aedirn…? Whereabout? If you don't mind my asking.
Toussaint Inkeeper Woman 02|In Vengerberg. You've been there, perhaps?
Geralt|Uh, yeah. Number of times. It's the hometown of my… Hm.
Geralt|Friend, let's say.
Geralt|Ahem. At any rate, pretty town, Vengerberg. Also didn't suffer too much during the invasion, from what I know.
Toussaint Inkeeper Woman 02|Phew, that is a relief to hear! A weight off my shoulders, I tell you!
Geralt|Of someone very dear to me.
Geralt|Should be going. Farewell.
Toussaint Inkeeper Woman 02|So nice to see you again! What do you need?
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Herbalist Woman 03|Welcome back!
Geralt|Show me what you got.
Geralt|Master Liam doesn't seem a diligent proprietor…
Toussaint Herbalist Woman 03|He tries as best he can! It's not his fault our vineyard's suffered plague upon plague…
Geralt|Plagues? What kind?
Toussaint Herbalist Woman 03|Well, the enormous, yellow, man-eating sundews, for instance! You cannot set foot into the brush for fear of coming out a head shorter.
Geralt|Thanks, see you later.
Toussaint Herbalist Woman 03|Thank you again for the rescue! Look for me at the Coronata should you pass by.
Toussaint Herbalist Woman 03|Thank you, noble knight! I'd ventured north in search of herbs for a new flavored wine, when suddenly…
Geralt|Calm down, it's over.
Toussaint Herbalist Woman 03|The bungdiddlers kidnapped me - in hopes of collecting a ransom, I'm sure. But with Master Liam's troubles, he never could have paid them.
Toussaint Herbalist Woman 03|Ah, but I'm free and safe! Thanks to you! Should you need any herbs, I've a hearty stock at the Coronata. Will you walk me there?
Geralt|Lead the way, right behind you.
Geralt|Need to look around here some more. But I'll be sure to stop by if I'm ever in the area.
Toussaint Herbalist Woman 03|I shall be waiting.
Toussaint Herbalist Woman 03|Here we are. Once again, I thank you for the rescue! Wish to look over my stock?
Toussaint Herbalist Woman 03|Geralt! You did it - you managed to reconcile Coronata and Vermentino! Incredible! Master Liam has asked me to give you the best prices!
Toussaint Herbalist Woman 03|Help! Sir! Save me!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Inkeeper Woman 03|Wipe your boots before you take another step! Don't slurp your food! Don't eat with your hands! Don't pick your teeth with your knife!
Geralt|What?
Toussaint Inkeeper Woman 03|Oh, I'm just jesting. You, sir, clearly were not born in a barn! Welcome to the Pheasantry, the best auberge in all the duchy!
Geralt|What're you serving up today?
Geralt|I know you're busy, but… round of gwent?
Geralt|Spoon like this - when you set a place, where's it go?
Toussaint Inkeeper Woman 03|My oh my, it seems rather a fanciful bouillon spoon… or a key of some sort! There's a note here…
Geralt|Yeah. Note led me here. Any idea what the key might open?
Toussaint Inkeeper Woman 03|Never seen it before. But you might search the cellars. The previous owner left all sorts of knick knacks there.
Geralt|See you later.
Toussaint Inkeeper Woman 03|Welcome to the Pheasantry!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Armourer 03|The best armor around! That is what I forge! Ah, so sorry.
Geralt|Hm, what've you got there?
Geralt|Need something crafted. You willing?
Geralt|Seem an expert. Got some diagrams - interest you, maybe?
Toussaint Armourer 03|Hm, indeed, indeed, they do!
Toussaint Armourer 03|Save, I fear I simply don't understand them.
Geralt|Know anyone who might manage to decipher them?
Toussaint Armourer 03|I'd advise you to see Lazare Lafargue. You will find him near the Metinna Gate. The man takes to the obscure with zeal.
Geralt|Up for a round of gwent?
Geralt|So long.
Toussaint Armourer 03|You need new britches? Gauntlets, perhaps? What say you, fair knight?
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Blacksmith 01|Oh, look! A witcher graces my humble forge.
Geralt|Show me what you have.
Geralt|Think you could craft something for me?
Geralt|Wanna place a special order. Think you can handle it?
Toussaint Blacksmith 01|How special is it to be?
Geralt|Got these diagrams. Take a look, judge for yourself.
Toussaint Blacksmith 01|Tsk, alas. It's black magic to me. But I know one who could help you.
Toussaint Blacksmith 01|You must try Lafargue. His smithy lies near the Metinna Gate.
Geralt|Farewell.
Toussaint Blacksmith 01|No. See you later!
Toussaint Blacksmith 01|The best steel in all of Toussaint! Take a gander.
Toussaint Blacksmith 01|Eh, bumbersnatch. Happens to the best. It serves me right for challenging a stranger. To have such a deck, ah….
Geralt|So long.
Toussaint Blacksmith 01|Hm, I expected more of you. But, I suppose you put in an honest effort. You know what they say - tables are like day-old fish, apt to turn on you when you least expect it.
Geralt|Right…
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Trader 02|Whoa! A witcher! A serious client, at last! Tell me, what do you need? Honeysuckle? Ginatia petals?
Geralt|Show me what you've got in stock.
Geralt|In the mood for a round of gwent?
Geralt|How's business?
Toussaint Trader 02|The coin is good, but… just between us, I'm going batty with boredom.
Toussaint Trader 02|I know what my customers want before they open their mouths. Bald men - birch sap. Ladies of all walks - whatever fragrance Duchess Anarietta prefers at the time.
Toussaint Trader 02|If just once somebody would order some poison… ehh.
Geralt|Need to get going. Till next time.
Toussaint Trader 02|Welcome back, master!
<|endoftext|>
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|Welcome, welcome! So good to have you back.
Geralt|Wanna let loose, enjoy myself…
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|Of course. Talk to the girls - I'm certain they will do all in their power, and it's quite a lot, believe you me.
Geralt|Cozy place you got.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|I'm pleased you noticed.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|You see, when I had set aside enough to found my own establishment, I wished it to be not a bawdy house, but a bawdy home. A place where patrons would not simply come, drop their hose, then flee as soon as the girl rolled over.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|Here, the sheets do not reek of sweat, the beds have no bedbugs, and the wine is not watered down. It is a place where one longs to linger - to chat, sprawled in a comfortable chair, to light a pipe. All after paying a modest fee, of course…
Geralt|Interested in the unusual, got a special request. Just, need to keep this between you and me.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|You know well I shouldn't… Eh, who cares. How might I help?
Geralt|Gwent - you play?
Geralt|Gotta go. See you later.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|Step into my parlor, my good sir! What brings you to Toussaint? Tell me.
Geralt|Hm. Let's call it business.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|Ah, then… a "professional journey." Nothing but work, tension, unfamiliar beds… One needs a way to relax atimes.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|Perhaps my girls could help you.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Me again. Real-life witcher.
Geralt|Let's go upstairs.
Beauclair Prostitute 01|Come.
Geralt|The, uh… playing at being a witcher thing - what's that about?
Beauclair Prostitute 01|It's the latest rage. A trick will come, dressed in a studded jacket, two swords on his back - and ask me to play a succubus or a siren.
Beauclair Prostitute 01|Then he'll say he has a contract, but his codex says he cannot harm a thinking being, so perhaps we can make a deal…. Once it's over, he demands some kind of card. I've no notion how it started… They probably took the idea from one of those silly ballads.
Geralt|Mhm. Got a strong suspicion who the author might be.
Geralt|Sorry. Gotta go.
Beauclair Prostitute 01|Oh, boy. Another one.
Geralt|What's that? Another what?
Beauclair Prostitute 01|Did Madame Isabelle mention role-playing cost extra? If you wish to play at being a witcher, then…
Geralt|Misunderstanding, I'm afraid. I am a witcher.
Beauclair Prostitute 01|Of course, the eyes… I should have noticed. Forgive me, master… Come into my alcove. I shall more than make up for my error there.
Beauclair Prostitute 01|You've come back. They always come back for me.
Beauclair Prostitute 02|Oh. You're pretty.
Geralt|Get paid to say that.
Beauclair Prostitute 02|I get paid to plough. Compliments I give only when the urge strikes me.
Beauclair Prostitute 02|So, willing to show me if your birthday suit is equally becoming?
Geralt|Let's go somewhere secluded. Hm?
Geralt|Don't beat around the bush, do you.
Beauclair Prostitute 02|I dislike pretending to be someone I am not. All the sighs, fainting, fluttering eyelashes… it's just not me.
Beauclair Prostitute 02|I operate on the assumption that if a man seeks coyness, he does not go to a brothel.
Geralt|Right about that. Definitely had something else in mind.
Beauclair Prostitute 02|Then come and show me.
Geralt|Be back later.
Beauclair Prostitute 02|Hold you to that.
Beauclair Prostitute 02|Mind made up?
Beauclair Prostitute 02|Well, well. My favorite swordsman.
Beauclair Prostitute 03|Shhh.
Beauclair Prostitute 03|You needn't apologize. You needn't worry about a thing. You've come to enjoy some pleasant moments. To rest. To relax.
Beauclair Prostitute 03|Let me help you do just that.
Geralt|Take me to your room?
Beauclair Prostitute 03|With pleasure.
Geralt|Tell me a bit about yourself.
Beauclair Prostitute 03|My name is Madeleine. I like to walk barefoot in the grass, read by candlelight and drink young wine straight from the bottle.
Geralt|You're sweet.
Beauclair Prostitute 03|Don't let appearances fool you. Hmhm…
Geralt|Sorry… gotta go.
Beauclair Prostitute 03|Changed your mind…?
Beauclair Prostitute 03|Nice to see you again, Geralt.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Trader 02|Ah! My witcher friend! Greetings, greetings!
Geralt|Mind showing me what you're selling?
Geralt|Caves peaceful now? No more trouble?
Toussaint Trader 02|None… But why do you ask?
Geralt|Shaelmaars're hard sometimes to get rid of for good. Live deep underground, no way to get at them… until they get hungry. Then they surface to feed.
Toussaint Trader 02|Ah…aha. And what am I to do then?
Geralt|Send for me. Give you my discount for regular customers.
Geralt|See you later.
Toussaint Trader 02|So? Well?
Geralt|Haven't seen to your problem just yet. A little patient, huh?
Geralt|Problem solved. Shaelmaar that lived in the cave won't pester you any more.
Toussaint Trader 02|Suuuu-perb! I've gained a warehouse… And you've gained my gratitude!
Toussaint Trader 02|You, sir, are a witcher? The very one the duquessa summoned?
Geralt|Guilty as charged. And you gotta be someone who wants something from me.
Toussaint Trader 02|It's like you read my mind! You see… those caves are like cellars the gods carved out for their own stores. Spacious, dry…
Geralt|Just some monster lives inside 'em.
Toussaint Trader 02|A soothsayer! Gods be gelded, a soothsayer! So, will you help?
Geralt|Sure, I'll see to it. For the sizable reward I foresee you giving me.
Geralt|Might help, might not. Depends on whether we can agree on a fee.
Geralt|Sorry, can't help you at the moment.
Toussaint Trader 02|The witcher who sees the future! What will be? Will you help?
Toussaint Trader 02|Hey-ho! Master witcher!
Toussaint Trader 02|Well, nearly there…
Toussaint Trader 02|My, my, we clearly think highly of ourselves. I don't have it.
Toussaint Trader 02|I cannot know what the duquessa's pledged to pay you, but I simply don't have that much.
Toussaint Trader 02|Good, yes. So be it.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Armourer 03|Seems you did our work for us.
Geralt|If it was your job to exterminate them - yeah, I did.
Toussaint Armourer 03|They were like an ulcer on Toussaint's derriere. Loth Halfbreed, the most cankerous of them all.
Geralt|Mind if I have a look at your goods?
Toussaint Armourer 03|Be my guest. I've top-notch armor. But as an expert, you'll see that for yourself.
Geralt|Make armor to order?
Toussaint Armourer 03|Of course. If I didn't what sort of craftsman would I be? Just tell me your needs, and I'll make sure to meet them in full.
Geralt|This Loth Halfbreed - part elf?
Toussaint Armourer 03|You might have had a look before you tore out his innards.
Toussaint Armourer 03|He was called Halfbreed, rumored to be a half-elf, but in truth? Who knows. Besides, how is one to know a half-elf? By one normal ear, one pointy? I've no notion.
Geralt|Probably right.
Toussaint Armourer 03|You mean they really have two different ears?
Geralt|No. You really don't know a thing about them.
Geralt|So long.
Toussaint Armourer 03|Welcome back, witcher.
Toussaint Armourer 03|Hey! Witcher! Might you have a moment?
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Inkeeper Woman 03|Praised be our Lord Lebioda! You come in his name, you are his avatar!
Geralt|Nope, just a witcher who happened to be passing through…
Toussaint Inkeeper Woman 03|By the Prophet's intervention! He was your guide, he nudged your footsteps here!
Geralt|If you say so…
Toussaint Inkeeper Woman 03|What shall we call you, hero?
Geralt|I'm Geralt. Geralt of Rivia.
Toussaint Inkeeper Woman 03|Geralt… Lovely it rings! Sacred it sounds. Do you thirst? Or hunger?
Geralt|Hm. Lemme see what you're serving.
Geralt|Know much of the local history? Found a few elven scrolls while wandering around in the area…
Toussaint Inkeeper Woman 03|…
Geralt|These notes… they describe what happened to the elves who used to live here in Fox Hollow…
Toussaint Inkeeper Woman 03|I know nothing. Now would like ought to eat, or to drink?
Geralt|Take care, now.
Toussaint Inkeeper Woman 03|You are sorely missed already!
Toussaint Inkeeper Woman 03|Geralt of Rivia! Our savior!
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 01|If me eyes don't deceive me, you are the White Wolf - warrior, lover, philosopher extraordinaire…
Geralt|Someone's fed you a load of...
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 01|And a friend of the Great Master Dandelion himself!
Geralt|The Great Master Dandelion?
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 01|Aye, who built you a monument more lasting than any of bronze. When next you see him, White Wolf, please convey the great esteem in which I, Sigurd, hold his many achievements.
Geralt|Oh, I'll be sure to tell him exactly what I think of his... tales.
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 01|It would be a disgrace to censor such an artist. Though a smith by trade, I too do my best work in words.
Geralt|Wouldn't mind a look at your wares.
Geralt|See you.
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 01|White Wolf!
<|endoftext|>
Blacksmith Woman|How can I help ye?
Geralt|Need some armor made. Witcher's armor.
Geralt|What're you selling, what's good?
Geralt|Interesting lilt in your voice. You originally from Skellige?
Blacksmith Woman|Ard Skellig. Spent my whole childhood in Holmstein.
Geralt|Why'd you leave?
Blacksmith Woman|Always had a liking for the smithy. I'd sit there all day, taking things in - the heat of the furnace, the smell of hot steel, the pounding hammers…
Blacksmith Woman|At seventeen winters, me da told me he could teach me no more. Sent me out there into the world, bid me to hone my craft.
Blacksmith Woman|A few years on, I had my master crafting papers. Then the war broke out and I landed here…
Geralt|Up for a few rounds of gwent?
Geralt|Take care, now.
Blacksmith Woman|Geralt! Good of you to come by. What can I do for you?
<|endoftext|>
Beauclair Banker Woman 02|Welcome to Cianfanelli Bank, where we look after your coin as if it were our own and the customer's always right. How might I be of service?
Geralt|Got an account here. Like to make a withdrawal.
Beauclair Banker Woman 02|Naturally. Your name?
Geralt|Geralt of Rivia.
Beauclair Banker Woman 02|Wait a moment, please, while I find the relevant record.
Beauclair Banker Woman 02|I'm afraid I can't help you. Extraordinary circumstances, you see? There's a note in the records - the account holder is dead.
Geralt|That's inaccurate, as you can see.
Beauclair Banker Woman 02|It's some kind of mistake. The note is clearly in error. To reactivate the account, you'll need Permit A38.
Beauclair Banker Woman 02|For more information, please go to window number one.
Geralt|About my account. Again…
Beauclair Banker Woman 02|Yes? How can I help?
Geralt|Form 202 - can I have a copy?
Beauclair Banker Woman 02|Oh, no, none here, I'm afraid. Please ask in Archives or in Records.
Geralt|Sorry, where can I get a copy of Permit A38?
Beauclair Banker Woman 02|Hmm… Let me think… Marianne, dear, would you know who has A38s?
Beauclair Banker Woman 02|Very sorry, we simply don't know. You must ask around.
Geralt|There any way I could get this done quicker, without the permit, maybe?
Beauclair Banker Woman 02|Very sorry, but that's impossible. Circular N60, the latest, is very clear on the point - Permit A38 is absolutely necessary.
Geralt|Got something else I need.
Beauclair Banker Woman 02|Yes?
Geralt|I'd like to change some coin.
Beauclair Banker Woman 02|By all means.
Geralt|Come by later.
Beauclair Banker Woman 02|Ever at your service, sir.
Beauclair Banker Woman 01|Are you blind, sir? I'm at work, here.
Beauclair Banker Man 01|I'm sorry, I've no time just now. Please see someone else.
Beauclair Banker Woman 03|Yes? No, I'm not the one you need, definitely.
Beauclair Banker Man 02|Please bother someone else.
Beauclair Banker Man 03|There's a catch… Zzz… Catch-22… Zzzzzz….
Beauclair Banker Man 03|Zzzz… Coin… always… ahem… right.
Beauclair Banker Woman 02|We will no longer serve you here. Please go.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Hm… What're you selling, exactly?
Toussaint Trader 01|Top quality dyes. Guaranteed to produce intense colors that never bleed!
Geralt|Ah. None for me, thanks.
Toussaint Trader 01|What do you mean?! Even the best warrior must look kempt, care for his appearance! For example, he might favor bright colors, to stand out from the crowd, or dark, to slip unseen through his lover's window by night.
Geralt|Hm… Usually focus on armor's other attributes, color's not so important… But I guess there's some sense to what you say.
Toussaint Trader 01|There certainly is! Please, peruse and purchase! You shall not be disappointed!
Geralt|Fine, show me what you got.
Geralt|Dyeing clothes a popular service around here? Never come across something like this before…
Toussaint Trader 01|For in the North all is gray, drab and muted… quite the opposite to Toussaint! Here, look around and you will see the green of verdant hills, the deep blue of the lake, and the blood red of wine! It's no wonder we love our dyes.
Toussaint Trader 01|A lady will change the color of her dress to match her mood. To green when she is jealous, to yellow when she wishes to radiate joy. A knight, in turn, might with color signal the nature of his vow - white to show he's made a vow of chastity, for instance.
Geralt|Hmm… need to stop introducing myself as the "White Wolf," then.
Geralt|Gotta go. So long.
Toussaint Trader 01|What dye shall it be, sir? Aquamarine? Ashen white?
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Innkeeper 01|Hey, stranger. Lookin' for some entertainment? Want a drink?
Geralt|What kind of entertainment you got in mind?
Skellige Innkeeper 01|What? Why, beer, mead and strong spirits. Whaddaya expect in a tavern? Jump rope?
Skellige Innkeeper 01|Don't know where you're from, but I can see it's far off.
Geralt|Show me what you have in stock.
Geralt|The Brokvar clan - can you tell me about it?
Skellige Innkeeper 01|We from the Brokvar clan are masters of the sea, bred and born to the water.
Geralt|Thought everyone in Skellige spent a lot of time in the water.
Skellige Innkeeper 01|Hahaha, they think so, too. But all they do is skim the top of it in their longships, all wrapped up in heavy furs.
Skellige Innkeeper 01|From time to time the wind blows a bit of spray from the oars in their faces - that's their only contact with water. Whereas our boys, as soon as they can walk, dive off cliffs into the very depths of the sea.
Geralt|Take care.
Skellige Innkeeper 01|Hey. Choose your poison and don't try any tricks.

Kamerling|Greetings, knight.
Geralt|Wouldn't mind a glance at your books. Ones you're willing to sell, that is.
Geralt|Can't help but be curious, but where do the funds for those payments come from?
Kamerling|The ducal treasury, of course. Her Illustrious Highness Anna Henrietta assigns great value to bravery and selfless patriotism.
Kamerling|It is her standing order that any knight may receive a wage…
Kamerling|Akh akh. Pardon me - financial compensation for his dedication to defending the duchy's internal security and order.
Geralt|Well, see you later.
Kamerling|Go in peace, fair knight.
Kamerling|Greetings, brave hero. I am Rafael de Surmann, and I am the ducal camerlengo.
Geralt|I'm Geralt. So what is it you do here?
Kamerling|I pay the knights errant.
Geralt|For what?
Kamerling|Our knights wander the roads, protecting Toussaint from bandits and monsters… It is fitting and just that they be recompensed appropriately for these toils.
Kamerling|Err, note, sir, that should you successfully smash a hanse, save a brother knight from peril or extract a captured merchant from the hands of cutthroats, come see me - you shall be rewarded.
Kamerling|Speaking of payment…
Kamerling|I've heard reports of feats of great bravery. Thus, please accept this reward for your dedication, sir.
Kamerling|My most heartfelt gratitude, sir. Compensation for your sacrifice…
Kamerling|My clerks have brought word of heroic deeds on your part. Please accept this compensation for your toil, good sir.
Kamerling|Much is said in Beauclair of your bravery and dedication. Thus, you've secured a claim to compensation. Sign here, please.
Kamerling|Please accept this compensation for your toil, good sir.

Circus Merchant|Welcome, welcome! What would you say to a hand or two of gwent?
Geralt|Uhh… not gonna try to sell me something first?
Circus Merchant|My goods are not swallows, they will not flit nor flee.
Geralt|Cards won't, either.
Circus Merchant|Do you wish to split hairs all day, or play gwent? Hm?
Geralt|Like to take a look at your wares.
Circus Merchant|Like to take a look at your wares.
Geralt|So, should we lay 'em down?
Circus Merchant|Yes, yes, yes! You needn't ask twice!
Geralt|Feels like you might've missed your calling.
Circus Merchant|Oh? Curious conclusion. Why?
Geralt|Well, should be hawking goods. Instead, gwent's all you talk about.
Circus Merchant|Hmmm… You're right! So, care for a match?
Geralt|Should be going…
Circus Merchant|If ever you need a partner for gwent… you know where to find me!
Circus Merchant|Well, then? Shall we lay down some gwent?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Greetings.
Skellige Old Man 04|Hmm… Don't know you. Come closer, let me get a good look. Sight's not what it once was… Now coins're all I see well.
Geralt|All right, just don't be frightened, gramps. I'm a witcher.
Skellige Old Man 04|Haha. I'm not the superstitious sort, takes more than a pair o' yellow eyes to frighten me.
Skellige Old Man 04|Witcher, eh? There were some of youse on Faroe, long ago. Me father told me about it. Ah, but you come here to buy somethin', not listen to me tales.
Geralt|Wouldn't mind a look at your wares, gramps.
Geralt|I'd love to hear some tales. Word is people from Faroe are…
Skellige Old Man 04|…scoundrels and villains?! Who fed you this slander? Them cowards from Spikeroog?
Geralt|Actually, that's not what I've heard at all… Hm, guess there's no love lost between clans Dimun and Brokvar?
Skellige Old Man 04|None in the isles likes us much. Started way back with Lovis of Ard Skellig - a stunnin' fair lass. Hordes of suitors sought to win her hand.
Skellige Old Man 04|Her father declared she'd go to the one who brought him back his ring. And when he went to toss this ring into the sea…
Geralt|…the young jarl an Dimun kicked his legs out from under him, tore the ring off his finger and won the hand of the lovely Lovis.
Skellige Old Man 04|Hehe! Witcher, sure you wouldn't fancy stayin' on here on Faroe? You'd fit right in.
Geralt|These witchers who came to Faroe - tell me more about them?
Skellige Old Man 04|Aye, aye… The isle was riddled with monsters - snarks, toves, mome raths… It's for the beasts the witchers came…
Geralt|Never heard of those monsters. Are those local names?
Skellige Old Man 04|You’ve not heard of 'em, 'cause they are no more. The witchers did well by the isle, and left Faroe a pretty penny richer.
Geralt|Take care, now.
Skellige Old Man 04|Ah, it's you, witcher. Recognized the padding of your paws: quiet as a cat, y'are. Whaddaya need?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Greetings.
Hakland Enchanter|Greetings, and praise the world in its never-ending creation.
Geralt|Don't take this the wrong way, but, honestly, world doesn't deserve much praise.
Hakland Enchanter|Ehh, Nordlings. Hm. Disagreeable always, faces crinkled, soured, ready to quibble to death even a simple greeting.
Hakland Enchanter|Aha! But my tongue now has soured, while you for trade have come. Sadly, I can forge for you nothing - my belongings, tools inclusive, all lost.
Geralt|Seems your skills could be useful to me. Given that, I'd be happy to help you out.
Geralt|What do you say I get you the coin you need? Could pay me back in runes and glyphs.
Hakland Enchanter|Is it certain your offer? A great sum I require. Tools of great expense I need to make even the simplest glyph. I make no mention of the more advanced or master-crafted.
Geralt|Rest easy. Got a feeling this'll be a good investment.
Geralt|Got some coin on me. This enough?
Hakland Enchanter|A… start it is.
Geralt|Costly craft.
Hakland Enchanter|Yet the costs do not end with coin. Need I shall also a jade stone of size substantial.
Geralt|Hm, see what I can do.
Geralt|Can't help but wonder what brings you to our lands.
Hakland Enchanter|A simple thing - for knowledge a thirst. All he could my mentor had taught me. The tongues of our lands I'd learned, of all our plants and animals I know the names.
Geralt|Risked that long a journey to learn new words?
Hakland Enchanter|A life of plenty I would have lived at home, for the beauty and import of my art are respected. But such a life would be unfulfilled.
Hakland Enchanter|Great and diverse is the world, for apace continues its creation. A riddle it is which through symbols speaks.
Hakland Enchanter|The world's tongue to learn I wish. The signs by which it speaks to discover, their syntax to master. Through this to learn the principles of creation.
Geralt|Way you talk about your art, sound more like a man of faith than scholarship.
Hakland Enchanter|Faith and scholarship for you lie in conflict. Yet in my land, holy men are scholars, wisdom their source of esteem.
Geralt|The Ofieri believe in any gods?
Hakland Enchanter|From region to region this varies. Raised I was to believe in one God - the world. Hm. Symbols are God's speech, to study His words is to draw nearer to Him.
Geralt|Symbols - meaning runes and glyphs.
Hakland Enchanter|Mere signs are these - an attempt by men imperfect to describe the world. Yet a magic to them there is, and from God all magic issues.
Hakland Enchanter|When runes I create, when into words I arrange them - this is prayer. And when into swords I enchant them, that is my benediction.
Geralt|Thanks. So long.
Geralt|You a craftsman or a mage?
Hakland Enchanter|Your tongue has no word to fit my trade. A scholar and artisan I am, part craftsman, part mage.
Hakland Enchanter|Gematria, runecraft - familiar to you are these words?
Geralt|No. Runecraft seems pretty self-explanatory, though.
Hakland Enchanter|True, though my craft further ventures. Runes and glyphs I first make, then arrange into powerful magic words.
Hakland Enchanter|Great practical applications has my art. For runestones properly forged, in a sword set so as to form a magic word, the blade more power grant than runestones set haphazardly.
Hakland Enchanter|Such words too can of glyphs be made and set in armor.
Geralt|Listen, folk sometimes hire me to solve their problems. Even retrieved a missing item or two in my time.
Hakland Enchanter|For me, this you cannot do. I sailed upon a great ship. It sank, and my instruments took to the sea's dark depths.
Geralt|Buying replacements not an option?
Hakland Enchanter|Of my own design they were, specially forged. A fortune it cost to make them. And all the coin that with me I had brought lies now in the murky abyss with my instruments.
Hakland Enchanter|Praised be the world in its never-ending creation.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Wouldn't mind a glance at what you got.
Geralt|Craft something for me, would you?
Geralt|Brought you more coin. Put it towards better equipment?
Hakland Enchanter|Thanks in the thousands! Too kind you are to me, truly.
Geralt|Your work's worth the coin.
Hakland Enchanter|Painite crystal I shall need also.
Geralt|Huh?
Hakland Enchanter|Painite, a mineral. In my lands quite rare, here impossible surely to find. Lenses I make from it, the powder residue I blend into my mixtures.
Geralt|See what I can do.
Geralt|Northern Realms - like it here so far?
Hakland Enchanter|Oh, yes! Never have I seen woodlands so expansive or skies with such colors brushed.
Hakland Enchanter|Nordlings, however… peculiar they are. Tight-lipped, closed within.
Geralt|Hm.
Hakland Enchanter|And bandits the high roads riddle. But on the horrid conflict this I blame.
Geralt|Made good use of my coin by the look of things.
Hakland Enchanter|The return to my craft - know you not the pleasure it brings. I thank you!
Geralt|Don't mention it. How's the work going?
Hakland Enchanter|Several lesser runes I've forged already - practice, you see. Heheh. Yet I sadden in thinking the tools and ingredients I possess are not fit to create better.
Geralt|Got lucky - found you some jade. Here.
Hakland Enchanter|Thank you, I do. If you to gaze wish at my handiwork, to do so I invite you.
Hakland Enchanter|The world's never-ending creation be praised.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Got a bit more coin for you. Better be all you need.
Hakland Enchanter|For tools it is enough, but ingredients rare also I req--
Geralt|Nope. Not gonna happen. Now lemme see what my coin's bought.
Geralt|Hard at work. Good to see.
Hakland Enchanter|Ah, yes! Commissioned have I tools, a fitting set. From Novigrad crafters. Many arms and legs they charged, but renew my work in earnest I now can.
Hakland Enchanter|New runes, glyphs and diagrams created I have. An eye you should cast, find one to your liking perchance.
Geralt|I might. First, got some painite for you.
Geralt|So, nothing holding you back now?
Hakland Enchanter|From making master-crafted runes, you mean? Err, much more coin I will need to do so. Sadly.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Priestess 01|Why does the goddess bring you here?
Geralt|Brought myself here, seems to me.
Skellige Priestess 01|You do not worship Freya.
Geralt|No. But I respect those that do. Including her priestesses.
Skellige Priestess 01|This does you credit, but is meaningless as well. For Freya rewards and punishes those of other faiths and infidels as she does her own. Worship her and it will help, though it will settle nothing.
Skellige Priestess 01|What do you need?
Geralt|Mind if I have a look at your wares?
Geralt|Tell me something about this temple, could you?
Skellige Priestess 01|It happened once that Freya lost her favorite white cat. She scoured the isles and finally found him here.
Skellige Priestess 01|Freya's heart filled with joy and she blessed this place. A temple was then established here.
Geralt|Didn't know Freya was into cats.
Skellige Priestess 01|Your ignorance speaks poorly of you. The white cat is the goddess' sacred animal and has deep symbolic significance.
Skellige Priestess 01|This temple is for those who seek Freya's help in finding what they desperately seek. Perhaps even you shall experience her grace.
Skellige Priestess 01|Scorn her not! Or have you friends so powerful that you can afford to spurn divine aid?
Geralt|Farewell.
Skellige Priestess 01|Welcome to the Temple of Freya.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 03|You're back.
Geralt|Hm. Lemme have a look.
Geralt|Like you to craft something for me…
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 03|What? My wares not good enough?
Geralt|Relax… They're fine, just not what I need.
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 03|Foreigners and their fancies… Fine, show me what you want.
Geralt|Got a job for you.
Geralt|Anything new in Fyresdal?
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 03|New? Nothin'.
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 03|This ain't the Continent, fashions don't change with the meltin' snows. We live like our fathers and grandfathers lived - fishin', huntin', and raidin'… And so shall we live, to Ragh nar Roog and beyond.
Geralt|So long.
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 03|Smooth sailin'.
Geralt|How are things? Business good?
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 03|Why wouldn't it be, seein' as I make the best arms in the Isles?
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 03|Just look - iron ore from the bowels of Mount Ard Faand, where giants once tore up the earth. Then my forge fire, blazin' unbroken for six generations, it's care passed from father to son.
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 03|And everyday come dawn, Hara, my youngest, she pricks her finger and squeezes a drop of her blood into the water I use to temper the blades.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Lemme see what you're offering.
Geralt|Like you to craft something for me.
Geralt|Could you make a breastplate if I provided a master's diagram?
Baron Bandit Strong 03|Nah, and nor could anyone else here. Except for… what was his…?
Geralt|Except for who?
Baron Bandit Strong 03|There was one fellow… Fergus, a dwarf. Worked for me a while, with an apprentice, a lass.
Geralt|Know what became of him?
Baron Bandit Strong 03|They were good at what they did, so they moved on to Crow's Perch. Baron, his men need smithin' all the time. No lack of work there.
Geralt|So long.
Baron Bandit Strong 03|So, you want a premade, or have you got a special order?
Geralt|Like you to craft something for me.
Baron Bandit Strong 03|Hah, my guardian and protector! I thank ye, I do!

Skellige Druid 02|Don't sell herbs.
Geralt|That's too bad. Unusual biotope here. Never seen most of these plants. Bet they have amazing properties, too.
Skellige Druid 02|You know plants?
Geralt|I do.
Skellige Druid 02|That grass with the wide blades…?
Geralt|Hinny sorrel - breaks fevers.
Skellige Druid 02|And that-there thistly one?
Geralt|Umm… thistle?
Skellige Druid 02|Well done. You can look over me stash.
Geralt|Show me what you got.
Geralt|So long.
Skellige Druid 02|You're back? Good.
Skellige Druid 02|Ah! There he is! My keeper, my savior! I'm with my kin again, thanks all to you.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 01|Greetings, White Wolf. I suspected you'd come by. Bah, I was sure of it!
Geralt|Oh yeah?
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 01|The best-stocked armory in all Skellige's right here at Kaer Trolde castle. Everyone knows it.
Geralt|I'll gladly see for myself.
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 01|Take your time, give 'em all a careful look.
Geralt|Wouldn't mind a look at your stock.
Geralt|Craft something for me, will you?
Geralt|Whaddaya think - who'll be the next king of the Isles?
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 01|Hjalmar, clear as day. Lad's brave and generous, and from Crach's own line. No better claimant.
Geralt|Looking for someone who can make me a master-quality breastplate.
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 01|Hm. Never known a master who wasn't a dwarf.
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 01|Fergus, perhaps? Say he's holed up somewhere in Velen.
Geralt|So long.
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 01|So you're back. Was right, wasn't I?
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 02|Interested in a weapon? There's a tale behind every item I've got.
Geralt|What're you peddling?
Geralt|Got a diagram. Like you to craft something for me.
Geralt|So long.
Geralt|This sword's hilt is made of meteorite steel.
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 02|No, it's made from the heart of a falling star.
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 02|Whoever wields this sword will always find his way at sea, no matter how stormy the skies.
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 02|But after a time it overwhelms its owner with sadness and longin' for its starry home. And nothin', not even good fun and good company, can cheer him up.
Geralt|Tell me a story about one of your weapons.
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 02|See this sword? You know by its crafter's mark that it was forged in the isles. Belonged to Lars, who woulda been the same age as I.
Geralt|What happened to him?
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 02|His wife went missin' durin' a nasty storm. It was said the goddess smiled fondly on her, so Lars refused to believe she was truly dead.
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 02|He ran out on the rocks and begged Freya to give his wife back. Left his sword behind to show the gods humility. And never returned for it.
Geralt|Selling that same sword now?
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 02|We coulda tossed it in the sea, but fish got no use for blades. He had no family, so I'm sellin' it… to the right man.
Geralt|Battle axe looks pretty old.
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 02|Even older than this keep, and yet still sharp.
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 02|Once each year, at Saovine, this axe speaks.
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 02|It tells of blood spilt in battles, of burnin' villages and sunken boats.
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 02|Might be a curse, and might be it drank too much human blood. What's certain is no one wants it.

Geralt|Greetings.
Skellige Merchant 01|And a most humble greeting to you, sir. Name's Karl, but Whistling Whacker they call me.
Geralt|Interesting as monikers go.
Skellige Merchant 01|When I was a lad, my pa told me, "Son, you'll be a merchant one day. If you want folk to buy from you, you gotta draw them in."
Skellige Merchant 01|"You're neither pretty nor smart nor much of a sweet-talker, so I hereby name you Whistlin' Whacker. People'll come by just to ask you what that means. Don't blow those opportunities."
Geralt|Wanted to see what you have on offer.
Skellige Merchant 01|Can't charge you for lookin'. Peruse at will.
Geralt|Harbor's real busy. Looks like Crach's marshaling his forces for war.
Skellige Merchant 01|If that weren't old gossip, I'd take you for a spy. But I know you're a friend of Crach, so I'm proud to say you're right.
Skellige Merchant 01|Come summer we'll have three new longboats: the "Hemdall," the "Kambi," and the "Wild Boar of the Sea." The last for Crach himself.
Geralt|Your clan planning to take up arms against Nilfgaard?
Skellige Merchant 01|We'll see what our new king says. But it'd be strange to see those longships just sit in the harbor.
Geralt|See you.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Greetings.
Tailor Sjusta|Smooth seas this morn. As if the gods themselves were payin' their respects to the great Konung Bran.
Geralt|You a tailor?
Tailor Sjusta|I am. Only one in the Isles, most like.
Geralt|Gladly look at what you got.
Tailor Sjusta|Wise man. No common rags among my wares.
Geralt|Take it you're good with scissors. Give me a haircut?
Tailor Sjusta|Tain't somethin' I usually do… but it wouldn't be right to turn down a traveler.
Geralt|So long.
Tailor Sjusta|Come see me again some time.
Geralt|Hey, Sjusta.
Tailor Sjusta|Hello, witcher. Good to see you, but if you come to ask 'bout new finery for the feast, I'm afraid there'll be trouble. I've only two doublets left.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Greetings. Impressive tavern.
Skellige Innkeeper 01|Tavern?! 'T'ain't no tavern! 'Tis the House of Warriors!
Geralt|Mhm. So what do folk do in the House of Warriors? Fight?
Skellige Innkeeper 01|Atimes one'll take the other and give 'im a good slappin', aye. But mostly folk come 'ere to drink, eat, warm their bones by the fire, chatter a bit, maybe listen to a skald bay to the moon.
Geralt|About what folk do at a tavern.
Skellige Innkeeper 01|*Sighs* Argh, ye Continentals don't understand a thing. Ye need some of our mead - brewed wisdom, it is!
Geralt|What're you peddling? Lemme have a look.
Geralt|Farewell.
Skellige Innkeeper 01|Yeah? What can I get ye?
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Armorer 01|Greetings. Wanna look over our stock?
Geralt|Take it everything here's for sale?
Skellige Armorer 01|Sure, if you can afford it. The Jarl's a stickler for quality so we keep no rubbish here.
Geralt|Zerrikanian zefhars, Mahakam battle axes, Viroledan short swords… Where'd you get so many Continental goods?
Skellige Armorer 01|The sea provides.
Geralt|And if it doesn't provide on its own, you hack off hands that hold swords in a death grip?
Skellige Armorer 01|Haha! D'you think we just find all this on the shore, like seashells at low tide?
Geralt|Show me what you got.
Geralt|Can you craft something for me?
Geralt|What else do you bring back from raids?
Skellige Armorer 01|Essentials, mostly - fancy wines, silks, valuables of all sorts.
Skellige Armorer 01|Oh, and wenches. If we don't make proper use of 'em, who will?
Skellige Armorer 01|Heard of Hollerin' Hulda, known as the Hellraiser, Madman Lugos' wife? Or Goldilocks Sanza, world's most beautiful maid in her time? Taken in raids, both.
Geralt|So long.
Skellige Armorer 01|Lookin' for somethin' specific?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Greetings.
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 01|What d'ye want?
Geralt|Someone's in a good mood…
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 01|What mood would you be in if you'd lost your son…? So, I'm askin' - what d'ye want?
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 01|So be it…
Geralt|Like you to craft something for me…
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 01|Fine, show me… It's easier somehow when I've work to do…
Geralt|Your son - what happened to him?
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 01|Drowned… Finback tipped the boat he was on. Were his first journey into northern waters…
Geralt|Sorry to hear it.
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 01|Sea swallowed his body… I'll not bury him, he'll not feast with his ancestors.
Geralt|Take care now.
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 01|Mhm.
Skellige Blacksmith Helper 01|Eh? What is it?
<|endoftext|>
Verden Smith 01|Trusty arms for all sorts! Steel swords and strong maces for the men folk, inlaid knuckle dusters for the lasses and ladies!
Geralt|Show me your wares.
Geralt|Like you to craft something for me.
Geralt|Master-quality weapons - you capable of making them?
Verden Smith 01|Who do you think I am, Hattori?
Geralt|Hattori?
Verden Smith 01|The master craftsman of Novigrad - why everyone's heard o' him. Says he's retired now, so no - ain't no one can do what you ask.
Geralt|We get some cards in, too, I'll be a happy man.
Geralt|Huh. So long.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Bard 01|It's you! The White Wolf! The famous Geralt of Rivia, am I right?
Geralt|You hear about me?
Novigrad Bard 01|Hear about you? Why, I know all there is to know! Learned it from Dandelion himself, who's forever telling stories of you and your adventures together.
Novigrad Bard 01|Of your hunt for the dragon, and how you outfoxed the sylvan midst the hemp, of the Battle for the Bridge, and how he saved you from bandits…
Geralt|Like to hear that one some time myself.
Novigrad Bard 01|One never tires of Dandelion's tales and ballads! Why, all will be amazed when I tell them the Wolf himself takes joy in listening to them!
Novigrad Bard 01|Now, tell me how I may be of service. Something to wet your tongue?
Geralt|What do you have to drink that's good?
Geralt|You worked here long? Earlier, I mean?
Novigrad Bard 01|Under old Mr. Wily, you mean? Why no. I answered a notice. What did it say…?
Novigrad Bard 01|"Help wanted, to assist in the oversight of an exclusive establishment with refined diversions. Baccalaureate freshly gained, ten years of tavern experience a plus, knowledge of the Common Tongue, Elder Tongue and contemporary poetry required."
Geralt|Hm, wouldn't you 'ave been better off staying at the academy, or--
Novigrad Bard 01|Bah, I never passed the entrance exam. Neither do I know a lick of Elder, though I can, indeed, play a ditty or three.
Novigrad Bard 01|Also, I've committed all Master Dandelion's works to memory.
Geralt|Ah, I see.
Geralt|Take care, now.
Novigrad Bard 01|Greetings, White Wolf! What comforts might we provide today?
<|endoftext|>
Gnome Man 02|A good one to you, young man. Hair's all a-gray, but by your face and straight back I know you to be in your youth.
Geralt|Greetings. What do you sell?
Gnome Man 02|Herbs, young lad. I've all sorts I gathered nearabout. You'd be surprised what useful plants grow by the roadside.
Geralt|Not that surprised, actually.
Gnome Man 02|Monkshood, for instance - lovely blossom, soothes aches and pains, but just a handful and you could poison a whole family. A very useful plant.
Geralt|Yeah. What else would you recommend?
Gnome Man 02|Have a look, young man. You seem learned in these matters, so I'll show you my special stock from under the counter.
Geralt|You just might have the herbs I need.
Geralt|Take care.
Gnome Man 02|Awfully kind of you to visit again. What sort of herbs do you need, young man?
Geralt|Could you trim my hair? Grown a bit wooly.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Greetings.
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|Oh, here it is, the apocalypse - a witcher's walked into my brothel!
Geralt|What's strange about that?
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|What's strange is you! Everyone knows witchers are freaks, mutants, unnatural. And this here's a decent brothel for whores with principles. Well, spit it out. Got all the same bits in your trousers like a normal lad?
Geralt|Last I checked, everything was where it should be.
Geralt|Like to spend some time alone with one of your women.
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|Course, but you'll take the one I give you. Be choosy, look over the lot, and I'll charge you more.
Geralt|Got anything to sell?
Geralt|Wouldn't mind a round or two of cards. Only need my hands for that. Got those, see?
Geralt|So long.
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|So? A bit of lust in your freakish heart after all?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Looking for some potion ingredients.
Mage 01|There's been a mistake… I'm no mage. No, no, no. I'm an apothecary.
Geralt|Mhm. Could swear I saw you at the summit in Loc Muinne.
Mage 01|That may have been my twin brother…
Geralt|Stop it. To the Eternal Fire I'm a boil to be lanced, same as you. Relax, not about to turn you in.
Mage 01|*Sigh* What do you want?
Geralt|Got anything interesting to sell?
Mage 01|I do, but shhh…
Geralt|How'd you end up here? Crematory wouldn't exactly be my first choice if I needed to hide…
Mage 01|I wound up here by accident…
Mage 01|At first, after the slaughter at Loc Muinne, I hid in the woods near Ban Glean… But how long can one survive on roots?
Mage 01|Finally, I could stand it no more and boarded a raft bound for Novigrad. Once here, my coin soon ran out. I began to beg… and thus met the King of Beggar's men.
Mage 01|They gave me a choice. I could start working for him, or they would break my legs.
Mage 01|After the Conclave's deliberations at Loc Muinne.
Geralt|What happened?
Mage 01|I moved to condemn Radovid… So Carduin called the guards. They beat me… thoroughly, with gusto.
Mage 01|Once they thought I'd expired, they sent me here… The furnace was blazing and open… I felt a wave of heat… and began to scream.
Geralt|So long.
Mage 01|If anyone asks… You've not seen me.
Mage 01|Greetings… what is it?
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Old Man 03|Greetings. What've you got to pawn, and how much d'you need?
Geralt|What makes you think I need a loan?
Novigrad Old Man 03|Tain't a man that don't, from time to time. And you don't look nor smell flush with coin.
Geralt|Just so happens I'm doing fine at the moment.
Novigrad Old Man 03|Then maybe you'd like a look at what the less fortunate have forfeited?
Geralt|Show me what you have in stock.
Geralt|Been a loan shark long?
Novigrad Old Man 03|Aye, since I was just a little tyke!
Geralt|So you helped your dad? Took it over when he died?
Novigrad Old Man 03|Nah, me own father left me here in pawn, and never did redeem me.
Geralt|What would you say to a few rounds of gwent?
Geralt|So long.
Novigrad Old Man 03|Hello there. Pawnin' or buyin'?
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Trader 01|Welcome back!
Novigrad Trader 01|So? Interested in some of Aeramas' mementos, after all? They're still for sale.
Geralt|Show me what you have.
Geralt|All right, I get it - these items aren't actually common.
Novigrad Trader 01|Rumor has it each is an enchanted key.
Geralt|Rumor happen to mention where to find the locks these keys open?
Novigrad Trader 01|Sadly, no. Why, if I knew you could hardly expect me to sell them.
Geralt|Where did Aeramas live?
Novigrad Trader 01|Had a lovely residence south of Oxenfurt. Badly damaged now, as he made the hunters pay dearly for his skin.
Geralt|To matters less controversial - wouldn't mind playing a few rounds of gwent.
Geralt|Farewell.
Novigrad Trader 01|Don't be shy, now. Looking doesn't cost a thing. There's plenty to behold: this here's a collection of wonders that belonged to the mage Aeramas! A once in a lifetime opportunity!
Geralt|How'd you get ahold of these? Never heard of a mage willingly parting with his treasures.
Novigrad Trader 01|No one asked Aeramas his will. He was burned at the stake a fortnight ago.
Geralt|Strange they didn't burn his stuff with him. Witch hunters let you resell it, just like that?
Novigrad Trader 01|Why wouldn't they…? These are common goods, some valuable only as collectibles, perhaps.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Show me what you have in stock.
Geralt|Take care.
Eternal Fire Priest 03|You again? I've changed the code word, but you're still entitled to a hefty discount.
Eternal Fire Priest 03|Do you wish the Eternal Fire's blessing upon you and your household? Come, true believer, may its light shine…
Geralt|Watch it, or you'll see the shine of my sword. And back off, that incense is making me nauseous.
Eternal Fire Priest 03|You might've said so right away. Countersign: "And fish soup gives the deacon's auntie a headache." What do you need? Before you ask - I'm all out of hemorrhoid cream.
Geralt|What're you talking about? Your incense that bad for the brain…?
Eternal Fire Priest 03|What do you mean? You gave the password, signaling you wish to buy some herbs…
Geralt|You're about as much a priest of the Eternal Fire as I am a vestal virgin. What sort of conspiracy is this?
Eternal Fire Priest 03|Conspiracy - bah! Folk see conspiracies everywhere! I sell harmless things. Yet in turbulent times like these…
Geralt|Think it's safer to don priest's robes? See, thing is, in this town impersonating a priest is likely grounds for punishment - cruel and unusual, I'd wager.
Eternal Fire Priest 03|I impersonate no one! I am a priest! Though I'm also an alchemist. Sadly, it's become difficult to reconcile the two.
Eternal Fire Priest 03|Hm - will you report me? Or shall we make a deal?
Geralt|Trying to bribe me? Save your coin - I'm not fond of priests. In fact, you'd have to pay me to talk to them.
Eternal Fire Priest 03|Then I shall sell you my wares for less. Cast your eyes, see if there's ought you could use. Provided, of course, you do not seek hemorrhoid cream.
Geralt|Don't know any password. And if I said it by accident, then you folk run a shoddy conspiracy. "That incense is making me nauseous" - brilliant…
Eternal Fire Priest 03|Argh, hope barnacles break out on your cock, you son of a leprous whore! Hope it grows wings and flies off to warmer climes come Yule!
Eternal Fire Priest 03|If you report me, you motherplougher, I'll make sure our pyres stand side by side. That way I can blow on yours, see your arse roast before I go.
Geralt|Curse a lot better than you bless. Actually starting to like you, herbalist. Relax, won't turn you in.
Eternal Fire Priest 03|In that case, perhaps we can trade? I've many interesting substances…
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Trader 03|Excellent goods at the lowest prices! If some mug's got it cheaper, you can be sure the scoundrel puts sawdust in his flour!
Novigrad Trader 03|Interest you in a fritter?
Geralt|Mind if I have a look?
Geralt|Not so interested in goods, but I'd sure like to play some cards…
Geralt|Take care, now.
Novigrad Trader 03|Greetings.
Novigrad Trader 03|Ah… Sir Bleeding Heart, here to pay me a visit. Good day.
Geralt|We know each other?
Novigrad Trader 03|No, thank the gods. Though we might've met had you helped me. But no, chose to wash your hands of the matter, abandoned me to thugs who assaulted me in a passageway.
Novigrad Trader 03|Begone, already.
Novigrad Trader 03|I welcome my savior to my humble abode!
Geralt|Huh?
Novigrad Trader 03|You may not remember, sir, but I shall never forget. Two cutpurses tried to rob me, you stood in my defense.
Geralt|Uh… That's right. Just gave them what they deserved.
Novigrad Trader 03|And earned yourself a standing reduction in my shop.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Actually, I'd just like to buy something.
Geralt|I'd love to meet the rising generation of Passiflora buds.
Geralt|Any girl in particular you'd recommend?
Marquise Serenity|You'd like Narcissa. Perhaps not the prettiest, but she's by far the most inventive. And as my dearly departed mother would say: the fun's not in the face.
Geralt|Take care, now.
Marquise Serenity|Could it be that all roads lead to the Passiflora? Welcome back!
Marquise Serenity|Mmmm. When I look at you… why, I almost regret I'm no longer on active duty.
Marquise Serenity|White Wolf! Welcome to the Passiflora! Oh - no sign of recognition in your eyes.
Geralt|Greetings, uh…
Marquise Serenity|Don't fret, I'm sure I look quite different from when we last saw each other.
Geralt|Er… which was…?
Marquise Serenity|Oh, eons ago. You and Master Dandelion appeared, two halflings in tow. What a smash they were, the little chaps. We recount that night to this day.
Geralt|So the, uh… staff hasn't changed since then?
Marquise Serenity|Oh, of course it has! It does so incessantly in this business. Burly Berthie married a merchant, Ella struck out on her own, and you'll likely find Cerise praying at the Temple. I, alone, remain.
Marquise Serenity|So? Shall I summon the girls? Just remember - this is a decent establishment. Paws to yourself, to start with. And our girls are well-mannered. The range of subjects they discuss in detail - I myself find it daunting.
Geralt|Yeah, sorry, but I'm here to…
Marquise Serenity|Speak softly. I know very well why you're here.
Marquise Serenity|They await. This way, please.
Marquise Serenity|Geralt, greetings! Come now, darling, don't be shy!
Marquise Serenity|Geralt, greetings! Come now, darling, don't be shy!
Geralt|Yeah, sorry, but I'm here to…
Marquise Serenity|Speak softly. I know very well why you're here.
Marquise Serenity|They await. This way, please.
Marquise Serenity|Geralt, greetings! Come now, darling, don't be shy!
Geralt|Yeah, sorry, but I'm here to…
Marquise Serenity|Speak softly. I know very well why you're here.
Marquise Serenity|They await. This way, please.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Just show me what you got.
Geralt|Willing to craft something for me?
Geralt|So long.
Redanian Blacksmith 01|Piss off.
Geralt|I wanted to--
Redanian Blacksmith 01|I know what you want. To buy somethin'. Or maybe sell.
Redanian Blacksmith 01|But let's get one thing straight. You'd not get shit from me had Roche not ordered me to trade with you. My supplies are for the army, not for stray mutts.
Redanian Blacksmith 01|So I'll show you my wares, 'cause those're my orders. But then get the fuck outta here fast as those freaky legs'll carry you. And I'd appreciate you not coming back.
Redanian Blacksmith 01|You again.
<|endoftext|>
Verden Smith 01|Lookin' for the best smith in Oreton? Well, you've found him.
Geralt|Lemme see what you're offering.
Geralt|Need something crafted. Can you take a look?
Geralt|Any other smiths in Oreton or nearby?
Verden Smith 01|Not anymore.
Geralt|Smithing - pretty tiring job… Need a break, maybe, relax a bit? Play a game or two of gwent?
Verden Smith 01|Hm, why not.
Geralt|So long.
Verden Smith 01|Yeah?
<|endoftext|>
Scoiatael Man 02|Greetings, Gwynbleidd. Would you like to trade?
Geralt|Be glad to glance at what you're selling.
Geralt|You know me? Where from?
Scoiatael Man 02|We met long ago, in Brokilon.
Geralt|Possible, but can't say I remember.
Scoiatael Man 02|No surprise - you were badly wounded then. If not for the dryads' care, it's unlikely you would have survived.
Geralt|Long time ago… So long it feels like it happened in another life. Maybe that's not so far from the truth…
Geralt|Va fail.
Scoiatael Man 02|It's you! I'll never forget you. I must thank you once more!
<|endoftext|>
Gnome Man 01|Greetings! Is it herbs you seek? Medicines to mute a bashful maid's inhibitions, or a concoction to raise your own courage for a second go?
Geralt|That it? No other weeds or brews?
Gnome Man 01|Aye - one to make your hair grow, another to do the opposite. An easer of pain, a calmer of heartburn… Tell me what ails you.
Geralt|Let me have a look.
Geralt|Know any advanced formulae, maybe something you could teach me?
Gnome Man 01|All I know I learned from Master Gremist of Skellige. Lookin' to apprentice yourself in the herbalist trade?
Geralt|No, just wanna learn something new.
Gnome Man 01|Call it what you will. You must sail 'cross the Great Sea, find the isle of Ard Skellig. There, in the Sacred Grove, the learned Master Gremist will judge whether you're fit to be his pupil.
Geralt|So long.
<|endoftext|>
Gnome Man 01|Greetings! Is it herbs you seek? Medicines to mute a bashful maid's inhibitions? Or a concoction to raise your own courage for a second go?
Geralt|That it? No other weeds or brews?
Gnome Man 01|Aye. One to make your hair grow, another to do the opposite. An easer of pain, a calmer of heartburn. Tell me what ails you.
Geralt|Wouldn't happen to have some yarrow extract?
Gnome Man 01|I do. In the back. Follow me, please.
Geralt|Let me have a look.
Geralt|Know any advanced formulae, maybe something you could teach me?
Gnome Man 01|All I know I learned from Master Gremist of Skellige. Lookin' to apprentice yourself in the herbalist trade?
Geralt|Nah, just wanna learn something new.
Gnome Man 01|Call it what you will. You must sail 'cross the Great Sea, find the isle of Ard Skellig. There, in the Sacred Grove, the learned Master Gremist will judge whether you're fit to be his pupil.
Geralt|Yearning to play a few rounds of gwent. That oughta set me straight.
Geralt|So long.
Geralt|Hey there.
Gnome Man 01|Huh. That was rather efficient.
Geralt|That all you got to say? I saved your life.
Gnome Man 01|Pff. We'd have disposed of that rabble easily.
Geralt|"We?"
Gnome Man 01|My, aren't we precise? You know what I mean! Are you here to trade or not? Hm?
<|endoftext|>
Redanian Armorer 01|Greetings! My, my - a witcher! Somethin' tells me I'll finally get somethin' interestin' to do!
Geralt|Sure doesn't look like you're short on work.
Redanian Armorer 01|Oh, this! A Redanian army order, but there's no pleasure in it - one after the other, same thing time and again. No finesse required!
Geralt|Lookin' to perfect your craft?
Redanian Armorer 01|Of course! Craftin's like ploughin' a maid: fall into a rut, and, sure, you'll get the job done, but there'll be no whoops, no hollers, no standing ovation. So, got any special requests for me, help me stay on form?
Geralt|Still talking about armor, aren't we?
Redanian Armorer 01|Aye, what else would it be?
Geralt|Show me what you have in stock.
Geralt|You're in luck - actually do have a special order for you.
Redanian Armorer 01|That's fantastic! Mark my words, you'll be satisfied!
Geralt|So long.
Redanian Armorer 01|Greetings again! So, you got a job for me, an interesting one?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Got those, uh, substances you wanted.
Keira Metz|Splendid. I can finally begin my study of double arboreal racination patterns. But first I'll--
Geralt|Brew yourself a mug of mulled wine?
Geralt|Saw what the wagon was carrying. Exquisite meats, expensive wines, Zerrikanian spices… tsk - not a speck of magic.
Geralt|Care to tell me what you're up to?
Keira Metz|I would rather show you. But you must wait a bit.
Geralt|Color me intrigued. Fine, I'll wait.
Keira Metz|Then shoo - outside!
Geralt|Gonna slip into something more comfortable?
Keira Metz|Later… Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Well, go on - out.
Geralt|Maybe another time…
Keira Metz|I don't like men who turn me down.
Geralt|And I don't like surprises. Especially ones that sorceresses spring on me.
Keira Metz|I daresay this one, once sprung, would thrill you… Ah well, change your mind - come and see me.
Geralt|You were gonna show me something…
Keira Metz|Yes. But you weren't interested.
Geralt|Changed my mind.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Leftovers, cuts of meat… catoblepas? Wonder what spell requires that.
Geralt|A dry red from Zubarran. Southern slope, notes of... blackcurrant and citrus.
Geralt|Ugh, pains the heart…
Geralt|Pepper, cinnamon, cloves. Spices both rare and expensive… Not terribly magical, though.
Geralt|Human. From an artery.
Geralt|Can't be far. Wouldn't have made it.
Geralt|Drowners and a water hag. My favorites.
Geralt|Package still intact. Don't sense anything magic, though… Wonder how Keira'll explain this one.
Geralt|Hid and waited for help.
Geralt|It never came. That's Velen for you.
<|endoftext|>
Keira Metz|You've been patient - thank you. It's almost ready…
Geralt|Huh? If I wanted to see white mice, I'd just get drunk.
Keira Metz|Note that I said "almost." Now don't interrupt.
Keira Metz|Byc'hane, gvyn, caeffyl!
Geralt|Third mouse - what happened to it?
Keira Metz|The spell has a sixty-six point six seven percent chance of success… I always use one more than I need. Just in case.
Geralt|So where'd it-- Keira, gonna explain what's going on here?
Keira Metz|Know the fairytale about Cinderella?
Geralt|Mhm. True story it's based on, too. A zeugl cropped up in a palace pond and ate Princess Cendrilla whole. Left behind one slipper, so…
Keira Metz|I beg you, not another word about zeugls.
Keira Metz|Now, to return to the fairytale… I'd like to escape these ghastly swamps for one magical night. I don't need a fairy godmother, I'll cast the spells myself.
Keira Metz|But I could use a prince charming… It just so happens you're the only decent candidate in all Velen. So, what do you say to a moonlight ride on horseback… and dinner?
Geralt|Sounds tempting. So tempting I don't think I can refuse.
Keira Metz|Before we go… there's one more thing.
Geralt|Gotta transform a pumpkin into a carriage?
Keira Metz|No. I shall transform our rancid rags into something more glamorous.
Keira Metz|Don't wince. It will only be an illusion, won't hurt a bit. And at dawn everything will return to normal.
Geralt|Why not. Might as well go all out.
Keira Metz|Then hold on tight.
Keira Metz|Gvella, glan!
Keira Metz|So, what do you think? Neckline too modest?
Geralt|It's just right.
Keira Metz|I might've also changed your hair color while I was at it… I've always fancied dark-haired men. Oh well. Any port in a storm.
Keira Metz|Well, off we go. Dinner's waiting…
Keira Metz|Last one there does the dishes!
Geralt|No way. Don't like having spells cast on me… Besides, my clothes aren't rancid.
Keira Metz|Debatable… But let's not argue and ruin the mood.
Geralt|I'm a witcher, not a gigolo.
Keira Metz|Don't flatter yourself. I don't want to shag you in the bushes, but to share a pleasant evening. But if no… Then no.
Geralt|Ooh, all right. I'll do it.
Keira Metz|I feel honored, truly.
Geralt|You're gonna have to conjure up your prince, too. Heard frogs are great for that.
Keira Metz|You heard wrong. It's princes who get turned into frogs… It could happen to a witcher just as easily, so get out of my sight.
Geralt|Changed mice into horses - third level transfiguration. I'm impressed.
Geralt|But I still don't get it.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Your fairytale, your rules.
Keira Metz|Really? Then close your eyes… and count to ten.
Geralt|One… Two… Three… Four…
Geralt|All right, that's enough.
Geralt|Sorry. Just not in the mood.
Keira Metz|Is it a headache? Or does the problem lie elsewhere in your anatomy?
Keira Metz|Ugh. I knew we shouldn't have had that wine before dinner…
Keira Metz|Will you at least lie down and gaze at the stars with me?
Geralt|Hmm… Why not.
Keira Metz|Know what they call that constellation in Zerrikania?
Geralt|Dragon something, I bet.
Keira Metz|No, it has a different name… A bit indecent, actually. Lean closer and I'll whisper it in your ear.
Keira Metz|Egvane navr.
Geralt|Sorry… There's someone else.
Keira Metz|So what?
Keira Metz|Oh, Geralt, Geralt. You're so old-fashioned.
Keira Metz|Congratulations. You'd make an excellent jockey.
Geralt|If I were only a foot shorter and five stone lighter.
Keira Metz|Well, yes… but then I'd not have invited you here.
Keira Metz|Now do you see why I needed those… substances?
Geralt|Beef in cinnamon and cloves, roasted capon with shallots… It was worth the trouble.
Keira Metz|Shall I pour the white or the--?
Geralt|Dry red. But let it breathe a little first.
Keira Metz|Well, well… never took you for a wine connoisseur.
Geralt|Think witchers suck the marrow out of drowner bones and wash it down with puddle water?
Keira Metz|More or less. Well, we've chatted long enough on empty stomachs. Let's dig in.
Geralt|Must've cost you a small fortune. Sure you don't need me to pitch in?
Keira Metz|Please, I manage. You know, a dozen eggs here, a cock or gander there… Besides, my finances are about to improve.
Geralt|How - if you don't mind my asking? I mean, you'd think the only work to be had in Velen would be in farming.
Keira Metz|Hah. Very true. So, I've two options. I can either start cultivating turnips or... leave.
Keira Metz|But that's not what I wished to discuss. Thank you once again, Geralt, for your help with the tower. You were fabulous.
Geralt|Not the first curse I've lifted.
Keira Metz|But among the most difficult, correct? What happened on that island… Why, I shiver at the thought.
Keira Metz|And the laboratory… I sincerely hope you burned everything - the cages, the corpses, the papers…
Geralt|Didn't destroy that workshop, if that's what you're asking. Didn't see any reason to.
Keira Metz|If Alexander's findings were to fall into the wrong hands…
Keira Metz|Although… Fyke Isle has a terrible reputation. None even dare go there. Perhaps there's nothing to worry about.
Keira Metz|Ugh, I'm sorry. Such a gloomy subject to broach… I simply shouldn't have - not during our romantic dinner.
Geralt|Romantic? Thought we came here as friends.
Keira Metz|Friends… with benefits.
Keira Metz|So?
Geralt|Ugh, why are you even interested?
Keira Metz|Because I grasp the importance of the studies conducted there. In the wrong hands, the findings could do immense harm.
Geralt|All right, let's get down to business.
Keira Metz|What are you talking about?
Geralt|Sex. That's why we're here, isn't?
Keira Metz|Ah! You may know about wine… but you remain quite unsophisticated otherwise.
Keira Metz|That's very good. Because boors are better in bed.
Keira Metz|Now close your eyes… and count to ten.
Geralt|All right, I'm curious. We celebrating something?
Keira Metz|Yes. A return to the living.
Geralt|Could've just told me what this was about right o--
Keira Metz|Ugh. "Geralt, run to the woods and fetch my shopping. I'd like to make dinner." Well, would you have helped?
Geralt|If I'd known I'd get a glass of Zubarran dry in return? Of course.
Keira Metz|I thought you a better horseman.
Geralt|For the record, I was riding a mouse.
Keira Metz|For someone who usually trots around on a Roach, that shouldn't present a challenge…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Must be the manor the old woman mentioned…
Geralt|Dammit, barred from the inside. Gotta be another way in…
Geralt|Hmm… Look like twins.
Geralt|Old woman's brother, must be.
Geralt|Akh akh… No one's been here in a long time.
Geralt|Strange… wall looks like it was put up later than the others.
Geralt|Skeleton in the closet. Happens in the best families.
Geralt|A man… in his thirties, forties, maybe.
Geralt|…"and thus I die, in darkness, of hunger and thirst… Gods, have mercy…"
Geralt|Hm, something here. A chest…
Geralt|Shit, won't open. Need a key.
Geralt|A journal… A little wear and tear.
Geralt|Couple of pages missing, torn out…
Geralt|Hm. The pages missing from the journal?
Geralt|"Dolores."
Geralt|Lock's damaged. Won't get in there.
Geralt|Somebody lived here once.
Geralt|Wonder what door this opens…
Geralt|Hmmm… Maybe this'll open the barn door…
Geralt|Hmm… Manor's got a few new tenants.
Geralt|Hm… Not a single sign of monsters. Locals're either imagining things, or someone's scared them off.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Rustling's coming from the barn.
Geralt|Traps everywhere. Gotta be careful.
Geralt|One less to worry about.
Geralt|Akh akh. Gas of some sort…
Geralt|Hole in the wall. Gotta get in there.
Geralt|Shit!
Geralt|Hmm... a sort of attic… Gotta get up there somehow…
Geralt|A ladder…
Geralt|Might be just long enough to reach that upper level…
Geralt|Hmm… A trip wire.
Geralt|Problem solved.
Geralt|Whoever set this knew what they were doing.
Geralt|Lost him…
Geralt|Never known a monster to set a trap. Someone's here.
Geralt|Dammit! It's gonna explode!
Geralt|Well, well. A spiked pit. Took a lot of digging. Should stay clear of that.
Geralt|Booby trap… Whoever set it knew what they were doing…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What was that about?
Verden Old Woman 02|What's become of me in me elder years? Refused a roof over me head by a common churl!
Verden Old Woman 02|I was born a noble's daughter… My brother and I - we managed the manor for years.
Geralt|What happened to him?
Verden Old Woman 02|A caller came one day, a drifter, a hunter… Ehh, it wasn't long before we fell in love and wed.
Verden Old Woman 02|We prepared to leave the manor. My brother, he took offense, refused to bid me farewell.
Verden Old Woman 02|Years on I returned, but found no sign of him. Folk claimed monsters had infested our home, come to nest there.
Geralt|I could take care of those monsters for you.
Verden Old Woman 02|Hmm… You're a witcher, right? No ordinary man would be so eager.
Verden Old Woman 02|Don't fret - it's all the same to me, provided you're honest.
Verden Old Woman 02|The house, it's east of here. Take this key. Once you've driven off the beasts, look for a chest. My treasure, savings, really. They're yours.
Geralt|What'll that leave you with?
Verden Old Woman 02|A roof over my head is all I need. And if it comes to it, I've other heirlooms to sell.
Verden Old Woman 02|But I know you witchers don't work for free. I could never let you go without honest pay. Gods keep you.
Geralt|Think I've been there. Don't need to worry about monsters anymore.
Verden Old Woman 02|I thank you. You don't know how much this means to me. I haven't the coin to reward you, but…
Verden Old Woman 02|Here, take this. It opens a chest. What's there is yours.
Geralt|Also found a corpse - a man bricked up in a wall. Had these on him…
Verden Old Woman 02|Humbert…
Verden Old Woman 02|My brother, I thought he resented my choice, I thought he'd abandoned me… Yet it seems my husband killed him.
Verden Old Woman 02|Ehh, the truth is oft painful, but I thank you for revealing it. For this, and for driving off the beasts, I owe you a reward, but…
Geralt|It's all right. Found the chest, too. But what'll you be left with?
Geralt|My sympathies. So long.
Geralt|Here about the notice.
Verden Old Woman 02|And I thought none would come. Well, I'd a grange, a manor. Belonged to my family… myself and my brother - all gone now…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Got some hard news too, though. Found your brother's corpse, bricked up in a wall. And this.
Verden Old Woman 02|So… Roderick… my husband, he killed him. Gods!
Geralt|Sorry.
Verden Old Woman 02|The truth can be cruel… But, ah... one can't turn back time.
Verden Old Woman 02|And… perchance did you find my chest… with my treasures?
Geralt|No. Could be someone stole it.
Verden Old Woman 02|Perhaps… So many years have passed… But go back and search carefully. I've naught else to offer you.
Geralt|I'll do that.
Geralt|Time I was on my way.
Verden Old Woman 02|Gods guide you.
Geralt|Yeah. Pretty generous as rewards go.
Verden Old Woman 02|You've earned every last bit.
Verden Old Woman 02|You've returned. What's become of my home?
Geralt|Nothing just yet, gran. Be back soon… with something.
Geralt|It's safe now.
Verden Old Woman 02|I thank you. This means so much…
Geralt|So long.
<|endoftext|>
Verden Old Woman 02|For what you did, I must thank you again.
Verden Old Woman 02|I promised you a reward. Do you remember? It remains in the barn, in the chest.
Verden Old Woman 02|I must find this spot… I must bid Humbert farewell.
Geralt|Managing all right? Hope there wasn't too much monster damage.
Verden Old Woman 02|A bit… Though time, I think, was the greater culprit.
Verden Old Woman 02|But I don't let it worry me. I spent my youth in this house. Restoring its splendor will be a pleasure, not a burden.
Geralt|Hope this proves a peaceful home. Farewell.
Verden Old Woman 02|Farewell, witcher. And do take care of yourself.
Geralt|Greetings.
Verden Old Woman 02|Ah, such a kind guest! So glad to see you, witcher, welcome.
Verden Old Woman 02|Humbert, poor Humbert... Roderick, how could you…?
<|endoftext|>
Letho|Emperor just decided to get rid of me - I'm an inconvenient witness, after all. I've run into loads of men out to kill me ever since I left Loc Muinne.
Geralt|Now I understand all the traps.
Letho|Gotten real careful.
Geralt|For good reason.
Geralt|Took a job from an old woman. Supposed to get rid of the monsters here.
Letho|Did that already. Count on you remembering that when you collect your pay.
Geralt|Hiding in a place overrun by monsters - good idea.
Letho|Means people don't wander in by accident. And the ones who come on purpose, well, I'm prepared for them.
Geralt|Assassins?
Geralt|Who'd you piss off this time?
Geralt|Letho?!
Letho|Yeah, didn't expect to see you, either. You one of them?
Geralt|Who's "them"?
Letho|To the emperor - mercenaries. To themselves - bounty hunters. To me - ordinary sons of bitches.
Geralt|Well, got nothing to fear from me.
Geralt|Came here by accident, actually.
Letho|Accidents sure send you to strange places. Till recently this place was full of ghouls.
Geralt|"Them"? You know I work alone. Question is, what're you doing here?
Letho|Waiting for them. The ones trying to kill me.
Letho|Bravo, Geralt. Avoided all my traps.
Letho|Your reflexes have slowed. Hope you're not hurt. Those were my traps.
Letho|Elephant in a china shop, I swear. Set off almost all my traps.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Don't look a bit like lost travelers.
Letho|They're not. Means Louis sold me out.
Geralt|Louis?
Letho|Old friend, kinda. Did a few jobs together once, a while past. Louis recommended this place to me.
Geralt|You've grown careless. Let yourself be drawn into a trap.
Letho|Nah. Only traps here are the ones I set.
Letho|Gotta get rid of them. Coming?
Geralt|Lead the way.
Geralt|We got a plan of attack?
Letho|Yeah. Improvise.
Geralt|This is between you and them. Not my problem, rather not get involved.
Letho|You got involved when you came here. We'll get rid of them quicker together.
Geralt|Hrgh. Knew I shouldn't have come here…
Geralt|So maybe those men down below wound up here by accident.
Letho|Eat my own boot before I believe that.
<|endoftext|>
Letho|Goddamn fools.
Geralt|Shoddily armed for assassins.
Letho|These're just scouts. Came to see if Louis was telling the truth. Rest must be waiting nearby.
Geralt|And your old pal probably knows where.
Letho|He was the only one knew I'd be here. Must've told them. Think me and him are due for a little chat…
Geralt|Hmm, could be interesting. Love to see it.
Letho|Come along. Sight of two witchers should loosen his tongue that much quicker.
Letho|Stay close to me. It's one of those places that's hard to find if you don't know where to look.
Geralt|In that case - good luck.
Letho|Wanna come with? Sight of two witchers might loosen his tongue quicker.
Letho|Besides, we haven't seen each other in ages. You could tell me what's new in the world…
Geralt|Put it that way… All right, I'd love to come.
Geralt|Maybe next time, Letho. Got something else to take care of now.
Letho|Sure. So long, Wolf. Nice seeing you.
Geralt|Same. Don't get killed.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|This Louis - somehow doubt he's one of your best friends.
Letho|You know how it is in this trade.
Letho|Drink with someone in the evening, check if he's robbed you in the morning.
Geralt|How'd you meet?
Letho|Was before Foltest kissed this world goodbye.
Letho|Louis was a wanted man in Aedirn.
Letho|Hefty bounty on his head, and normal contracts were hard to come by. So I decided to catch the bastard, make some coin.
Letho|Tracking him down proved easier than killing a drowner. He was, uh, merrymaking at the Golden Hanged Man, smack in the middle of Hagge.
Letho|Nabbed him, tied him up, but the guard post didn't open till dawn… so we had a few hours.
Letho|Started talking, killing time. Chat was so nice that once dawn came I let him go.
Geralt|And that's why you trusted him…? Felt he owed you one?
Letho|I was stupid. Stupidity can cost you. But betrayal costs even more.
Letho|Stick closer, Geralt!
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|Leeethooo, greetings! Good to see you alive and well.
Letho|Oh yeah?
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|Course! We're old mates, ain't we…? Who's your friend?
Geralt|Geralt of Rivia. Witcher.
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|Another one? What's this - prime contract available in the area?
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|Sit down, care for a drink?
Letho|I don't drink with traitors and rats.
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|Who-ho! Let's be civil, now. Remember, you're on my turf.
Letho|Arnout Vester's men showed up at the manor. You were the only one knew I was there.
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|They'd been nippin' at your heels for a while - said so yourself. Perhaps they finally caught a whiff.
Letho|Mhm. With your help.
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|You've not been here five minutes and already you've offended me twice.
Letho|No insult worthy of scum like you.
Geralt|Doesn't matter. And don't change the subject.
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|Subject? What subject? You just arrived.
Geralt|A new mate. Who knows you're a fink.
<|endoftext|>
Letho|Lie still or you'll bleed to death.
Letho|Tell me where Vester's men are. I'll give you something to stanch the bleeding.
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|Th-they're north of here. In Lindenvale.
Geralt|Don't believe you, somehow.
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|Why would I lie?
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|Letho, you gotta forgive me. It weren't nothin' personal.
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|Things… Things been shite of late… And we fell afoul o' the Black Ones…
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|Vester showed up one day. Offered half of the bounty on your head and a letter of absolution from the emperor.
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|You gotta understand - you don't say no to an offer like that.
Letho|I understand.
Novigrad Thug Strong 03|Hey! My medicine!
Letho|Gotta understand, Louis. You don't betray men like me.
Letho|Time to see Vester.
Geralt|Going with you.
Geralt|I'm curious - how much does the life of an "old mate" get you these days?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Arnout Vester… Nilfgaardian name.
Letho|From Metinna, I think. But he's hunted and killed everywhere from the far south to the Dragon Mountains.
Geralt|Why have I never heard of him?
Letho|Goon goes by different names - Brenden Vilfe, Appo Saxon, Manfred Whimplebottoms…
Geralt|Manfred Whimplebottoms? Good name for a clown.
Letho|Ones he's done in sure weren't laughing.
Letho|Preferred method - rip the teeth out, one by one, then cut the mouth open ear to ear.
Letho|It's how they punish deadbeat debtors in the Nilfgaardian underworld.
Geralt|Quite the career. Underworld to serving the emperor and his court.
Letho|Yeah… Scum does usually float to the top.
Letho|Don't have to come with me, you know.
Letho|I can handle a few thugs.
Geralt|I'm here, figured I might as well… Never know, could prove useful.
Geralt|Besides, kinda wanna see this how this plays out.
<|endoftext|>
Letho|What's in the barn?
Verden Boy 03|H-h-hay.
Letho|Got company?
Letho|Run and find your parents. Tell them to grab whatever's valuable, take you and flee. Got it?
Letho|Good. Give this to your mother. Now run.
Geralt|What was that?
Letho|Compensation.
Letho|Stay here. And don't interfere - no matter what happens.
Letho|Plug your ears.
Verden Bandit 02|What the blazes?
Verden Bandit 03|A bolt o' lightnin' or somethin'?
Nilfgaardian Soldier 03|Shut up, all of you!
Nilfgaardian Soldier 03|Letho of Gulet… Good to see you alive and well.
Letho|Funny. Second time today I've heard that lie.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 03|It is no lie. You will certainly fetch a higher bounty alive.
Letho|Really. How much?
Nilfgaardian Soldier 03|Enough to buy me an estate in Kovir, where I will lie about eating fruit till the end of my days.
Letho|Not bad. Not every man gets to know the price on his head.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 03|Most men would prefer not to have one.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 03|But why have you come? To make my life easier?
Letho|We were passing by… Decided it was time to finally meet the famous Arnout Vester in person.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 03|I am flattered. Shame we'll not get to know one another better.
Letho|Why? Going somewhere?
Nilfgaardian Soldier 03|No. Simply because I will kill you in a moment.
Letho|Wanna kill me, but you don't even know me. Not nice. Think I have to punish you for that.
Letho|But I won't kill you. I'll just cut off your hands.
Letho|Cut off all your hands. One man after the other.
Letho|Till the end of your days, those stumps'll remind you of the mistake you made.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 03|Bloody hell! You fucking dimwit! I hadn't time to exchange two words with the man!
Verden Bandit 05|He provoked me!
Nilfgaardian Soldier 03|We have no quarrel with you, but one false move and--
Geralt|And what?
Nilfgaardian Soldier 03|You will end like him. What say you to that?
Geralt|What do I say? Simple - you're good as dead.
Geralt|You go your way, I'll go mine.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 03|Wise choice.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 03|Take his head. And we leave this gods forsaken place.
Geralt|His head stays where it is. Instead, I'll take yours.
Geralt|You're not taking anything. Need proof? Take his medallion.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 03|We will take his head. You are one, we are three.
Geralt|Mhm, but in the time it took me to run up, Letho dropped six of yours, with a bolt in his chest. How long'll it take me to kill you, whaddaya think?
Nilfgaardian Soldier 03|Ben, take the medallion. The head could rot before we arrived at our destination.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 03|Saddle the horses! We ride!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Mff-mff. Hm, Zanguebarian venom. Something's fishy…
Letho|Akh akh akh… You still here?
Geralt|Huh. They'd 'ave cut your head off if I hadn't been here.
Letho|Hm, so you proved useful after all.
Geralt|Coulda told me.
Letho|Heh, no fun in that.
Geralt|Find this amusing?
Letho|Not so loud, Geralt. I just rose from the dead.
Geralt|Zanguebarian venom could still kill you, you know.
Geralt|Got the antidote?
Letho|Mm, saddlebag. Take it in a minute. Couple of days, I'll be like new.
Geralt|What was it for? That whole farce.
Letho|Told you, I'd been on the run since Loc Muinne. Loads of pursuers… Got ambushed once, almost died.
Letho|So I decided it was time to end it. Once and for all.
Letho|Found Vester's gang and paid off his arbalist. You just witnessed the rest of the story.
Geralt|What if he'd crossed you? Like Louis?
Letho|I had to risk it.
Letho|If you hadn't cut down every last witness, I'd be a free man. Letho of Gulet is dead - word of that woulda spread across the Continent in days.
Geralt|Wouldn't 'ave done it if you'd let me in on your plan.
Letho|Told you not to get involved.
Letho|Well, my plans in shambles. I should really disappear.
Geralt|Hmm… You could wait things out at Kaer Morhen.
Letho|With your friends from the School of the Wolf? Hah. No, thanks, could end badly.
Geralt|Tell 'em I sent you. They'll understand, give you space.
Letho|Kaer Morhen, you say… Hmm, why not? Got some loose ends to tie up, but then I'll head there.
Geralt|Help you somehow? Need anything?
Letho|No, thanks. I'll be fine.
Geralt|So, see you at Kaer Morhen.
Letho|See you, Wolf.
Geralt|Gotta be a cozy haunted house nearby. You can lay low, and no one'll bother you.
Letho|Nah, had it with these swamps. Need a change of scenery. Zerrikania, maybe?
Geralt|I've heard they have striped horses there.
Letho|So have I. And apparently it's a matriarchy. I mean, been a deep belief of mine always that it's women who should rule the world. Heh.
Letho|Thanks for your help, Geralt.
Geralt|Don't mention it. See you on the Path, Letho.
Letho|Gotta say it's paid off. Letho of Gulet's dead as a doornail - word of that'll spread like wildfire, far and wide.
Letho|All I gotta do now's disappear.
Geralt|What about Louis? Was he part of this plan?
Letho|Nah, a minor complication. Ah-ahh, though his betrayal, it did get me thinking. But I had to risk it.
Geralt|You all right? You're conscious, but the Zanguebarian venom could still kill you.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Looking for a hunter named Niellen.
Verden Scavenger 01|Found him. What do you want?
Geralt|Here about your notice. I'm a witcher. When'd you last see your wife?
Verden Scavenger 01|Five days past, 'fore dawn. Were on my way out to hunt, she were asleep. I come back, found no sign of her…
Geralt|Maybe she went to the neighboring village, forgot to tell you?
Verden Woman 01|No, my sister were never gone this long before.
Geralt|Tried looking for her?
Verden Woman 01|Asked round the village, none saw 'er go. She must've left when they were still sleepin'…
Verden Woman 01|Told her time and again not to wander off on her own. She never listened.
Verden Scavenger 01|I mustered some men folk to scour the woods. Nothin'.
Geralt|I'll look in the woods, you might've missed something.
Geralt|Ask around, too. She have any friends?
Verden Woman 01|Hanna kept - keeps - to herself mostly. Watches the blacksmith's young 'uns atimes. And in the village, Glenna, the butcher's wife - she likes her best.
Geralt|Thanks. I'll try to find her… but no promises.
Geralt|You have my sympathies. Farewell.
Geralt|Notice anything strange? Maybe her behavior?
Verden Scavenger 01|No, she were her happy, smilin' self. Nothin' different of late… She's not run off, if that's what you're askin'.
Geralt|Farewell.
Geralt|Me again. Here about your wife…
Geralt|Sorry to have to tell you - your wife's dead. Went too deep into the woods, wild animals got her.
Verden Scavenger 01|Folk said that's what happened, but… I dared to hope.
Geralt|I'm sorry.
Verden Scavenger 01|I thank you anyway… Least… now I know her fate.
Verden Scavenger 01|Your pay.
Geralt|Thank you. And… take care. It gets easier.
Geralt|Keep it. News I brought you isn't worth your coin.
Verden Scavenger 01|Thank you, witcher. You're an honest man.
<|endoftext|>
Verden Woman 01|Witcher?
Geralt|What're you doing here? Shouldn't be in the forest alone.
Verden Woman 01|I came to tell you… You needn't look for Hanna. She'd 'ave returned long past were she alive.
Verden Woman 01|I'll pay you twice Niellen's pledge - just tell the man his Hanna's dead.
Geralt|Don't wanna know what happened to her?
Verden Woman 01|I've no illusions, witcher. In Velen, you're gone as long as she's been, you don't come back.
Verden Woman 01|Hanna's dead for certain. Niellen ought to accept his loss, move on with his life.
Geralt|Hmm… You could be right.
Verden Woman 01|Thank you. My sister, she'd appreciate you givin' her man the chance to start anew.
Geralt|Sorry. Not in the habit of leaving jobs undone.
Verden Woman 01|Folk speak true about you witchers - you're heartless beasts.
Geralt|Strange… People'd usually prefer to know the fate of their loved ones, whatever the cost.
Verden Woman 01|What good will it do? I'll not get my sister back, and Niellen's all I got left.
Verden Woman 01|I can't lose him, too. And, well, he'll not rest till he avenges his Hanna, even if it eats up his life.
Verden Woman 01|The man deserves better.
<|endoftext|>
Verden Woman 01|It's Niellen!
Geralt|Lycanthropy can afflict anyone. But it is a curse, so sorry, but I have to--
Verden Woman 01|You don't understand! I love him! He was near to bein' mine, till you came along! Go away, leave us be!
Geralt|What is this nonsense?
Verden Woman 01|I love him, always have. Even after I'd learned his secret.
Verden Scavenger 01|You… you knew? Did you know I shut meself in here to wait out me change?
Verden Woman 01|I knew and I didn't mind. But you chose Hanna.
Verden Woman 01|I wanted her to see you. I wanted her to fear you. She'd not have stayed. And we could be together…
Verden Scavenger 01|You brought her here… that night. 'Twas the reason I had the taste of blood in me mouth come morn.
Verden Woman 01|I did it for us! She was to see you turn, naught more! I didn't want her death, you've got to believe me!
Verden Scavenger 01|I don't. And I'll kill you willingly. First time for that, in fact.
Geralt|You won't kill anyone. Ever again.
Verden Scavenger 01|Ggggrrr!
Verden Woman 01|No! Don't hurt him!
Geralt|Get out of here. Before I change my mind.
Geralt|Run!
Geralt|This is between the two of you. I refuse to meddle. But cross my path again, and I will kill you.
Verden Woman 01|Nooo! Mercy!
Verden Scavenger 01|You had no mercy for your sister. I'll have none for you. Aaarrrggghh!
Geralt|Told you I'd kill you.
Verden Scavenger 01|I knows well what you said. Do it.
Geralt|If you want death, find some reins and a tree with a strong limb.
Verden Scavenger 01|Wouldn't work. Couldn't do it. Always been a coward. Do it, please.
Geralt|Not till I find out what's going on here.
Geralt|You insane?! Stand back! He's dangerous!
Verden Woman 01|Not to me, he's not.
Geralt|Think we need to talk…
Verden Woman 01|Nooo! Stop! Don't harm him!
Geralt|I changed my mind.
Verden Woman 01|Leave him be!
Verden Woman 01|Nooo! Stop! Don't harm him!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Greetings. You Glenna?
Verden Woman 03|Aye. But gristle and marrow's all I'm willin' to sell, and you'll have to wait till I'm done carvin' it.
Geralt|Wanted to talk to you about Hanna. Hear you were friendly.
Verden Woman 03|She'd come by atimes, we'd talk.
Geralt|She seem strange lately? Any idea where she might've gone?
Verden Woman 03|Hmm… Strange? No, a cheerful soul, always.
Verden Woman 03|If I'm to judge, it's the wolves got her. Been howlin' the nights through, lately. Even the baron's men're afeared to come by.
Verden Woman 03|Hanna must've gone to the wood, to gather mushrooms, maybe… Strayed too deep, and the howlers got her.
Geralt|You the butcher's wife?
Verden Woman 03|Butcher? Please… Might've called him a butcher when we lived in the shade of Novigrad's walls.
Verden Woman 03|Now he deals in carrion, fallen animals, their bones still fit for soup. So, buyin' somethin'?
Geralt|Thanks. Farewell.
Verden Woman 03|Oh, you again. What is it now?
<|endoftext|>
Verden Smith 01|Can I help you someways?
Geralt|Did you get a good look at the other woman? Know who it was?
Verden Boy 05|No, she walked in front of Aunt Hanna. I couldn't see.
Geralt|Wanted to ask you about Hanna. Heard she looked after your children.
Verden Girl 03|Aunt Hanna? Do you know where she is?
Geralt|No, that's why I'm here. She maybe tell you where she was going? Or anything else?
Verden Girl 03|Hmm… She said turnips are healthy and we ought to eat 'em.
Verden Boy 05|I saw her go to the forest! With another lady! It was dawn almost - I'd gone out so I wouldn't wet the pallet.
Verden Smith 01|The forest? She's done for.
Geralt|Why?
Verden Smith 01|A huge pack roams the area. None from the village dares go in the forest. Niellen's only one not afeared, but then he's a hunter…
Geralt|Thanks. Farewell.
Verden Boy 05|Wow! My dad used to make swords like yours. Can I touch it?
Geralt|It's sharp, better not.
Geralt|Need to talk to your father.
Verden Smith 01|I forged swords once. Now it's scythes and hoes. For good arms, you'll need to go to Novigrad.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Claw marks… Deep…
Geralt|Hmm, no man did this…
Geralt|Hmm. Cuts… made with long claws. Flesh torn clear off.
Geralt|This is getting interesting…
Geralt|Tuft of fur… Ugh, whatever lost it hasn't bathed in a while.
Geralt|Mff… Smell of a rotting corpse. Blood spattered all around.
Geralt|Werewolf - no doubt about it. Gotta be careful.
Geralt|Must be Hanna… Torn to pieces, literally…
Geralt|Blood, and paw marks… Wonder where they lead…
Geralt|Man's clothes - shredded, but no sign of blood.
Geralt|Who rips their own clothes off, leaves 'em in the woods?
Geralt|Sorry it had to end this way…
Geralt|Looks like a hunter's quarters.
Geralt|Notes… Wonder whose…
Geralt|Hmm…Must've climbed this… Should look around some more.
Geralt|Shit, climbed the tree. I can't get up there.
Geralt|Maybe find something else on the ground.
Geralt|Hm, blood's just barely dried. He was dragged here. Wonder where from.
Geralt|Hmm… Where was I?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Greetings.
Verden Peasant 01|Look who the gods have led to us. What brings you here?
Geralt|Not much, just riding through. How are things?
Verden Peasant 01|Oh, evil haunts this place, sir. Remember Hanna? The one went missin' a while past?
Verden Peasant 01|Now we found her sister at the forest's edge. Torn to shreds, she were. Could barely tell it was her.
Verden Peasant 01|Two days on from that Niellen wrapped a bundl, barred and locked his hut, and set off in search of contentment.
Geralt|Say where he was headed?
Verden Peasant 01|No. Can't fault him, though. Knowed only sufferin' and sadness here. No wonder he wants it all behind him, and a new life somehweres else.
Verden Peasant 01|Her man, Niellen, went off into the woods and hasn't come back. Sister's also gone, just up and left the village.
Geralt|She say where she was going?
Verden Peasant 01|Didn't speak to a soul, that one. Only cried, poor girl. Got no family left here, left to seek happiness elsewhere. No wonder, really…
Verden Peasant 01|We found her sister at the forest's edge. Torn to shreds, she were. Could barely tell it was her.
Geralt|Sorry to hear that…
Verden Peasant 01|T'ain't all. Niellen ventured into the woods to drive the beasts away. Three days he'd been gone, so the men assembled, went to look for him.
Verden Peasant 01|Found him dead in the heart of the woods, fifteen wolves round him, their throats ripped open…
Geralt|Farewell.
<|endoftext|>
Verden Peasant 02|She were a good girl… Shame she's gone…
Verden Peasant 01|You blame her? Lost her sister, then her sister's man, parents died long past…
Verden Peasant 02|She did well to go. Be better off elsewhere. Find joy, maybe.
Verden Peasant 02|Argh, loads o' misfortune, loads… Some horror took Hanna first, now they found Margaret and Niellen dead…
Verden Peasant 01|Shame, that. The was good folk.
Verden Peasant 02|Don't know they were that good. No such thing as good folk these days. What ye have's folk who manage to get away with things.
Verden Girl 03|Daddy, will Aunt Hanna visit today?
Verden Smith 01|No… She'll not, child…
Verden Boy 05|Why? Where is she?
Verden Smith 01|Argh, if only I knew…
Verden Peasant 01|She's such a good lass. Find her, please…
Verden Smith 01|All right. Forgin' and hammerin' won't do itself.
Verden Peasant 01|Ye hear? They found Margaret in the woods, bloody somethin' awful, torn to shreds. Some beast must've nabbed her…
Verden Peasant 02|Aye, heard folk talkin'. She must've happened on wolves… But Niellen, that's who I feel for.
Verden Peasant 02|Horrors o' some sort took his wife, now her sister… Got none left to him in this world…
Verden Peasant 01|True. No wonder the lad up and left. Might could find solace elsewhere.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Guard 03|Don't like folk wanderin' around here.
Geralt|Oh, yeah? Well, got a beast you need someone to get rid of? I'm here about the notice.
Novigrad Guard 03|Mh. Supervisor Lund posted it. Yeah, a beast haunts the outskirts, murderin' folk. Got 'em scared to leave their homes after dusk.
Geralt|I aim to hunt down this monster.
Novigrad Guard 03|Best hurry, then. Some other bloke's already after it.
Geralt|When'd you find the last victim?
Novigrad Guard 03|Just last night. Hubert, a beggar, but a decent man. I'd let him sleep in the shed from time to time - that one, on the right.
Novigrad Guard 03|Eustace hasn't come for the corpse yet. It's lyin' in there, where I found it.
Geralt|Any eye-witnesses to these attacks?
Novigrad Guard 03|No, just the bodies.
Novigrad Guard 03|Beast appears only at night, chooses isolated victims.
Geralt|Who took the contract?
Novigrad Guard 03|Didn't see the man. Was just told some brave fool'd turned up.
Geralt|Thanks. So long.
Geralt|Like to talk to this supervisor.
Novigrad Guard 03|Too bad he don't receive petitioners.
Geralt|So what's he do, exactly?
Novigrad Guard 03|Delivers relief on behalf of the city council - flour and groats for the paupers. Meanin', he don't do it personally. He's got men for that. He himself, he, uh…
Geralt|Supervises.
Novigrad Guard 03|Exactly.
Novigrad Guard 03|You're back.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Not the marks of a garkain or a fleder.
Geralt|Blood's all sucked out. A lesser vampire?
Geralt|Blood, but not human. Monster was wounded.
Geralt|Seems like it had lost some strength, was sneaking along the shoreline.
Geralt|Vampire was wounded, needed fresh blood.
Geralt|Wouldn't 'ave ventured far from its lair if it was weak.
Geralt|Tracks end here.
Geralt|Oughta look for prints on the other side.
Geralt|Rat corpses. Not a drop of blood left in 'em.
Geralt|Lair must be nearby.
Geralt|Ekimmara came out of the water here. Gotta look for more tracks.
Geralt|Gotta be an ekimmara.
<|endoftext|>
Lambert|Got our reward to collect. I'm kinda in a hurry. Let's say you've earned half, what the hell.
Geralt|Let's go.
Geralt|Join you for that later. Wait up for me?
Lambert|Fine, but try not take too long. Know where the supervisor has his office?
Geralt|Yeah, had a chat with a guardsman outside it. See you there.
Lambert|Told you to hide.
Geralt|Pretty apparent that wasn't necessary.
Lambert|To think they call me reckless. Ehh, Geralt.
Geralt|Never thought you'd abandon Kaer Morhen so soon, but it's good to see you again, Lambert.
Lambert|Finally listened to me... for once in your life.
Geralt|Nice to see you, too, Lambert. Didn't really need to hide, you know - nothing but a lowly lower vampire, after all. I only did 'cause I thought it'd make you happy.
Lambert|Heheh. Glad to see you, Wolf.
Lambert|Vesemir'd chew you out for such recklessness.
Geralt|There was no need to hide.
Geralt|But I'd rather you tell me what you're doing here. Got the sense you didn't want to stay on at Kaer Morhen much longer, but didn't expect you'd abandon the place so soon.
Lambert|You're right - didn't have the slightest desire to stay on.
Lambert|Good work.
Geralt|What're you doing in Novigrad? Never mentioned coming here.
Lambert|Got a certain matter to take care of.
Geralt|Greetings, Lambert.
Lambert|Damn it's good to see you, Wolf.
Geralt|Decide to do some hunting in Novigrad? Far as I remember, you never liked this city.
Lambert|Still don't. Thing is, got a certain matter to take care of.
Geralt|The matter you mentioned - anything I can help with?
Lambert|Hm. Maybe. But we'll talk about that later.
Geralt|What've you been up to? Any luck on the Path?
Lambert|A lot, in fact. Quite the takings in Lan Exeter. Was asked to hunt down a giant, who turned out to be a forest troll, and some bandits.
Geralt|Bandits?
Lambert|Came as a package with the troll.
<|endoftext|>
Lambert|We dealt with the monster at the docks. Here for our reward.
Novigrad Trader 04|Witchers? Since when do you travel in pairs?
Lambert|Lot of dangers lie in wait for a lone witcher. Bandits, for example.
Novigrad Trader 04|I advise you to change your tone.
Lambert|Where's Jad Karadin? Talk!
Geralt|Who?
Lambert|Trust me, Geralt, this is important. There's something I gotta know.
Novigrad Trader 04|I do not know any Karadin. Take your coin for the before and bugger off. Before I lose my temper!
Lambert|Where's Jad Karadin? Asking you for the last time!
Novigrad Trader 04|Guards! To the dungeon with them!
Geralt|Lambert. Calm down.
<|endoftext|>
Lambert|This guy's more trouble than the ekimmara.
Novigrad Trader 04|Karadin's disappeared, I swear! The others too! I only know of Vienne…
Lambert|What about Vienne?
Novigrad Trader 04|She drinks at the Seven Cats. There day and night.
Lambert|See? You can be helpful…
Geralt|That was murder. Was that really necessary?
Lambert|Yes.
Lambert|More guardsmen'll show soon.
Lambert|Let's go. Meet me at the Seven Cats. Tell you everything there.
Geralt|The tavern Vienne frequents?
Lambert|Yeah. See you later.
Geralt|You crazy? What the hell're you doing?
Lambert|I can explain everything.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Where'll we meet once I'm back?
Lambert|At the Nowhere Inn.
Geralt|All right. I'm off. Good luck.
Geralt|No point in my going to Skellige. Hammond won't tell anybody anything.
Lambert|Why not?
Geralt|I killed him.
Lambert|Why didn't you say anything?
Geralt|Vienne was talking. Didn't want to interrupt.
Lambert|Find anything on Hammond's body? Something that might help us?
Geralt|No.
Lambert|Then I have a request. Go back, to wherever you found him. Look for anything about Karadin. Hammond might've kept some souvenirs of the old days…
Lambert|I'll go to Tretogor, find Selyse. Meet you back at the Nowhere Inn.
Geralt|Found some letters on Hammond's body… might be helpful.
Lambert|I'll look 'em over. Meet me in the morning at the Nowhere Inn.
Geralt|What about Selyse?
Lambert|Let's see what's in the letters, first. Might not need to go to Tretogor at all.
Geralt|Tell you the truth, I just remembered.
Lambert|Ehh, Geralt. Preaching morals to me, yet you forget who you've killed?
Lambert|You gotta help me, Geralt. Best thing'll be to split up. You sail to Skellige, try to squeeze something outta Hammond.
Lambert|I'll go to Tretogor and meet with Selyse.
Geralt|Lambert, let's talk about this.
Lambert|No, let's not. This is one of those situations, serious situations, when you don't ask unnecessary questions and just help your friend.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|All right, high time you explained some things. Why'd you kill Lund? What's this all about?
Lambert|Want the short version or the long one?
Geralt|Lemme hear the whole thing.
Lambert|Had a friend. Aiden was his name.
Geralt|You had a friend?
Lambert|Oh, hi-fuckin'-larious. I met him soon after I'd accepted a contract to lift the curse from the Ogre of Ellander.
Lambert|Aiden had been hired to kill it. He was a witcher from the School of the Cat.
Geralt|Far as I remember, the Ogre was killed in the end.
Lambert|Yeah. After it gutted my employer, we really didn't have a choice. I cut a deal with Aiden. We joined forces, split the reward for killing the Ogre between us.
Lambert|After that, we worked together a lot. Hands down the best man I'd ever met. I mean, I like you, you know that. Still, no comparison.
Geralt|What happened to him?
Lambert|Some time ago Aiden took on a contract to lift a curse. Off a duke's daughter.
Lambert|It was a political mess from the start. Then there was hatred for the School of the Cat to deal with.
Geralt|They worked hard to deserve that hate. Basically turned hired assassins.
Lambert|Aiden wasn't like that.
Lambert|Anyway, some of the duke's courtiers had designs. Weren't at all keen on the curse being lifted from the duke's first born.
Lambert|So a band of trained assassins ambushed Aiden, murdered him. Our dear supervisor was one of them.
Geralt|And Jad Karadin?
Lambert|The assassins' leader. And the one to deal the mortal blow.
Geralt|Sorry about your friend.
Lambert|Don't need your sympathy, just your help.
Lambert|We have to talk to Vienne. Must've had enough to drink by now. Let's go.
Geralt|What do you intend to do?
Lambert|I intend to get even with the bastards who did it. Karadin most of all.
Geralt|You were gonna explain why you murdered the supervisor.
Geralt|Know what, Lambert? Think I'd rather hear the short version after all.
Geralt|I'd prefer something concise.
Lambert|Had a friend - Aiden. A witcher from the School of the Cat.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Vienne?
Elf Female 03|What do you want?
Lambert|We wanna see Jad Karadin.
Elf Female 03|Hahahahahahah! Now why would I help you?
Geralt|It's really important to my friend here.
Elf Female 03|And what will I get out of it?
Lambert|Pay for your beer for starters. Then we'll see how valuable your information is.
Elf Female 03|I was part of Karadin's band, but... when was that? I don't know where to find him, I've fallen out with the lot.
Elf Female 03|Besides, he's no longer chummy with his old mates. Word around town is he's changed.
Geralt|Who else was in Karadin's band?
Elf Female 03|Aside from me? Selyse, Hammond, and Lund. But they've scattered all over the world. Selyse went to Tretogor, Hammond to Skellige, and Lund--
Lambert|Lund's dead.
Elf Female 03|Hahahahaha! Finally met his match. Well, you've only Hammond or Selyse to talk to, then.
Geralt|Satisfied?
Lambert|She doesn't know anything. We need to talk to Hammond and Selyse.
Elf Female 03|Don't go looking for Karadin. If he senses you nipping at his heels, he'll kill you without batting an eye.
Lambert|We'll see. As for you…
Geralt|Do whatever you think's right, Lambert. Not here to preach morals.
Elf Female 03|Haha! "Do what you think is right?" Only one thing worse than cold-blooded murder - hypocrisy.
Elf Female 03|Informers! Racists! Snitches!
Elf Man 02|Vienne? Bloody hell, what is it?!
Elf Female 03|They've come for me, Varen! I told you someone would, sooner or later…
Elf Man 02|{N'ess a tearth. }[Don't be afraid.]
Geralt|Shit.
Geralt|No, Lambert.
Lambert|Right. Better to leave her like this.
Elf Female 03|What about my coin?!
Elf Female 03|Arseholes.
Geralt|This Selyse - where can we find her?
Elf Female 03|She's done well for herself. Runs a brothel in Tretogor, the kind rich men frequent. Whores suck information out of them, then she sells it.
Lambert|Name of this brothel?
Elf Female 03|The Black Lily. Selyse always did have horrible taste.
Geralt|We need information about Hammond.
Elf Female 03|Karadin's right-hand man, once. When the band broke up, he went back to Faroe whence he had come.
Elf Female 03|He's a pirate, now. Even the jarls treat him with respect.
Geralt|What about you? What's your story?
Elf Female 03|Scoia'tael… unit was decimated, so I joined Karadin. They never treated me as an equal. No.
Elf Female 03|I could hit a sparrow from a hundred paces… but I was never good enough for Karadin. He always preferred that cunt Selyse…
Lambert|You have a hand in the murder of the witcher Aiden?
Elf Female 03|Perhaps. I don't remember.
Geralt|Karadin's changed? What do you mean?
Elf Female 03|He's dropped all his old connections, stopped taking on petty killings. He's hidden himself away in some hole. Must be planning something big.
Geralt|My friend's very determined. Just saw him kill a man who refused to help us contact Karadin.
Elf Female 03|You think you scare me? I don't give a fuck what happens to me.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|I'm looking for a man named Hammond.
Crach|Hahaha.
Geralt|What's so funny?
Crach|He's the chief pirate of Faroe, commander of a mighty fleet and a briar in every clan's arse. Though Holger's most of all, as he has to deal with him.
Geralt|Still don't get what part of that amuses you.
Crach|You want something from him, that's clear, but Hammond has no patience for your kind. A few words, and he'll have you thrown in the bear pit.
Crach|After which you'll promptly kill him, and my troubles will be over. That is why I laugh.
Geralt|We'll see how it goes. I'm off to Faroe.
Crach|There's a price on Hammond's head. Once you're done, come see me. I'll pay you gladly.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Warrior 04|Whaddaya want?
Geralt|I'm looking for Hammond.
Skellige Warrior 04|What for?
Geralt|Business.
Skellige Warrior 04|He prays at the chapel on the hill this time of day. If it's slaves you're lookin' to buy, you'll have to wait till he's done.
Geralt|He's praying? Wouldn't have thought him a god-fearing man from what I've heard about him.
Skellige Warrior 04|Hm. Yet it's not somethin' that would surprise any man who knows him.
Skellige Warrior 05|Another snoop! You know the drill!
Geralt|I'll be back.
Skellige Warrior 05|He's been here before. I remember him.
Skellige Warrior 04|What'd he want?
Skellige Warrior 05|Snoopin'.
Skellige Warrior 05|Hey! That's the one killed our lads!
Skellige Warrior 04|I don't like you. Wait outside the gate.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|I'm looking for Jad Karadin.
Skellige Berserker 05|And just who the hell're you?
Geralt|A friend of a friend. I'm looking for Karadin, thought maybe we could make some sort of deal.
Skellige Berserker 05|What, our business rubbin' some Novigrad pricks the wrong way? Ploughin' guilds!
Skellige Berserker 05|C'mon! What ye waitin' for? Kill the fucker!
Geralt|Heard you were in Karadin's band.
Skellige Berserker 05|Fuckin' say what you want. C'mon, spit it out, you arselickin' bastard!
Skellige Berserker 05|Gods of the sea, I've never begrudged ye no gifts. Grant me another victory, so I can make ye another offerin' of me loot.
Geralt|Don't mind me.
Skellige Berserker 05|Fuck, what now?
<|endoftext|>
Lambert|What the hell took you?
Geralt|Pretty likely Karadin lives in Novigrad. And he never severed ties with Hammond. They're actually in business together.
Lambert|Mhm. Learned something, too - he trades in, uh, live goods on the sly. Owns a ship called the Pearl of the Coast - runs between here and Skellige. Changed his name, too, to Roland Treugger, who officially is a respected Novigrad trader and philanthropist.
Lambert|Has a residence in Gildorf.
Geralt|All right. Let's pay Karadin a visit.
Geralt|All right. Meet you outside Karadin's house.
Lambert|Wait for you in a gateway off the Round.
Geralt|Anything on Selyse?
Lambert|Hm. Well, didn't have you there to stand up for her.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Make yourselves at home.
Geralt|He's a witcher.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Very true. Allow me to introduce my wife, Laetitia. And my two little tots.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|You know who I am, and I've heard of you. You've been asking many questions about me. That always draws my attention.
Geralt|What School'd you come out of?
Novigrad Rich Man 03|That of the Cat. So few of us left.
Geralt|My friend needs to talk to you.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Lads, take the children and Laetitia and leave us.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Our guests wish to speak to me.
Geralt|I could understand a witcher becoming a hired assassin, but a merchant?
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Why ever not? Not one among us doesn't dream of changing our life. I simply did not stop at dreaming.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|They say no witcher has ever died in his bed. I aim to be the first.
Lambert|Remains to be seen.
Geralt|Witchers can't have children.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|But they can have wards. Or take in a woman along with her children, embrace them as their own.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Do what you want, Lambert. Your friend, your vengeance.
Lambert|Been waiting a long time for this.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|And I don't aim to die.
Geralt|Leave him. Let's go.
Lambert|You off your fucking nut?
Geralt|Lambert, this is one of those situations when you have to realize you're pissed as hell, rein it in, and trust your cool-headed friend. Let's go.
Lambert|For fuck's sake, Geralt. Don't know that I'll be able to forgive you.
Geralt|I said, let's go. You can always come back.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Thank you.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|I'm all ears.
Lambert|Talk to him Geralt. If I do, first word he says to me, I'll lose it and throttle the fucker.
Geralt|Remember Aiden? A witcher. Murdered in Ellander. Guessing the killers were paid well.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|I remember him as I remember all the others - with the deepest regret.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Yet Aiden was different in a way. Contrary to rumor we did not set out to kill him. We were forced to, when he attacked us.
Geralt|I've heard enough.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|What now?
Geralt|You've changed. You have.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Forgiveness - it's my sole aim now.
Lambert|You're buying this bullshit? Bastard's lying his ass off!
Geralt|Know what, Karadin? Your remorse - it's feigned. Completely dishonest.
Geralt|You put on a good show, but I just don't believe you.
Lambert|Don't even know why we bothered with this chat. We came here to kill you.
Geralt|Maybe you've changed, maybe not. To me and Lambert, it doesn't matter.
Lambert|You killed Aiden. Fuck your new life. I don't believe in giving second chances.
Geralt|We need to leave him alone, Lambert. C'mon.
Lambert|I'm not going anywhere. I came to kill this bastard.
Geralt|What's your version of this story?
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Aiden had accepted a contract to lift the curse from the duke's daughter. He took the coin, bungled the job, then left once the girl passed on.
Lambert|You lie.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|We were not to kill him - we were debt collectors. He'd spent the coin already, so we demanded his swords.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|When he refused, tempers flared. Vienne, positioned as a sniper, lost her nerve. Hit Aiden square in the eye.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Later, she devised her own version of the story. To silence her guilt, I expect.
Geralt|Your wife know who you were?
Novigrad Rich Man 03|We are thoroughly honest with one another, harbor no secrets. She prays for me each day. You know what? I think it's working.
Lambert|Fucking hell.
Geralt|Relax, Lambert.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|I confessed all just before we pledged to marry one another. Began a new life that day, with a clean slate.
Geralt|Nice place you got.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|As it turned out, I've a flair for enterprise. Now I've coin enough to provide my family with the finer things in life.
Lambert|With some leftover for philanthropy.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Miss Marabella's institute does not scorn small donations. Neither does the city's Widows' and Orphans' Relief Fund, amongst others.
<|endoftext|>
Lambert|Thanks for your help, Geralt.
Geralt|You're welcome.
Lambert|Wanna talk about it?
Geralt|No.
Lambert|See you later. Some day.
Geralt|So long, Lambert.
Lambert|Explain yourself.
Geralt|Don't intend to. Just felt Karadin didn't deserve to be murdered in cold blood.
Geralt|If you feel otherwise, you can always go back. Without me.
Lambert|I feel like beating the shit out of you.
<|endoftext|>
Verden Bandit 01|Meat's just about ready - needs a smidgen more.
Verden Bandit 02|Let them gudgeons starve, we've got us a feast!
Verden Bandit 03|It's a pisser, ain't it? A pack o' fattened oinkers in the middle o' nothin'.
Verden Bandit 01|No point ponderin' it. Just dig in.
Geralt|Gladly.
Verden Bandit 01|Caius! Cut the gentlemen a slice o' piglet.
Verden Peasant 03|Nooooo! I won't stand for it! They done roasted Yagoda! The wazzacks!
Verden Bandit 01|Urgh. Him again! You want another bannickin'?
Geralt|What's this about?
Verden Peasant 03|They slaughtered Yagoda! Cooked her up! Wazzacks!
Verden Bandit 01|Same old song… Nothin' doing, gotta wallop him. Caius, Jacob - grab him!
Verden Peasant 03|Nay! Shan't be! Heeelp!
Geralt|He hasn't harmed you. Leave him alone.
Verden Bandit 01|We go all chummy-like, offer you roast hog, and you do this?
Verden Bandit 03|No grockle's gonna give us orders. Clobber 'im, lads!
Geralt|Staying out of this.
Verden Peasant 03|For the love! Help! They'll kill me…! Like they did Yagoda…!
Verden Bandit 01|Get 'im, boys!
Geralt|I'll pass, thanks.
Verden Bandit 01|Your loss. Caius, cut us off another hunk.
Geralt|Quite the banquet. Where'd you get all the meat?
Verden Bandit 01|Found porkers womblin' all about, so we roasted one of 'em.
Verden Bandit 02|Wanna bite? Plenty to go 'round.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|You hurt?
Verden Peasant 03|Oh… Ah… Nay. But Yagoda - oh zounds! They done cooked her!
Geralt|You must've really loved that pig.
Verden Peasant 03|Who are you?
Geralt|I'm Geralt of Rivia.
Verden Peasant 03|Me, I'm Yontek of-of-of… of these parts.
Geralt|The pigs are magic?
Verden Peasant 03|They sure is! See for yourself!
Geralt|Ahh, fine. I'll take a look at the pigs.
Verden Peasant 03|Gert lush!
Geralt|I'll come back.
Verden Peasant 03|…Cheers!
Geralt|Live in this village alone?
Verden Peasant 03|Nay. They's home! Flap and Hagel and Bebon. Only Klaus and Igor 'ave gone missin'.
Geralt|Who are Klaus and Igor?
Verden Peasant 03|Igor's the fool that'd eat grass. Klaus, he's the ealdorman. Every man knows Klaus.
Verden Peasant 03|But where's they now - I dunno! Took by the piggy magic, must be.
Geralt|Greetings, Yontek.
Verden Peasant 03|Uhh… Bye!
Verden Peasant 03|You done seen the piggy magic?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Yontek?
Verden Peasant 03|Aye?
Geralt|The pigs… they do seem to be magic.
Verden Peasant 03|Aye, 'cause… er… 'cause all th-- 'cause o' the sorcery. It done turned 'em all that way.
Geralt|So those pigs, they used to be humans?
Verden Peasant 03|Aye! What did you think?
Verden Peasant 03|Help 'em! Turn 'em back!
Geralt|Need to take a closer look at the, uh, hog hut. Where is it?
Verden Peasant 03|Why, it's thataway, past the hill. You walk and walk, and then you're there. Got it?
Geralt|I'll find it.
Geralt|Where'd you get the key?
Verden Peasant 03|Mhmhmhmh! I found it! Showed it to Igor, right, and he told all the folks to go! Then, they was changed.
Geralt|What changed the people into pigs?
Verden Peasant 03|Twere magic! I done gave Igor the key, he gathered 'em all, off they went.
Geralt|What key is this?
Verden Peasant 03|This 'un! Here! Opens the hog hut, that does.
Geralt|Come back to see you later.
Verden Peasant 03|Aye, gert!
Geralt|About these… people… What happened to them?
Verden Peasant 03|Done changed! In the hog hut. Gave you the key, remember?
Geralt|Finally know what happened to the locals. They fell victim to a curse.
Verden Peasant 03|Ooh… sooo… can you "uncurse" 'em?
Geralt|Yes, but I'll need your help.
Verden Peasant 03|Oh - oh, all right.
Geralt|Some gold was stolen - that's what caused the curse. Know where the gold is?
Verden Peasant 03|I done hid it!
Geralt|Well, you gotta return it, and all the… villagers need to be there when you do.
Verden Peasant 03|Oh… What?
Geralt|Get the gold, and I'll get the pigs together. Meet by the mill, and we'll all go to the hog hut. It oughta work.
Verden Peasant 03|We's gonna save 'em! I'll get the gold.
Geralt|You weren't transformed like the other villagers… Gotta say I'm curious why.
Verden Peasant 03|We-- 'Cause I didn't go with 'em?
Geralt|You didn't take any gold from the temple?
Verden Peasant 03|Uhhhh… nay. Why would I?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|I'm back.
Pig|Hrrrrr…
Geralt|All right, let's talk…
Pig|Hrrroom!
Geralt|Think I know what happened…
Geralt|We're in a temple, and there was a tub full of gold here. Yontek found the key, showed it to the villagers, and they got greedy…
Geralt|Thing is, no one realized the gold might be protected by a curse.
Pig|Hrrr… hr hr hrw…
Geralt|To lift it, we gotta bring back the gold. I should ask Yontek, maybe he knows where it is…
Pig|Hrr rwee rwee!
Geralt|Yontek mentioned that only the herbalist and the ealdorman were missing from the village… Makes you one of them.
Pig|Hrr!
Geralt|You Klaus, the village ealdorman?
Pig|Hrr hrr!
Geralt|You're the local herbalist?
Pig|Hrr!
Geralt|Heard about you. Igor?
Pig|Hrroom!
Geralt|Nice to meet you, I'm Geralt.
Geralt|Know this place?
Pig|Hrr…
Geralt|This a tomb?
Pig|Hrr hrr!
Geralt|Hmm….
Geralt|We in a temple?
Pig|Hrrooo…
Geralt|There was gold here… Know what happened to it?
Pig|Hrr. Hrr.
Geralt|Hmm. Gotta talk to Yontek about this.
Geralt|Wait here. I should look around.
Pig|Hrrr hr…
Geralt|See you later.
Pig|Hrrrooo…
Geralt|Don't know how long you've been here, but you gotta be hungry. Got something tasty for you…
Pig|Hrrr hee hee hrr hrr…
Geralt|Guess it was tasty.
Geralt|Take care - and don't get grilled.
Pig|Hrr!
Geralt|Medallion's vibrating. Pig must be from the village, too.
Pig|Hrr hrr hrr hrr!
Geralt|Wait, that sounded like… You understand me?
Pig|Hrr!
Geralt|All right, let's try this. One oink for yes, two for no. Got it?
Pig|Hrr!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Get moving, chubs.
Geralt|This way, Mr. Pig.
Geralt|Time to go, porker.
Geralt|And we're here.
Geralt|Go. Join the… others.
Geralt|We're here.
Geralt|Gotta herd the pigs there somehow… Axii, maybe?
Geralt|Move it, lard ass.
Geralt|Get moving. Towards the mill, piggies. Wait for me there.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Hey, where the hell--?
Geralt|C'mon, get over there!
Geralt|Let's go, move it!
Geralt|Keep moving, hurry it up!
Geralt|Go, go move!
Geralt|Let's go.
Verden Peasant 03|Lezzgo!
Verden Peasant 03|Beasties! They's a-hurtin' 'em!
Verden Peasant 03|Protect 'em! D-defend 'em!
Geralt|Gotta go back for the pigs. They've scattered.
Geralt|Pigs ran off… Let's go back.
Geralt|Dammit, they ran off.
Geralt|Gotta get 'em together again. Damn pigs.
<|endoftext|>
Verden Peasant 01|I'm meself again. Thank ye.
Verden Peasant 02|Too early for joy. We need a headcount… o' human heads.
Verden Peasant 02|Just three of us?! Our whole village, murdered, 'cause o' him!
Geralt|Saved as many of you as I could.
Verden Peasant 01|But it were Yontek brought us the key!
Verden Peasant 02|Must've known the gold was cursed! He didn't wanna go with us!
Verden Peasant 03|But… I didn't… 'Twas Igor! Igor wanted…
Verden Peasant 01|Won't get out of this, dung breath! Get 'im!
Verden Peasant 03|Help me.
Geralt|First one to raise a hand against Yontek loses it.
Verden Peasant 01|Now, now, we was just…
Verden Peasant 02|Freak's likely to gut us - let's go from here, quick.
Verden Peasant 03|Ooh, thanks!
Geralt|Probably shouldn't go back to the village, could end badly for you. Need to find another place for yourself.
Verden Peasant 03|Uhh… Right. Whatever that means. Godspeed now.
Geralt|This… is no longer my concern.
Verden Peasant 02|Good thing, too. Let's take 'im to the village. Make him pay for what he's done.
Geralt|Yeah. Speaking of pay…
Verden Peasant 02|Oh, aye… Not all survived, though - can't give you much. Here - some coin.
Verden Peasant 01|Time to go back. Got us a guilty man to hang…
Verden Peasant 03|But naaay!
Verden Peasant 02|Oh, aye… Good work, witcher, gotta say. Here's your coin.
Geralt|If not for me, you'd still be a pig. On a spit by now, most likely.
Verden Peasant 01|Not many of us left.
Verden Peasant 02|Tis his fault!
Verden Peasant 01|We're almost all of us.
Verden Peasant 01|Thank ye, White One.
Geralt|Thank Yontek. He helped me a lot.
Geralt|Yontek brought me here. Lucky to have him among you.
Verden Peasant 01|We's all here! Well… 'cept for Yagoda.
Verden Peasant 03|What'd you do?! There's just Igor!
Verden Peasant 01|Where's the others…?
Geralt|Did what I could.
Verden Peasant 03|Ain't no folk, all's lost! Let's go!
Verden Peasant 01|Back to the village?
Verden Peasant 03|Ain't no village! Ain't no us! C'mon, Igor!

Geralt|Need some armor, really good armor. Word is you're the one to talk to about that.
Fergus Graem|Well, I've been at it twenty years, now. Mastered the craft in some respects, if I do say so myself.
Blacksmith Woman|You wish…
Fergus Graem|Don't listen to her. She's been sore lately, snortin' every chance she gets.
Fergus Graem|So, what kind of armor are we talkin' about?
Geralt|Light but durable. Can't constrain movement, and I gotta be able to get in it without anybody's help.
Fergus Graem|That all? Sure it shouldn't be self-cleanin'? And how about it wipe your arse after ye take a shite in the bushes?
Geralt|Sounds great. Can you make a suit like that?
Fergus Graem|No, but find someone who can, and I'll gladly meet 'em.
Fergus Graem|Oughta know one thing when it comes to armor: if it's gotta be durable, it can't be light.
Blacksmith Woman|It can. Just needs the proper tools to make it. Tools like the folk of Clan Tordarroch used on Undvik.
Fergus Graem|Yoana, I told you time and again to stay silent when I talk to customers. Shouldn't pester folk with those nonsense Skellige legends o' yours.
Blacksmith Woman|It ain't legend, and it ain't nonsense. My granddad would go to Undvik for his armor, said Tordarroch folk made the best. Till last year, that is, when a giant ravaged their island. Inhabitants either ran off or died, but the forge should still be in one piece.
Geralt|Worth looking into. Say I find the tools, will you craft the armor for me?
Fergus Graem|Ahem. On condition you bring the tools. But only then.
Geralt|These legends mention where the forge might be?
Blacksmith Woman|Yes, north side of the isle, in a cave. Clan folk carved out a rock face to build it.
Geralt|Look for the tools next time I'm in Skellige. Take care now.
Geralt|Forge was carved out of a rock face. Probably why it still stands. Tools were inside…
Fergus Graem|Well, goose kick me! These look like the real thing…
Blacksmith Woman|Because they are - look at the markings! Authentic! How did you get them?!
Geralt|Wasn't easy. Sooo… I'm hoping for a good price - on that armor of mine.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 02|Harmon aep Groenekan, lieutenant general of the Second Mounted Army.
Fergus Graem|Welcome to our humble establishment! A true honor to host one of such renown! I've heard the general's a connoisseur and collector of armor.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 02|This is true. And they call you a master of the craft.
Fergus Graem|All too kind, sir, tru--
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|I need a suit of armor. Heavy, able to withstand piercing projectiles.
Fergus Graem|Piercin' projectiles? Bolts, you mean? Hmm, that ain't easy, needs a special alloy, temperin'…
Blacksmith Woman|The new tools - we can do it! Stoke the fire, I'll ready the rest!
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|Bold, your worker. You allow her much.
Fergus Graem|Er, you know how it is, general. Good help's hard to come by. We should go outside, there's business to discuss…
Blacksmith Woman|It's always the same! I've had enough!
Geralt|Enough?
Blacksmith Woman|They treat me like I'm nobody, the menial labor. Truth is, the Nilfgaardian, the one Fergus is kissing up to - I'll have to craft his armor. Yours, too, for that matter.
Geralt|Hmm… So what's Fergus do?
Blacksmith Woman|Horseshoes, nails… Not much else he can do, seeing as he cocks up simple bungs.
Blacksmith Woman|But in the end, they call him "master." No one'd ever think I could be a skilled armorer - a human, and a woman to boot. A dwarven blacksmith - that's another story…
Geralt|If that's the case, stand your ground. Don't let him treat you like this.
Blacksmith Woman|I won't, not anymore. He can craft the Nilfgaardian's armor himself. I'll make another suit, and we'll see which one's better.
Blacksmith Woman|I need but one thing I can't get on my own. Would you help me?
Geralt|Depends what it is.
Blacksmith Woman|To finish the armor, I'll need to harden it, quench it in a bath. Oil's what we usually use, but I want to use acid.
Geralt|Hmm… Kikimores and archgriffins spit acid.
Blacksmith Woman|Archgriffins? Draconic griffins, you mean? Baron's men came by a few days back. Said they'd seen one north of Crow's Perch. It'd killed some folk out there.
Geralt|Bound to be a notice posted for the griffin anyway. Could kill two beasts with one stone. Fine, I'll see what I can do.
Blacksmith Woman|Bring me the acid, and I'll prove I'm better than Fergus. And I'll craft armor for you, lots of it, the kind no other armorer can.
Geralt|Hmm… Need to think about it.
Blacksmith Woman|I see. Well, I've work to do. But should you decide to help me… I'd craft armor for you, lots of it. The kind no other armorer can.
Geralt|Gotta admit, find your story hard to believe myself…
Blacksmith Woman|I'll prove it to you. Fergus can make the Nilfgaardian's armor himself. I'll craft another suit. We'll see who's is better.
Geralt|Can't turn away a Nilfgaardian general, I get it… But hope it doesn't mean you've forgotten about my armor.
Blacksmith Woman|We haven't. Well, I haven't, and won't. 'Cause I'll be the one to make it, understand? And the Nilfgaardian's armor. And every other suit he agrees to make.
Geralt|Long story… Might tell it some day, but right now I need that armor.
Geralt|Comfortable, strong and light'll do just fine.
Geralt|Went to Undvik a while ago. Found these.
Geralt|Looking for someone who can craft me some armor. Gotta be top quality.
Fergus Graem|Welcome to our humble forge. How can we be of help?
<|endoftext|>
Blacksmith Woman|Geralt! It's done.
Geralt|Looks… very professional.
Fergus Graem|Welcome, general. Armor's all ready. Came out splendid, if I do say so myself.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|Rather coarse. I trust the appearance does not reflect the quality.
Blacksmith Woman|General, I've also made a suit. If you please…
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|What is the meaning of this?
Geralt|Exactly what it looks like. Yoana crafted a suit of armor for you, general. To prove she's the superior armorer.
Fergus Graem|For gods' sake, Yoana… What do you think you're doin'?
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|Temeria remains a wild land, it seems. Insubordination of this kind is not something we Nilfgaardians allow.
Blacksmith Woman|If I may, general. I am Fergus' subordinate in appearance alone. It's what we agreed, as few would ever believe a woman to be a better armorer than a dwarf.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|You are right. I, for one, do not think it possible. But you are confident in your abilities. Let us put them to the test. Not on dummies. In live combat.
Baron Bandit Strong 02|Ho, ho, quite a crowd.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|You there. Put on this armor.
Baron Bandit Strong 02|Err… I'm just here to shoe me horse…
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|Mine is not a request.
Blacksmith Woman|General, I crafted this armor for a man. It can't fit me properly.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|Then find another to wear it.
Blacksmith Woman|Geralt? Will you help?
Geralt|Fine. Hope I won't regret this…
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|Don your armor, both. I will await outside.
Geralt|Got you your acid, but that's where I draw the line. Not about to risk my life again.
Blacksmith Woman|Please. If you don't, I'll never prove I'm the master artisan, and that Fergus is nothing but a fraud.
Geralt|Sorry, can't help you.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|So, no volunteers? As I thought. The farce has ended, at last.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|How much for the armor?
Fergus Graem|Well, it's just as I said…
Blacksmith Woman|So, that's that. Shame you refused to trust me. Fergus… the midget's an amateur, and I made a beautiful suit of armor. Not my first, either…
Blacksmith Woman|Naught left for me here. Maybe I'll have better luck elsewhere. Farewell.
Geralt|I wanna know more about the test.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|I ordered armor that would stop bolts - how do you think I intend to test it?
Blacksmith Woman|Geralt, you've nothing to worry about. This armor will easily withstand a bolt. Acid-hardened, they'd need a ballista to pierce it. Help me, please.
Geralt|General, Yoana's the master artisan, not Fergus. She crafted this armor to prove it.
<|endoftext|>
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|Stand. I wish to see the armor.
Geralt|Not even a dent.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|I am not easily impressed, but I must admit you have succeeded, my dear.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|Where to, dwarf? You must hear this. The forge is now Miss Yoana's. She will also assume all Nilfgaardian army requisitions. Is that clear?
Fergus Graem|Aye, as day.
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|Your pay for the armor. I will send a man to collect it.
Fergus Graem|I'll be goin', too, methinks… Just get my things.
Blacksmith Woman|Wait. We needn't part ways, Fergus. You've been a good helper - we could go on that way. But… without the lie…
Fergus Graem|Hmm… We did make quite the pair.
Blacksmith Woman|Well then, go stoke the fire. We've got a customer, he needs armor fit for a witcher.
Blacksmith Woman|You weren't certain the armor would protect you. Admit it.
Geralt|Master craftsmanship's something I trust in, something I strive for myself. Wouldn't have asked for legendary tools from Undvik and archgriffin acid if you didn't know what you were doing.
Blacksmith Woman|Thank you for trusting me. Give us a few days, and your armor'll be ready.
Blacksmith Woman|Come on, let me help you get out of that.
Geralt|Had a moment of doubt when the bolt pierced Fergus' armor. Didn't last long, though.
Geralt|Gonna live?
Baron Bandit Strong 02|Ah… Aye. But this armor's rubbish.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Priestess 01|Greetings. What may I help you with this time?
Geralt|Morkvarg - got a few more questions.
Skellige Priestess 01|Yes? What is it?
Geralt|I've come for my reward.
Skellige Priestess 01|But can you be sure that--?
Geralt|Morkvarg's gone, for good. Guaranteed, or you'll get your coin back.
Skellige Priestess 01|I shall hold you to that, witcher.
Geralt|Word is you've got a problem - Morkvarg, that's its name? Could tend to it for you.
Skellige Priestess 01|Do so and you will greatly please the goddess.
Geralt|That's nice and all, but coin's what pleases me.
Skellige Priestess 01|You look the type. Fret not, I shall pay. But only if you rid us of Morkvarg - once and for all.
Skellige Priestess 01|There have been those who have killed Morkvarg, but a curse has brought him back each time.
Geralt|The curse - tell me more.
Skellige Priestess 01|Archpriestess Ulve cast it…
Skellige Priestess 01|It bound Morkvarg to the garden for all time. So even if he is killed, he returns there.
Geralt|Mhm, so you said.
Geralt|Notice I read didn't mention a curse.
Skellige Priestess 01|All who live here know of it.
Geralt|Could be, but I'm not from around here. Could use some information.
Skellige Priestess 01|Archpriestess Ulve cast the curse…
Geralt|Never heard of this Morkvarg. What is it exactly?
Skellige Priestess 01|Not what - who.
Skellige Priestess 01|The worst man Skellige has ever known. He held nothing sacred - raided the lands of his own clan, took gold from Nilfgaard, murdered women heavy with child, and children he…
Geralt|Mhm. I know the type.
Skellige Priestess 01|They said he feared but one thing, albeit secretly - the wrath of the gods. Morkvarg decided to prove everyone, himself included, wrong. So he came to Hindarsfjall to raid the goddess' garden. This was years ago.
Skellige Priestess 01|Archpriestess Ulve stood in his path. He stabbed her in the breast and cast her into the mud. As her blood gushed forth, she cursed Morkvarg… and he transformed into a monster.
Geralt|Could you be more specific? "Monster" can mean a lot of things these days. Folk have been known to call me that.
Skellige Priestess 01|I'm afraid I cannot tell you more, for I've never seen him myself. But…
Geralt|Hm?
Skellige Priestess 01|You might speak with Toradar's son, Einar. He saw Morkvarg and his men descend on the garden. He was the sole pilgrim to escape with his life that day.
Skellige Priestess 01|Settled in Larvik. You'll find him at the landing there, provided he's not at sea.
Geralt|Might've already run into this Morkvarg. He a… werewolf?
Skellige Priestess 01|I know not. I… I'm afraid I've never seen him.
Geralt|Shame, that. Was hoping you could tell me more about him. Help me with my work.
Geralt|Farewell.
Skellige Priestess 01|The goddess protect you from all evil.
Geralt|Morkvarg. Lemme tend to him for you.
Geralt|Greetings. Can I have a word?
Skellige Priestess 01|A witcher? Here? It's the goddess' doing, it must be.
Geralt|Hm. Kindness like that can only mean one thing - you got a monster problem.
Skellige Priestess 01|It's no common monster. It's Morkvarg.
Skellige Priestess 01|I am here to serve pilgrims who've come to venerate the goddess.
Geralt|Mine's more an earthly matter.
Skellige Priestess 01|What is it?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|So, no joy in being a werewolf?
Morkvarg Warewolf|Nay, hrr it's the worrrrrrst hrr… Not hrrr hrr the garrrrrden hrr to which I'm bound, hrr even… but the hungerrr hrr.
Morkvarg Warewolf|Hrr anything I devour hrrr turrrns to ash, hrr ash! I cannot eat, hrrr I cannot drink hrr, yet I bloody live and rrrrroam and prrrowlrrrr hrrrr…
Morkvarg Warewolf|The hungerrrr is terrrrib-- argh terrrible! I bite my own flesh, hrrr but the smallest morrrrrsel burrrrns my thrrro-hrrr-throat. Hrr like hrr boiling tarrrrr hrrrr…
Geralt|Everlasting hunger - classic as curses go.
Morkvarg Warewolf|Hrrr know hrrr… how to frrrree hrr me?
Geralt|Cases like this, sometimes it's simple - feed the cursed one of your own will, not theirs. Other times it can be a real bitch.
Morkvarg Warewolf|Hrr help, or I'll hrr returrn to shrrred you, hrrr rrrip you limb frrrom limb!
Geralt|See what I can do.
Morkvarg Warewolf|Hr see and do, hrr or I shall hrr return hrrr.
Geralt|Wouldn't count on it.
Morkvarg Warewolf|Fool! Hrr you can kill me once hrr, twice hrr, thrrrice hrr. But in the end I shall conquerrr hrr. Best lift the currrrrrse! Hrraaaugh!
Geralt|Goes to explain why all those corpses went untouched.
Geralt|Here, put this on.
Morkvarg Warewolf|I need hrrr hrrr no morrre fangs hrrr…
Geralt|Don't be a smartass. Just do it.
Geralt|Looking for a man named Craven. Apparently came here to kill you.
Morkvarg Warewolf|Hrr seems hrrr hrrr it didn't work out! Hrr…
Morkvarg Warewolf|Hrr those who come hrr hrrr rrarrely introduce themselves. Hrr hrr hrr what hrr did he look like? Hrrr…
Geralt|Uhh, no idea.
Morkvarg Warewolf|Hrr then I cannot hrr help you! Hrr I've shredded hrrr hrr many! Hrr hrr…
Geralt|Mentioned a reward of some kind.
Morkvarg Warewolf|Hrr looted, hr hr hr raided, hrr drunk most away hrr… Bu-- All but one hrrr…
Morkvarg Warewolf|Hrr true trreasure, hrrr hid away. Yours, hrr hrr just…  hrr help me hrr hrr!
Geralt|Tiresome conversation. Not interested.
Morkvarg Warewolf|What will you dooo?! Hrrr…
Geralt|What a witcher ought to.
Geralt|Farewell.
Morkvarg Warewolf|Hrr see you hrr soooon hrrr…
Geralt|Willing to talk now?
Morkvarg Warewolf|Only now can I. Ssssuch is the currrse. Hrrr makes me bite, hrr ssssscrrratch, mangle hrrr hrrr… till I drrrrop hrrrr…
Morkvarg Warewolf|You've got time… beforrre the blood's gone frrrrom me! An- and I rrrreturrrn. Listen, hrrr hrrr, carefully.
Morkvarg Warewolf|Hrr undo-- undo the currrse… Hrr frrrreee me, hrr finally… I will… I will… rrrrewarrrd hrr you hrrr…
Geralt|Here we are again.
Morkvarg Warewolf|You can hrrr hrrr hrrr end this. Hrrrre-- hrrrrrelease me!
Geralt|See if we can do this the easy way. Morkvarg, of my own free will I offer you this fare. Now, dig in.
Morkvarg Warewolf|Won't turrrn hrrr to ash?
Geralt|Won't know until you try. C'mon, a spoonful for daddy…
Morkvarg Warewolf|Hrrr bleeeugh akh akh… Fuck! Hrr hrrr akh! This shite again! Akh!
Geralt|Have a bite of this. Oughta lift the curse.
Morkvarg Warewolf|Hrrr better hrrr be trrue… or I'll rrrip you! Shrrred you! Hrr…
Morkvarg Warewolf|Aaaaarrrrgh! What-- hrr what did you dooo?!
Geralt|That was your own flesh. Far as I know, curse doesn't allow for that.
Morkvarg Warewolf|Hrr aaaarrrrgh!!! Whorrreson! You trrricked me! Deceiverrrr grrrrrr.
Geralt|Hardly. Wanted me to lift the curse? Well, you're welcome.
Morkvarg Warewolf|Hrrr said the same hrr hrr… last you werrrre herrre hrrrr…
Geralt|Relax, this is different. This'll work.
Geralt|Could try the meat again…
Morkvarg Warewolf|Hrr you hrr fucking try it, hrr you hr prrrrrrick!
Morkvarg Warewolf|Hrrr nooooothing?! Hrrr is this mockerrrry? Hrr hrr think this a diverrsion? Hrrr hrr I catch you again, hrrrrr I'll have rrrrrrreason to laugh hrrr hrr.
<|endoftext|>
Morkvarg|Ah. I'm free! Ah! Free! At last! Ah!
Morkvarg|Ooooh! Where's the tavern?! Hah! I could eat a broiled pig - hahahaha! No! A side of beef! Hah. Wash it down with a cask of ale! Haaa... then, to sea! Hahaha! They've forgot me, no doubt! Aha! Well I'll fuckin' remind 'em with a bang! In Novigrad, everywhere! Hah! I'm back!
Geralt|Sorry, can't let that happen.
Morkvarg|Then why'd you bloody free me?
Geralt|To kill you. Once and for all.
Geralt|Fair winds and all, but before you go, my reward…?
Morkvarg|Right… Nearly forgot!
Geralt|Happens often. Too often.
Morkvarg|Calm yourself. I'm a man of honor. Now listen, you'll go to Novigrad, to the Bits. Find the vulture, the money lender. Tell him Morkvarg sends his regards, and you'll know me to be a generous man.
Morkvarg|Farewell, then. The sea beckons!
<|endoftext|>
Morkvarg Warewolf|Hrrr you've beat me… but… I will rrrrreturrrrn hrrr… unless you help hrrr…

Geralt|Honestly? Rather just kill you.
Morkvarg Warewolf|You know hrr hrr… I will hrr returrrn hrrragh!

Geralt|If I have to. I'm all ears.
Morkvarg Warewolf|Warrrrriorrrrrs hrrr came hrr… They knew they could not kill me hrrr hrr… So they laid a trap hrrr… chained me down hrrr… locked me in here… hrrr…
Morkvarg Warewolf|Hrrr know what I did? Hrrraa I bit my leg off hrrr to free myself hrrr… Every bite hrr brought pain aaaaaand howling. I vomited blood hrr…
Geralt|Mhm. Biting off your own limbs hurts - who would've thunk?

Morkvarg Warewolf|Hrr no. I want you hrrr to underrrstand! Hhrrrraaaa!

Skellige Warrior 05|Greetings. Praise Freya.
Geralt|Liar.
Skellige Warrior 05|What? I swear it on the Great Mother's tits--
Geralt|Cut the act. Don't buy your piety one bit. You were one of Morkvarg's men.
Skellige Warrior 05|Well, well. Sharp y'are… Didn't see one thing, though.
Skellige Warrior 05|Lads here around me - they're mine. Armed to the teeth to the man. Let me introduce yous.
Geralt|Can't wait.
Skellige Warrior 05|You're daft. You're alone. What's your plan, eh?
Geralt|Lemme show you.
Geralt|I'm no knight errant, I'm a witcher. Didn't come here to bring you to justice.
Skellige Warrior 05|Diggin' up the past - what's that for?
Geralt|Need to know what actually happened in the garden. Gonna lift Morkvarg's curse.
Skellige Warrior 05|Why would you bloody do that? Whoreson should suffer till Ragh nar Roog - the day after, actually!
Geralt|Might surprise you, but I couldn’t care less what a lying murderer has to say.
Skellige Warrior 05|Compared to Morkvarg, I'm a ploughin' saint.
Skellige Warrior 05|I've raided often and cruelly, killed women, children, whatever my axe happened to hit. But priestesses? It was too much, even for me.
Skellige Warrior 05|When… when it was over, and Morkvarg was drinkin' with the rest, I took this out.
Geralt|Wolf fang pendant… covered in runes.
Skellige Warrior 05|I got it from my da, who was godi of our village. Told me that anyone I cut with the fang would suffer a fate worse than death. Spoke true, it seems.
Geralt|Your pop-pop mention how to reverse this?
Skellige Warrior 05|Victim needs to get the fang, is all. But I'll not give it to you. That whoreson should suffer.
Geralt|Listen, the priestesses? They really long to get their garden back. And as I see it, you owe them, don't you think?
Skellige Warrior 05|All right, take it. But it don't come free - want one thing in return.
Geralt|Won't tell anyone about your past. Give you my word.
Skellige Warrior 05|Not that. If you do, I'll just find you and kill you.
Skellige Warrior 05|Once Morkvarg's human again - you can't let him leave. No matter what.
Geralt|I'll take the fang. You can either hand it over or…
Skellige Warrior 05|Word of advice - never threaten a Skellige warrior. Especially one's got command of a longship.
Geralt|It's what I do.
Skellige Warrior 05|Used to say the same myself… till Morkvarg gave the order to sail for Hindarsfjall.
Geralt|You were there when Morkvarg raided the garden. Heard you alone survived.
Skellige Warrior 05|True. I managed to flee. Great Mother was lookin' out for me that day.
Geralt|Mhm. But she didn't give a lick about the priestesses.
Skellige Warrior 05|Apparently… Morkvarg had them bound, then slit their throats like horses for the sacrifice. And he laughed. Understand? He laughed.
Skellige Warrior 05|But Archpriestess Ulve cursed him with her dying breath. "You are beastly now - remain so for evermore!" Ahh, saintly woman!
Geralt|Liar.
Geralt|What happened to Morkvarg?
Skellige Warrior 05|Hard to believe, but fur rose through his skin, and his mug stretched forth into a muzzle, like a dog's or a wolf's. He howled, long and grieving, then lunged at his men.
Skellige Warrior 05|They tried to run, but he was fast as lightnin'. As he killed them, clamped his jaws round their throats, they turned to ash - just like that! Ash that seeped from 'twixt his fangs.
Geralt|Not good. Curse must be complex, multi-leveled.
Skellige Warrior 05|Such is the Great Mother's power.
Geralt|Didn't help the priestesses? Why not?
Skellige Warrior 05|How could I? Alone against a dozen raiders that-- Why you starin'?
Geralt|Just wondering. You people - obsessed with honor, courage and so on… But you just cut and run? Strange.
Skellige Warrior 05|I ain't proud of it.
Skellige Warrior 05|Since that day, I been seekin' a worthy death at sea. Seems the goddess, she's not seen fit to summon me. Yet.
Geralt|Thanks for your help.
Skellige Warrior 05|Goddess guide your sword.
Geralt|See you.
Skellige Warrior 05|Jorre, ye dimwit! Drop one more and I'll keelhaul you!
Geralt|Got a minute?
Skellige Warrior 05|Preparin' my boat, can't ye see? Nilfgaardian dogs - we're to hunt us some!
Geralt|Got bigger game in mind. Morkvarg.
Skellige Warrior 05|Aaah, so them's your apples. All right, ask away. In praise of Freya…
Skellige Warrior 05|Go on, lads! One to kill him gets his swords!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Need the key.
Geralt|Morkvarg broke through this door. Must've smelled something beyond it.
Geralt|Some daredevil, came to challenge Morkvarg… Been here for years.
Geralt|Something strapped to his belt… Keys. Might come in handy.
Geralt|Wolf-- no, werewolf leg. Chewed off…
Geralt|Morkvarg? Behind this wall, sounds like.
Geralt|Ideal friend. Patient, doesn't mouth-off…
Geralt|Hm, cozy…
Geralt|Draft from below. A cave?
Geralt|Air's moving here… Must be another cave above, or a way out.
Geralt|Bones fell through the crevice… years ago.
Geralt|Skull on a stick. Interesting decor.
Geralt|Untouched, no sign of feeding… Morkvarg doesn't devour his victims. Strange.
Geralt|Symbol of Freya.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Always did know how to win friends.
Yennefer|I was provoked.
Geralt|Mhm, saw it happen. Wanted to talk to me about something?
Yennefer|Amos var Ypsis, a specialist on djinns - heard of him? I found a tome he'd penned in the emperor's library. Var Ypsis set off for Skellige one day and was never heard from again.
Yennefer|I asked some of the local folk. Some here still remember him.
Geralt|They know what happened to him?
Yennefer|The locals say they last saw his ship off the coast of Hindarsfjall. Then a once-in-an-eon storm broke.
Geralt|So he's probably fish food by now.
Yennefer|Not necessarily. I must learn what became of him.
Geralt|Why? D'you know him?
Yennefer|No. It's not the mage who interests me - it's his djinn.
Geralt|All right. So what exactly do you expect me to do?
Yennefer|You must help me find this djinn.
Yennefer|I've no gold to offer in reward… but I shall be ever so grateful.
Geralt|Since you put it that way… fine, I'll help you.
Yennefer|Thank you. A boat awaits in the harbor. Come.
Geralt|Sorry, Yen. If you wanna go djinn hunting, I'm afraid you're on your own.
Yennefer|The most I can hope to accomplish on my own are a few chats with angry Skelligers.
Yennefer|If that's how you wish to be, I shall travel to Vizima. Emperor must be wondering what progress we've made…
Geralt|Do what you gotta do.
Geralt|I'm gonna follow some other leads. Something to finally put us on Ciri's trail - that's what we need.
Yennefer|Good luck.
Geralt|I'm going to see the baron. Collect Uma from him, then ride for Kaer Morhen.
Yennefer|I shall join you as soon as I can.
Geralt|Storm wouldn't pose a threat if he'd had a djinn. He could just utter a wish.
Yennefer|Perhaps he had none left. Or something unexpected happened…
Geralt|Know where to look - for the mage and the djinn?
Yennefer|The locals say they last saw Amos' ship off the coast of Hindarsfjall. Just before a once-in-an-eon storm broke.
Geralt|Doubt we'll find them, then. Mage is probably fish food, and the djinn escaped.
Yennefer|Not necessarily. But even if it is so, I'll not give up without seeing some evidence. Will you help me?
Geralt|Why're you even interested? Djinns are dangerous sometimes, and malicious all the time.
Yennefer|I remember. But the advantages outweigh the risks. If I can tame a djinn, I shall gain incredible power. And that could be useful to us one of these days.
Geralt|You sure this mage actually had a djinn?
Yennefer|His books strongly suggest he did. He describes taming one, harnessing energy from its power.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Lead the way.
Yennefer|Just once you might try to take the initiative.
Geralt|Would you even let me?
Yennefer|It would depend on the situation.
Yennefer|Geralt, over here.
Geralt|See you've managed to prepare everything already…
Yennefer|I have.
Geralt|How could you possibly know I'd agree?
Yennefer|I didn't. Decided to risk it…
<|endoftext|>
Yennefer|The ship carrying the djinn sank somewhere in this area.
Geralt|Not too precise as leads go…
Yennefer|I'll cast a spell on our boat. We'll know if there are any wrecks on the seafloor below us.
Geralt|All right, let's get to work.
Yennefer|Mind if I take the helm?
Geralt|Ugh. I got a choice?
Yennefer|No.
Yennefer|Getting in or not?
Yennefer|Geralt, how long must I wait? Are you ready to sail?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Not sure this djinn thing's a good idea.
Yennefer|We managed to seize one before. Do you remember?
Geralt|Course. Dandelion almost lost his voice that time.
Yennefer|Haha. How lucky your 'exorcism' saved it. It was poetic.
Geralt|Yeah, how was I supposed to know that incantation meant "Begone and plough yourself?"
Yennefer|You should've studied foreign languages.
Geralt|Gonna keep bringing that up for the rest of my life?
Yennefer|Of course. Your last wish effectively assured it.
Geralt|My wish was about us being together always, not about you mocking my every mistake.
Yennefer|"Careful what you wish for." And when your wish is granted, you must accept it with all attendant circumstances.
Geralt|Yeah…
Yennefer|And as for your missteps - I don't rightly see why I shouldn't laugh if they're amusing.
Yennefer|There's something here… On the bottom.
Yennefer|It's too deep here. You can't dive that long.
Geralt|You underestimate me.
Yennefer|On the contrary. After all, I asked you for help.
Yennefer|I'll cast a spell. It will slow your heart for a time, you can stay submerged longer.
Yennefer|How's it going?
Geralt|Yen, you know I hate it when you read my mind.
Yennefer|Strictly speaking, I'm not reading your mind, but using telepathy.
Yennefer|Besides, you've nothing to hide, right?
Geralt|Wouldn't admit it if I did. Not the point.
Yennefer|See anything interesting?
Geralt|A shipwreck and a cavern. I'll look inside.
Geralt|Snapped masts, busted planks, and a whole swarm of drowners.
Geralt|Probably drawn by the corpses of drowned crew. Then made their nest here.
Geralt|There's also a Clan Drummond figurehead.
Yennefer|Not the right ship. Come back up.
Yennefer|How's your bath? Water warm enough for you?
Geralt|Jump in, see for yourself.
Yennefer|Sea water wreaks havoc on my complexion.
Yennefer|Just find the wreck.
Yennefer|Get rid of them!
Yennefer|Don't you dare disembark before disposing of every last siren.
Geralt|Last one.
Yennefer|Time to check the bottom.
Yennefer|You're getting better at this.
Geralt|Go even quicker if you helped me down there.
Yennefer|I prefer to observe matters from up here, most definitely.
Geralt|Yeah, like when we were looking for the golden dragon and an avalanche swept us off the trail?
Geralt|Me clinging to the remains of a bridge for dear life, you gripping my waist, admiring the view. Remember?
Geralt|Chasm below us was breathtaking - rustling trees, a lazily flowing stream…
Yennefer|I remember… Though I found myself admiring what I had right in front of me.
Geralt|Let's see if our djinn's down there.
Yennefer|Something's here. Another wreck.
Geralt|Ugh. Gotta deal with the sirens first.
Geralt|Hit and sunk.
Yennefer|Here's hoping you're just as good at searching sunken ships.
Geralt|Where to now?
Yennefer|Wherever the leads take us.
Yennefer|Ready. Careful down there.
Geralt|Say we find the djinn, what'll you do?
Geralt|Ask for a beautiful house, then a palace, then a queen's crown?
Yennefer|Are we still talking about the djinn, or have we moved on to a talking fish?
Geralt|Doesn't much matter. Both make wishes come true.
Geralt|What would yours be?
Yennefer|You'll learn in due course.
Yennefer|Find anything?
Yennefer|Esad eich crydae rhythaun!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Found a wreck. It's been here a while. Wood's rotted.
Yennefer|Look around, but be careful. Look for something that might indicate it's the mage's ship.
Geralt|Got something. A Skelliger's buckler. Clan Heymaey symbols.
Yennefer|Donar's clan.
Geralt|Donar was a babe in swaddling clothes when this buckler landed here.
Geralt|Longship belonged to Clan Dimun.
Geralt|Men from Faroe attacked this ship.
Geralt|A man's skeleton… Somebody pinned his skull to the deck with an axe.
Yennefer|A death worthy of a Skelliger.
Geralt|Clan emblem indicates a Dimun man. So he was from Faroe.
Geralt|Arrows stuck in the side. The kind Faroe folk use.
Geralt|Got a chest, really old. Must've fell off the wrecked longship.
Yennefer|Can you open it?
Geralt|Hoping for pirate treasure?
Yennefer|I hope to find the djinn. Try to open it.
Geralt|Now that's what I call war booty…
Yennefer|Have you found the djinn?
Geralt|No. But I found something that could be just as valuable to me, as the djinn is to you.
Geralt|Beautiful craftsmanship…
Yennefer|What do you have?
Geralt|A war horn. Bearing Clan Heymaey symbols.
Geralt|Yen, doubt any of these boats were the mage's. These are old sunken longships.
Yennefer|Come back, then. We must search elsewhere.
<|endoftext|>
Yennefer|Something strange about those rocks…
Geralt|And there's something on the bottom. I'll see what it is.
Yennefer|See something?
Geralt|"Something" doesn't do it justice. A huge crater, as if a meteorite landed here.
Yennefer|I must see it.
Geralt|Diving in after all?
Yennefer|No, I shall cast another spell. To see through your eyes. Now relax.
Yennefer|Eys'u failte beydem aen eich'te llyvaid.
Yennefer|That is no meteorite crater…
Geralt|What is it, then?
Yennefer|The effect of teleportation. A powerful force cut out a fragment of the sea bed, rocks and everything lying within the teleportation zone.
Geralt|Always claimed portals were dangerous.
Yennefer|I believe we're on the right track. Look for anything that might contain a djinn.
Geralt|Fine, but get outta my eyes. Too cramped in here for us both.
Geralt|No djinn here, but there's something you oughta like.
Yennefer|What?
Geralt|Half a seal.
Yennefer|That'll do. Come back up.
Geralt|Transverse cut through the pelvis. Surgical precision. No conventional weapon could do this.
Geralt|But whatever cut the basket probably could.
Geralt|Hmm… Something cut this basket exactly in half.
Geralt|Bet it was cut by the same thing that cut the skeleton.
Geralt|Silver, pearl-encrusted cutlery… Ship belonged to someone awfully wealthy.
Yennefer|Amos was no pauper. It could very well be his ship.
Yennefer|Geralt, sirens!
<|endoftext|>
Yennefer|…Three.
Geralt|Said you were gonna go on three.
Yennefer|I did.
Yennefer|Look. We must search the area.
Geralt|Yen, not so fast. Gotta tell me what this is about first. Why do you want this djinn?
Yennefer|But you already know. A djinn's power is priceless to a mage.
Geralt|Won't worm your way out of it, not this time. Tell me the truth, or I'll leave.
Yennefer|You needn't resort to blackmail. You would've learned, eventually.
Geralt|True. But after the fact. I want to know now.
Yennefer|Ahh… How long has this been going on, Geralt? This thing between us? Fifteen, twenty years?
Yennefer|We repeatedly split up, then return to one another… Something draws us to each other. But I can never be certain if it's a true feeling, or merely a bit of mischief by a djinn.
Geralt|So that's it… This is about my last wish.
Yennefer|You asked that djinn to bind us together forever. I want to ask this one to take that wish back.
Geralt|Why would you want to do that?
Yennefer|To see what it's like without it. To see if we'll still matter to one another, or if we'll be like two strangers.
Geralt|Hm… Wondered that myself many times…
Yennefer|You see? We're just a step away from learning the truth.
Yennefer|Come, let's search the ship.
Geralt|What if I don't want to know?
Yennefer|I'm afraid you no longer have a choice.
Geralt|I get it. You wanna know what'll happen if magic no longer binds us…
Yennefer|I want to know, if when the djinn's magic is gone, if we've any magic left of our own.
Geralt|That I know, but I also want to know how you plan to use it. Wouldn't go to these lengths if it wasn't something important.
Yennefer|You're right. It's important… Even very important.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Seems Amos was quite the eccentric. Asking the djinn to lift half his ship to a mountaintop?
Yennefer|He didn't necessarily. Djinns are inherently mischievous, this one might've granted his wish and perverted it in doing so.
Geralt|In that case, I'd appreciate it if you didn't wish I'd disappear from your life.
Yennefer|I've yet to decide how to word it.
Geralt|Looks like a laboratory.
Geralt|Mage must've slept here.
Geralt|"Elemental Empires" - by Gianbattista.
Geralt|"Mystery of Mysteries" - Agnes of Glanville.
Geralt|Nice shoes. Looks like the impact with the mountain was so powerful, it popped the wearer right out of them.
Geralt|Cold's preserved the corpse… Hm… Died from head trauma, bookcase cracked his skull.
Geralt|Must've been a hard landing atop this mountain.
Geralt|Blood… Someone was dragged across the deck or left this mark when the ship suddenly tipped to one side.
<|endoftext|>
Yennefer|It's Amos. Looks exactly like the etching in the book. Except his head was intact there.
Geralt|If he died while being teleported, seal might still be on him…
Geralt|Behold!
Yennefer|Bravo. Come to the deck, I've an idea.
Geralt|Think the djinn did this to him?
Yennefer|No, it wouldn't attack its master. This looks rather like an unfortunate accident.
Yennefer|When the storm broke, Amos must've uttered a wish like, "Take us away, anywhere, to a mountaintop, even." And the djinn granted the wish literally.
Yennefer|They had a hard landing, Amos was thrown off his feet and against the wall. The bookcase did the rest.
Geralt|Always knew too much studying could kill you.
Geralt|Yen, think you should see this.
Yennefer|What do you have?
<|endoftext|>
Yennefer|Got you!
Yennefer|Your master died before uttering his last wish! I cannot capture you!
Yennefer|We can struggle like this for eternity, or I can release you! If you do one thing for me!
Djinn|Grraghh!
Yennefer|Do you see the spell that binds us?
Djinn|Graug!
Yennefer|Only a djinn can remove another djinn's spell! Remove this one, and you'll be free!
Djinn|Aaauuutree neyyyvanaaaath!
Yennefer|You are free!
Geralt|Storm's over.
Yennefer|Yes. It's all over.
Geralt|Maybe we should sit? You look a bit dazed…
Yennefer|I'm not. But we can sit.
Geralt|Feel any better?
Yennefer|I told you, I'm fine.
Geralt|Don't need to play tough for me. That was a hard fight. Maybe not as hard as the last time we tamed a djinn, but still…
Yennefer|Hmh! No comparison, I'm afraid. Half of Rinde suffered then. Now I'm merely a bit tired…
Yennefer|Thank you for coming, Geralt. I'd have had a much harder time of it on my own.
Geralt|Well, never could say no to you.
Yennefer|Mhm… perhaps that will change now.
Geralt|Feel anything? That anything's… different?
Yennefer|Hmm… I expected… I don't know what I expected, actually. A bit of vertigo, perhaps.
Yennefer|I thought… you'd become a stranger to me… That I'd look at you and not feel a thing…
Yennefer|But it's not like that at all. Nothing's changed.
Geralt|Djinn mighta cheated us after all…
Yennefer|Why?
Geralt|Cause I don't feel that anything's changed, either.
Geralt|I love you, Yen.
Yennefer|And I love you.
Geralt|Ow! What was that?
Yennefer|It can't all be sweetness and light.
Geralt|Strange… Done that so many times, but… it felt like our first kiss to me.
Yennefer|It was, in a way. Besides… once you say "I love you," a kiss has to taste differently.
Geralt|Maybe we oughta test a few other things? Amos' cabin looked cozy…
Yennefer|Not so fast, Geralt. We'll have plenty of time to visit cozy cabins later.
Yennefer|But… I doubt the world will end if we sit here a while.
Yennefer|Ahh… My, it's lovely.
Geralt|Mhm. Think the spirits of Skellige favor us.
Geralt|What's next? Got any plans?
Yennefer|That depends what you mean… We must find Ciri, and then defeat the Hunt…
Geralt|Sorry, Yen. But… magic's gone for me.
Yennefer|Truly?
Yennefer|But… how is that possible? I still feel the same, you should too, I don't understand… What does this mean?
Geralt|Means the djinn granted your wish…
Yennefer|Right. Fine. Good. Glad we've got that over with. We know where we stand, at least.
Yennefer|Naught left for us here, let's go.
Geralt|Wait.
Geralt|Magic's gone, true, but that doesn't mean I don't like spending time with you.
Geralt|Let's sit a while.
Geralt|Not sure I'd have done it if I'd known what this was about from the start.
Yennefer|Then we'd never have learned the truth… Whether anything would change after the djinn removed the spell.
Geralt|Has it? Has anything changed?
Geralt|We've improved. Last time we tamed a djinn we destroyed half of Rinde.
Yennefer|Yes, we make a good team.
Yennefer|We should get back.
Yennefer|I'll take us to Kaer Trolde.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Next time we go on horseback.
Yennefer|A horse would never make it down that mountain.
Geralt|What now?
Yennefer|Well, I'm due to appear in Vizima.
Yennefer|I shall scour the palace library for something, anything that might help us determine who… or what the creature Skjall saw is.
Geralt|Kaer Morhen's got a pretty rich library.
Yennefer|I shall search that later. Besides… we really should report to the emperor.
Geralt|If we gotta, we gotta.
Yennefer|We wouldn't have known Ciri had returned if not for the emperor and his agents. It's the least we can do.
Geralt|Yen, what happened back there…
Yennefer|I'm off. See you, witcher… Somewhere on the Path.
Geralt|So long, Yen.
Yennefer|I'm off.
Geralt|Me too. I'll collect Uma from the baron, then we'll ride for Kaer Morhen.
Yennefer|I shall join you as quickly as I can. Farewell.
Yennefer|…was very nice. Let's not ruin it by hashing out the details.
Yennefer|I'll see you again soon.
Geralt|Take care of yourself.
Geralt|I'm going to see the baron. Collect Uma from him, then we'll ride for Kaer Morhen.
Yennefer|I shall join you as quickly as I can.
Geralt|See you, Yen. Take care of yourself.
Geralt|Fine… If you gotta go, go.
Yennefer|It shan't take long.
Geralt|Better not.
Geralt|Don't have the slightest intention of doing that.
Yennefer|Well. I can't force you..
Geralt|Awfully loyal to your patron…
Yennefer|He happens to be your patron as well, darling. You'd do well to remember that. Otherwise he might feel compelled to remind you.
Yennefer|We must report to the emperor, after all.
Geralt|Ciri's our concern, and only ours.
Yennefer|At heart, perhaps. But it's not what we agreed with Emhyr. We must see him.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Druid 01|We've offended him, Sven. The Woodland Spirit seeks revenge. This here is him saying we've strayed from the old paths.
Skellige Villager 06|Offended him? The monster's killed five already. He doesn't give a rat's arse about paths or tracks or me or you. He's a ploughin' beast from the ploughin' forest.
Geralt|Split his ribcage. A strong one, this spirit of yours.
Skellige Druid 01|That so? And who might you be?
Geralt|Geralt. I'm a witcher.
Skellige Druid 01|A killer for hire? What do you seek here?
Geralt|Just passing through, looking for work.
Skellige Druid 01|This village is home to decent folk only. You won't find any work here.
Geralt|Sure about that? Beast that did this - it's aggressive and incredibly strong. I can help you. For a price.
Skellige Villager 06|I like this man. Ply your trade, witcher. I believe we will agree terms.
Geralt|I've heard enough. You've got a monster problem, that's clear. Just not sure you want it solved.
Skellige Villager 06|Oh, we do. Come see me. We'll figure us a fair price for the beast's head.
Geralt|Our little talk while I looked over the corpse - not nearly enough. Need to look around, figure out what I'm up against.
Skellige Druid 01|Be not rash, killer. It's not too late to bring back the old ways.
Geralt|I'll decide what to do. But start collecting coin, just in case.
Geralt|You said the creature wants revenge. Why? For what?
Skellige Druid 01|Our forefathers hunted with spear and knife. This pleased the Woodland Spirit. He let us live in peace. We never knew hunger.
Skellige Villager 06|He killed back then, too, he's always killed. How many lads died trying to become hunters? Now, since our hunters died in the war, the beast's turned even more bloodthirsty.
Skellige Druid 01|We are an Craite! What others buy with gold, we buy with our lifeblood.
Skellige Villager 06|We are slaves to fear spread by blind fools like you. These woods are ours. High time we put an end to this beast.
Geralt|Who or what is this Woodland Spirit?
Skellige Druid 01|Tell you what it's not - any of your concern.
Skellige Villager 06|It's a common beast. Murders any man who ventures into its territory.
Geralt|Exhaustive as descriptions go. What does this Spirit look like? Anyone seen it for themselves?
Skellige Villager 06|No man alive has.
Geralt|Great. Really helpful, all of you.
Geralt|Birds pecked apart his entrails… And here - tooth marks - a large dog, a wolf maybe. This the way it always kills?
Skellige Druid 01|Only cowards. True warriors, men with the hearts of predators - the Spirit grants them an honorable death.
Geralt|Saw your notice.
Skellige Druid 01|What notice?
Geralt|I solve problems. And if we can agree terms, I can solve yours.
Skellige Druid 01|He's a witcher, a killer for hire.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Didn't have many friends, did he?
Skellige Druid 01|Folk aren't willing to look at this kind of death today, but in the past…
Skellige Druid 01|I remember… I was just a lad. Lugos Harelip led a raid on our village. Found nothing but silence and fog. I could barely make out my pa and my uncles, lyin' in wait behind the trees…
Skellige Druid 01|I remember how they hunted down one warrior after another. And once they surrounded Harelip himself… well, I believe he'd rather have faced the Woodland Spirit.
Geralt|Your Spirit is a very old leshen. He's dangerous, but I should be able to deal with him.
Skellige Druid 01|Rid us of him? Yet he's what made us invincible, turned us into great warriors.
Geralt|Back by the tree, you said you know another way to stop the leshen.
Skellige Druid 01|We must return to the old path, restore the old ways. Roam the woods with knife and spear. Fight on even terms and prove our valor. That would please him.
Skellige Druid 01|Our ancestors placed the Covenant Stone in the woods. Laid sacrifices of prized game on it and thus made a pact.
Skellige Druid 01|Do as they did. Go south, along the brook. Submit to the trial by burning a sacrifice of wolves' hearts on the sacred spot.
Geralt|Fine. I'll try it your way. But if it fails, I'll have to kill the beast.
Skellige Druid 01|Wise choice. The Spirit will subject you to trial. But you cannot succumb. Succeed in renewing the covenant and I'll spare no gold in rewarding you.
Geralt|There's no guarantee your method will work. And the risks are great. Probably easier to just kill the leshen.
Skellige Druid 01|If the Spirit dies, all game will leave the woods. Our men will lose their strength, and our women will be rendered barren. It will be the end of us all - that was our covenant.
Geralt|Still better than certain death.
Skellige Druid 01|You're not from here, you don't understand. Death is nothing to us, pride is everything.
Geralt|Gotta give this some thought. So long.
Geralt|Haven't decided what to do yet.
Skellige Druid 01|Try to kill the Woodland Spirit and you'll bring his wrath upon us all.
Geralt|Maybe I wasn't clear. The Woodland Spirit is a monster. Cut with a sword he'll bleed and die, like you, like me.
Skellige Druid 01|He's much more. Thanks to him the woods teem with game, and our women bear strong babes. The power of the Woodland Spirit makes us the best hunters in the Isles.
Skellige Druid 01|True, not every lad who sets out to be a hunter survives the sacred ritual. But aren't witchers made at similar cost?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Went to look at the tracks in the woods. Spirit sure knows how to make an impression on intruders.
Skellige Villager 06|Told you - he likes killing.
Geralt|Almost certain we're dealing with an old leshen.
Skellige Villager 06|An ordinary beast, then? Just as I said.
Geralt|Not so ordinary. Monster like that's a serious threat to the village. And to me, if you decide to hire me.
Skellige Villager 06|Oh, don't you fret - we'll have the gold.
Geralt|Just one small problem. The leshen's marked one of you. As long as that individual lives near its domain, the beast can't be killed, not completely. Sooner or later, it'll be reborn.
Skellige Villager 06|Must be one of the elders - Harald, I'm sure of it. You heard 'im.
Geralt|Words aren't enough. Gotta find the mark my way.
Skellige Villager 06|Folk won't believe you. They'd never listen to an outsider accusing one of their own. But you find the marked one, and I'll handle the rest.
Geralt|Mhm. I handle creatures like that, I know how. I can kill him for you, provided you have the coin.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|If you want me to kill the leshen, you gotta get rid of the marked one.
Skellige Villager 06|Do you hear the witcher, people?!
Skellige Villager 06|If we wanna live, we gotta slaughter the elders! No mercy!
Geralt|Never said the beast marked one of the elders.
Skellige Villager 06|Who, then?
Geralt|The woman you were talking to. Hilde.
Skellige Warrior 02|Kill the witch!
Skellige Villager 06|Hilde? But she's one of us.
Skellige Warrior 03|No mercy, Sven. We all heard you.
Skellige Villager 06|...Take her.
Geralt|Thought you liked the girl.
Skellige Villager 06|I did what I had to do. Your turn.
Geralt|The leshen's marked Hilde.
Skellige Villager 06|Hildie?
Geralt|No one needs to die. The marked one should leave the village, that's enough. If they never return, the leshen'll never be reborn.
Skellige Villager 06|Did you hear what the witcher said? We've but to banish the elders to have peace for all time!
Geralt|It's not one of the elders.
Skellige Villager 06|Who, then?
Geralt|The woman you were talking to.
Skellige Warrior 02|We must banish her. Said so yourself.
Skellige Villager 06|But… she's one of us!
Skellige Warrior 03|For the good of the village, Sven.
Skellige Villager 06|...Drive her out. Make sure she knows she's not to return. Ever.
Geralt|Not going with her? Funny, thought you cared for her.
Skellige Villager 06|Tend to your own affairs and leave me to mine.
Skellige Villager 06|I did what I had to do. Now it's your turn.
Geralt|Killing the leshen won't be easy. Stay out of my way while I hunt.
Geralt|Go to your homes, stay inside. If I don't come back, send someone to Kaer Trolde.
Skellige Villager 06|We'll do as you say. Don't let us down, witcher.
Geralt|The leshen's marked Hilde.
Skellige Villager 06|Hilde?
Skellige Villager 06|So? Find out who's mates with the beast?
Geralt|It's not intentional, the marked individual has no idea.
Skellige Villager 06|You don't know the elders like I do. Every last one of them codgers would surrender his mother to please the monster.
Skellige Villager 06|And no point in mincin' words. Said yourself, the monster's helper must die first.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Villager 06|Hey! Hey, look at this! Told you the witcher'd solve this!
Geralt|What happened?
Skellige Villager 06|You rid us of the beast, we rid ourselves of its accomplices.
Skellige Villager 06|Don't worry, our agreement stands. Earned your coin, you did.
Geralt|Nothing's changed. Leshen's gone, true, but a murderer still haunts the village.
Skellige Villager 06|Your work is done, witcher. You've done your part, and I've done mine.
Geralt|Think the village will go along with this?
Skellige Villager 06|Folk will calm down, realize the guilty needed to be punished.
Skellige Villager 06|D'you hear?! Fear will not rule my village! There will be no more killings! Go to your homes!
Skellige Villager 06|And you, witcher - on your way! No more monsters left around here.
Geralt|Argh. You people aren't worth the trouble.
Skellige Villager 06|Don't understand a thing, do you, witcher? Guess you don't need to. Killing monsters - that's what you're good for.
Skellige Villager 06|So best be on your way, 'cause there's no monsters left 'round here!
Geralt|Peasant squabbles - just not interested.
Skellige Villager 06|Oh, wise words. You're not from here, you can't understand.
Skellige Villager 06|What're you staring at, people?! Justice has been served! Go to your homes!
Skellige Villager 06|And you, witcher - on your way. No monsters left 'round here.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|The leshen accepted my offering.
Skellige Druid 01|I saw the smoke rise and crows dance in the sky. Everything will return to the old ways.
Geralt|You'll see in a few days. I've done my part.
Skellige Druid 01|Expecting coin, eh? Don't fret, I've got your gold.
Skellige Druid 01|Take it. You've earned every last bit.
Geralt|You do know young boys will continue to die at the Covenant Stone, trying to become hunters. The killing'll never end.
Skellige Druid 01|I've not paid you to lecture me. You've done your job. It's time you left.
Skellige Warrior 01|Well, well, Harald. Paying the witcher behind our backs to sod off and let the monster live.
Skellige Warrior 03|We finished off the other elders. Just one left.
Skellige Druid 01|Pffft. Death's but another stage in the cycle. I embrace it.
Skellige Villager 06|Begone, witcher. And you can keep your coin.
Geralt|Think murder will change something?
Skellige Villager 06|You've done your part, got your coin, what are you waitin' for?! No monsters left around here.
Geralt|I won't let you kill him.
Skellige Villager 06|The witcher first! Get him!
Geralt|You deserve each other.
Skellige Warrior 01|Heh, you're one to judge.
Skellige Villager 06|Know your place, witcher. You've dealt with the beast. Time you were on your way.
Geralt|Nothing will change, no matter what you do here.
Skellige Villager 06|We'll find out for ourselves. You see, it's our fate on the line here. You? You're just passing through.
Geralt|Take care.
Skellige Druid 01|On your way, killer.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Nice place.
Succubus 01|A witcher?! Are you after me, you've a contract?
Geralt|No. Found this place by accident.
Succubus 01|Mhm. Want something?
Geralt|This man - who is he?
Succubus 01|My lover. Or rather one of my many. I usually chase them away once I'm done with them… But I let this one stay - he doesn't snore.
Geralt|What's with all the flowers?
Succubus 01|I shall make honey, like the forest succubus I am, silly.
Succubus 01|What do you think they're for? They're pretty! Monsters have aesthetic preferences, too, you know.
Succubus 01|If you see one that you fancy, please take it. I like to share.
Geralt|Farewell.
Succubus 01|You again? What do you want?
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Druid 02|Yes? What do you seek?
Geralt|Kind old geezer I just saw you talking to - who was he?
Skellige Druid 02|One of our circle. Gremist. An exceptional alchemist… but a stubborn, mean ass.
Geralt|Well, been around sorceresses my share. Long enough to know that with great enlightenment comes even greater arrogance.
Skellige Druid 02|But sorceresses welcome apprentices, am I right? Not Gremist. So many formulae in that head, so many methods of ingesting and absorbing lethal toxins… But he'd rather take them to the grave than share!
Geralt|Maybe he'll make an exception, share them with me?
Skellige Druid 02|As likely as mistletoe sprouting from right here.
Geralt|Why's he averse to having an apprentice?
Skellige Druid 02|How should I know… Perhaps because he's a stubborn, mean ass?
Geralt|Farewell.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Wanna talk to you.
Gremista|But I do not wish to speak. Leave, you distress me.
Geralt|I want you to share your knowledge, teach me alchemy.
Gremista|You? My apprentice? Haha, that's rich. While you're at it, why don't you ask Udalryk if he'll share Spikeroog with ye?!
Geralt|I'm serious.
Gremista|Is that so? Don't make me laugh. I've devoted my life to alchemy, son. Literally. Spent countless days and nights with nothing but alembics, choking on fumes, scorching my skin with acids…
Gremista|If you think I'll simply betray to you what I learned through years of sacrifice and toil… then you are mistaken. Deeply.
Geralt|Can I convince you somehow?
Gremista|Oh gods… You're as bothersome as a gadfly before a storm.
Gremista|Hmm. Though I am preparing to perform a rather tricky ritual, so I could use some help… Even yours. I require three favors. Do them for me, and I shall accept you as my apprentice.
Geralt|Well well. There's a way after all.
Gremista|Get off your high horse and listen. First, you must bring me a pimpernel from the Morskogen Forest. Second, I need a bottle of spirit from the old distillery on Hail Hill.
Gremista|Finally, convince Fritjof to help me perform the rite. He's a druid, like I am. You'll find him near Blandare. I believe he's there on a matter of some import. So, what will it be?
Geralt|All right, I'll do it. But this ritual you wanna perform - what's that about?
Gremista|If you wish to be my apprentice you must stop asking questions. I decide what to tell you and when to do it. Now go. Chop chop, before I change my mind!
Geralt|This Fritjof - who is he?
Gremista|A vaedermakar - hah! You don't know the word, do you? And I pledged to make you my apprentice?
Gremista|A vaedermakar is a druid who can manipulate the weather. Stop a storm, cause hail, make lightning turn your enemy to ash. I advise to address him with the utmost respect… if you value your life.
Geralt|Spirit - why do you need that?
Gremista|As you must know, potential apprentice, alcohol is the base for all potions. Superior alcohol means a higher quality potion. This spirit… has no equal. Its strength, its… flavor - ahh.
Gremista|Unfortunately, the distillery atop Hail Hill has fallen into disrepair - we've lacked a source ever since. But you'll manage somehow, won't you? You're so confident.
Geralt|Hm. A pimpernel. Far as I know it's got no use in alchemy apart from…
Gremista|Would you teach your grandmother to suck eggs? It's not any pimpernel, but the one that grows in the Morskogen Forest. And if the rumors are true, a creature jealously guards all the herbs growing there.
Geralt|Forest creature jealously guarding some secrets? Sounds familiar.
Geralt|Not all that jealously. I've met it… or rather her. She gave me a pimpernel.
Gremista|Well now, not only do you parley with monsters, you can read my mind as well. We might make an alchemist of you yet…
Geralt|You're asking a lot. Let me think about it, figure out if helping you's worth the trouble.
Geralt|Farewell.
Geralt|I'd be a good student.
Gremista|Doubtful! You can't even grasp the simple notion that I want you to leave.
Geralt|Fine… Won't ask again.
Gremista|Splendid resolution. I hope you have the resolve to keep it.
Gremista|Yes, yes. You mentioned it before. And my reply remains unchanged - no.
Geralt|You seem a nice enough guy.
Gremista|Well, I'm not. And plan never to be.
Gremista|I became a druid to avoid others, to not to have to deal with 'em. Not to smile when I don't wish to. To feign compassion when someone's travails matter less to me than a pair of birch cones.
Gremista|So I shall be straight: get out of my sight. Before something - I know not what - deprives you of yours.
Geralt|Mhm. Farewell, then.
Gremista|I've told you what you must do. Why do you still bother me?
Geralt|Wanted to ask you something…
Gremista|Not only are you as ugly as a toad, but you have the memory of a goldfish. Well, what is it?
Gremista|Either agree to help me or leave.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Druid 05|Ah… another seeker of pimpernel?
Geralt|Another?
Skellige Druid 05|Gremist has sent countless young druids into the forest. They emerge drained, with a blank stare… and with no flower. And they never speak of what happened.
Skellige Druid 05|I've asked Gremist to stop the folly. He looked at me and laughed. But the fun's over.
Skellige Druid 05|One of our novices, Ramund, has failed to return. I've come to find him. Alive or dead.
Geralt|Listen, you're looking for a druid, I'm looking for a flower… Let's go in together.
Skellige Druid 05|Why not… I could use the help of a tracker. Lead the way.
Geralt|What do you know about this forest?
Skellige Druid 05|Not much. Funny, isn't it? A druid should know every tree, every bush…
Skellige Druid 05|But even we know not to venture to some parts of the isle. We can subdue animals, but not monsters… And the word is one has made its lair here.
Geralt|A leshen? An axibrun?
Skellige Druid 05|Sadly, I don't know. As I said - those who have entered do not speak of who or what they saw.
Geralt|Think I know what drained your novices. See, there's a succubus in the forest.
Skellige Druid 05|A succubus?! Gremist must have known. Yet he still sent those lads here? He risked their lives for what - a prank?
Geralt|I doubt they hold it against him.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Villager 03|Hoho! No no, hoho, stop, please! Haha! Hoho, this is great. No-o! No! Stop! Ahh, please!
Skellige Villager 03|Stop it, that tickles! Hohoho! Two can play at this game you horny goat woman.
Skellige Druid 05|Unhand him, hellish creature! Ramund! Step away from her!
Skellige Villager 03|Ah, calm down! I've not been harmed! I came here--
Skellige Druid 05|You don't know what you're saying. She's cast a spell on you!
Succubus 01|Nonsense. I need no spell. These boys come 'ere themselves. In fact, I must use magic to drive them away, make them go home! Only Ramund was nice, so I let him stay.
Skellige Druid 05|I see through your lies - your wretched charm won't work on me! I shall kill you here and now, monster!
Geralt|Met a lot of succubi on the Path. None set out to hurt anyone, but they all killed, eventually. Lost themselves when feeding, drained their lovers dry of life force.
Skellige Villager 03|Not her, she's different!
Geralt|Out of my way. And don't interfere.
Geralt|I don't see any reason to kill her. She's a monster, sure… but a sentient one, and basically harmless.
Skellige Druid 05|No such thing - just as there's no dry water, no cold fire. But if you'll not help, very well, I shall tend to her myself.
Geralt|I'd advise against it.
Skellige Druid 05|I will return. With one who does not carry a sword for show.
Succubus 01|Why did you take my side? I'm afraid you'll be sorely disappointed - I don't generally couple with witchers, especially not out of gratitude.
Geralt|Can think of another way you can repay me. I'm looking for pimpernel. You know this forest. Maybe you could help me?
Succubus 01|I shall take you myself… And you, Ramund, go pick some more violets. Just the indigo ones this time!
Skellige Villager 03|Indigo… You mean blue?
Succubus 01|No. Indigo is indigo.
Succubus 01|Ahh, men…
Geralt|Tell me why not. Is it the scars?
Succubus 01|I detest when a man smells of blood. You witchers always reek of it. Fiend blood, chort blood - and these are my brethren.
Geralt|You're right. But unlike fiends and chorts, you--
Succubus 01|Have ample breasts and a pretty face? I know. Their lack of these attributes - is that what makes them easy to kill?
Geralt|It's a bit more complicated than that… But never mind. No means no - I get it.
Succubus 01|Witcher, you've been here! You saw! Ramund's not been harmed in any way!
Skellige Druid 05|We saw what happens to those who land in this beast's embrace! We saw Jorre's body!
Succubus 01|Then you saw I buried his body as custom dictates! I did not seek his death. He… He was very old, his heart was weak. I warned him it could end that way… But he kept returning!
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Villager 03|What… What have you done?!
Skellige Druid 05|We saved you, Ramund.
Skellige Villager 03|The hell you did! She'd never hurt me! Never!
Geralt|Really believe that?
Geralt|Succubi feed on human energy. Lose that and it means death, eventually.
Skellige Villager 03|Life leads to death, eventually! You're murderers! Go to hell!
Skellige Druid 05|Incredible. We risked our lives to find him - now we're the monsters?
Geralt|Happens a lot more often than you think… Now if you'll excuse me, I gotta find that damn flower. Any idea where there might be pimpernel?
Skellige Druid 05|You saw the forest - not a daisy or a kingcup in sight. I'd say it's her doing. She took them, gathered them… somewhere nearby.
Skellige Druid 05|Farewell, witcher. Thank you for your help. And good luck!
Geralt|Maybe not you, but she'd kill someone eventually, that's certain.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|You Fritjof?
Skellige Druid 04|That's right. And what do they call you, witcher?
Geralt|Me? Drifter, stranger, mutant… Sometimes even by my name. Geralt of Rivia.
Skellige Druid 04|Hah! A man with a sense of humor. I like that. Well, what can I do for you, Geralt of Rivia?
Geralt|Gremist wanted me to summon you. Needs you to help him perform a ritual.
Skellige Druid 04|A ritual? Will this one stop him from being a mean old goat? I would go see him, for old time's sake, but I've more important matters on my mind.
Skellige Druid 04|Look about you. The ground - see how dry it is? It's not rained for weeks. The grass in pastures has withered, sheep are starving. I must bring rain, but fear that--
Skellige Druid 04|Wait just a moment! Perhaps you could help me?
Geralt|How? I'm a man of many talents, but manipulating the weather's not one of them.
Skellige Druid 04|I have in mind a different skill, involving your sword. You see, Mother Nature dislikes it when you take something from her by force. She will defend herself. So fiercely, in fact, that I could use a defender myself. What do you say?
Geralt|Sure, I'll help. Provided you go see Gremist afterwards.
Skellige Druid 04|Agreed. Now follow me. Time for a little storm.
Geralt|Gimme a minute… Need to prepare.
Geralt|Nothing at the moment. I'll come back later.
Skellige Druid 04|Yes, Geralt?
Skellige Druid 04|May I count on your help, Geralt?
Geralt|Can we give it another shot? Please?
Skellige Druid 04|We must, I suppose. But this time… do please make an effort.
Skellige Druid 04|So… May we begin? Same terms as last time?
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Druid 04|I've not managed a storm that fine for ages. Did you see the drops? The size of eggs!
Geralt|A little busy tending to the foglets. They weren't small, either.
Skellige Druid 04|Ah yes, unfortunately, they always emerge. But perhaps that's for the best…
Geralt|Will you go see Gremist now?
Skellige Druid 04|With pleasure. After a storm of those proportions I shall gladly have a-- uuh, help him with his ritual. Till then!
Geralt|For the best? Why?
Skellige Druid 04|If manipulating the weather carried no risks, they'd not give me peace. Make it rain, make the sun shine. Some would want storms, others a sea calm as a pond frozen over…
Skellige Druid 04|This way folk petition me only when their need is great, not because they've had a whim.
Geralt|I get it. There're times I wish I didn't have to chase this nekker or that drowner…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Distilling recipes. Parchment's a little faded, but legible.
Geralt|Wooden parts have rotted, metal's tarnished, dust everywhere. Doesn't seem to be broken, though.
Geralt|Must be the filter.
Geralt|Oughta be enough. Time to cool it down.
Geralt|Well well… Turns out I'm quite the distiller.
Geralt|Got lucky. Bit of mash left.
Geralt|Cyclops won't bother me anymore. Can look around peacefully now.
Geralt|Now to boil the mash.
Geralt|Ugh… Breath's downright flammable…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Did everything you asked.
Gremista|Phenomenal, my boy. So, Fritjof, shall we begin?
Skellige Druid 04|The sooner the better. We've a long night ahead of us.
Gremista|The ritual is only for members of the Inner Circle. Thus, my dear apprentice, you must wait outside. Under no circumstances must you to enter! We shall begin your tutelage come morn.
Geralt|Will you finally tell me what the ritual's about?
Gremista|Now now. No one likes a meddler. Suffice to say it's… a burning matter. Now shoo!
Geralt|As you wish, Master.
Gremista|Hah! We'll make someone out of you yet, witcher. Now off with you, shoo!
Skellige Druid 04|Ah! I must have another. That'sh good shtuff!
Gremista|Aye, idz the best! From Morskogen. And spir't from Hail Hill! Good times, Fritjof, hahaha, good times. Finally, somethin' other than damn potions and transhutations!
Geralt|Guess the ritual's not over yet.
Gremista|Geralt! I thought I told you to ssh-shtay outshide! Only druids of the Inner Circle…!
Skellige Druid 04|Cricle-shmircle! Let the boy have shome fun. He's earned it.
Gremista|Hehe, fine! Pour yourshelf shome. Geralt, let the lesshons begin!
Geralt|Don't you think you oughta sober up first?
Gremista|Ahh, once I'm shober, we'll get nowhere on account of my hangover. Now shit!
Gremista|Hehehehe right… Let's shtart with ingesting toxins. Best approach - practice makes perfect.
Geralt|Mhm. I've practiced a lot already - good thing.
Gremista|It'll make learning my shecret methodsh eashier. Look… You take the potion like thish… And gulp!
Geralt|Drink hard and study hard. I like the idea.
Gremista|Yeah, yeah… I call it stimulation and assimilation. First you stimulate, and then - hahaa - you assimilate. Now shit down.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Why you need all these flowers?
Succubus 01|Nosy, aren't you? Wait and see.
Succubus 01|Pretty, don't you think? Bellflowers, violets, kingcups, pimpernels… I must pick some edelweiss.
Succubus 01|Take one. But no more! I've put a lot of work into making this cavern cozy.
Succubus 01|Now shoo! I await someone.
Geralt|Flower… No petals…
Geralt|There were flowers here as well. But they've been picked. Every last one.
Geralt|Hoof prints. But a biped's.
Geralt|Someone buried him. Not skillfully… But with great care.
Geralt|Lots of scratches… None look lethal, though. Body's dried out as if it was drained.
Skellige Druid 05|I know him. It's Jorre the White of Kaer Trolde… He died far from home.
Geralt|Footprints. Some fresh, others faded. All leading in the same direction.
Geralt|Pollen on the leaves still. Someone picked the bloom… recently.
Skellige Druid 05|No… Unlikely that he ventured out so far. We're going the wrong way!
Skellige Druid 05|I'll not trail you all over Skellige. I shall return where the trail begins!
Skellige Druid 05|Well? Prepared to help me find Ramund now?
Geralt|Sure. Let's go.
Geralt|Maybe later. Got more important matters on my mind.
Skellige Druid 05|What a grotesque creature.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Villager 05|Look what the sea hurled ashore… Hey, you! What clan you from?
Geralt|No clan. I'm from the Continent.
Skellige Villager 06|Skellige warriors alone drink in this tavern.
Geralt|Not looking for trouble.
Skellige Villager 06|Ha. Look at 'im! Raise your voice and his tail slinks between his legs. Like a dog who's heard a wolf howl at the moon.
Skellige Villager 05|Lookin' to eat? Wait out in the yard, then, till Ilge tosses what's left in our bowls o'er the fence.
Jorund|Whosoever denies shelter to a traveler disgraces himself and brings shame on his clan. Your das teach you nothin'?
Skellige Villager 05|Don't you talk to me about me da, Jorund, or I'll tuck you in 'neath a barrow.
Skellige Villager 06|And you remember this, stranger - this here's not Kaer Trolde, and we's not an Craite. Guests are not welcome.
Geralt|You don't mind the occasional traveler?
Jorund|I mind fools. No matter where they're from.
Geralt|Geralt of Rivia. Witcher.
Jorund|Jorund, son of Sigvald. If you've no one to drink with, sit down with me. Share some mead and a tale.
Geralt|Didn't need any help.
Jorund|Anyone with half an eye and an ounce o' sense could see that. Was savin' them, not you.
Geralt|Why're you here, then? Don't look like warriors to me. More like shepherds.
Skellige Villager 06|Every Skelliger's a warrior. Even him born in a sheep shack.
Skellige Villager 05|But we don't expect you to understand. Every man's a thrall on the Continent, cringin' afore his master like a mongrel whinin' for scraps 'neath the table.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Old Man 04|Had but two sons. And you killed 'em. You ended my line.
Geralt|Sorry. But I didn't start it.
Skellige Old Man 04|Does this stranger speak the truth? Who first drew a blade?
Skellige Villager 01|Dunno. It happened fast, and we were a few horns in…
Geralt|You lie. You saw who started it, had to.
Skellige Old Man 04|I'd sooner believe one of our own. Men who know what honor is.
Geralt|Don't want any more bloodshed. But I'll defend myself if I have to.
Skellige Old Man 04|You'll make your defense before the jarl. Only if Madman Lugos calls you innocent, will you be free to go.
Geralt|I'm to be judged by somebody you yourselves call "Madman"?
Skellige Villager 01|That, or fight the whole village. And you'll never defeat us all, not with three swords you won't.
Geralt|Fine. Lead the way.
Geralt|Your sons showed no respect for the law. If not for Jorund, something would've happened first time around…
Skellige Old Man 04|There's a blodsfejd 'tween Jorund's family and mine. Makes no difference what he did or said.
Geralt|I killed the monster from the lighthouse, the beast that haunted you. This how you repay me?
Skellige Villager 01|Paid you in gold. We owe you nothin' more.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|When's my trial?
Skellige Guard 04|When the jarl summons ye. Won't be soon.
Skellige Guard 04|The longer a man crushes rocks, the less eager he is to give lip durin' trial.
Skellige Guard 04|This one's waited a year. That one - three.
Geralt|But see, Lugos said my trial'd be today. Don't remember?
Skellige Guard 04|Oh, aye… Right… Come on…
Geralt|I don't have that much time. Looking for someone and--
Skellige Guard 04|Couldn't give a sheep's arse. Grab a pickaxe and get workin'.
Geralt|Listen, maybe we can make a deal. They took my things, but…
Skellige Guard 04|Y'aren't on the Continent. Can't buy me - not with gold, not with honors.
Geralt|All right. I've heard enough.
Skellige Guard 04|Get to work, then. Grab a pickaxe, earn your next meal.
Geralt|Got any idea who you're dealing with?
Skellige Guard 04|I've heard. You're Geralt of Rivia. A witcher.
Geralt|Known also as the Butcher of Blaviken.
Skellige Guard 04|Aye, and now you're the Jailrat of Arinbjorn. You don't scare me.
Skellige Guard 04|You bored? Grab a pickaxe.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Well? What do you want?
Skellige Old Man 02|To help you, drifter.
Geralt|Know how to escape?
Skellige Old Man 02|Escape? Nay. But there's other ways out - I can ensure Lugos'll try you today.
Skellige Old Man 02|You'll be free sooner… or go under the axe. Either way, out today.
Geralt|Go on.
Skellige Old Man 02|Owes me a favor, one of the guards. I can get 'im to take you to Lugos… Then you can owe me a favor. Whaddaya say?
Geralt|Sounds good.
Skellige Old Man 02|Tell the guard to take you to Lugos. Tell him he does that, Simun'll forget what happened at Fyresdal.
Geralt|They say every prisoner's got a secret. But you, Simun, seems to me you've got a bundle.
Geralt|Fine. I'll do as you say.
Geralt|So what happened at Fyresdal?
Skellige Old Man 02|None o' your concern. Just go to him, repeat what I said.
Geralt|If you can get the guard to do that, why're you still in here?
Skellige Old Man 02|Argh, you don't know Simun Brambling.
Skellige Old Man 02|Many seek my death. I'm safe from their vengeance here… And the time for mine's not yet ripe.
Geralt|Rather not be anyone's debtor.
Skellige Old Man 02|Prefer bein' a prisoner, then? As you will.
Geralt|Think I'll manage on my own.
Skellige Old Man 02|Or you'll be back.
Skellige Old Man 02|Psst! Whitehair! C'mere!
Skellige Old Man 02|Look at 'im cast his eyes about, searching for an escape. But there ain't none to be found - heh! - save for talkin' to old Simun.
Skellige Old Man 02|You're back. Like I said you'd be.
Skellige Old Man 02|So what'll it be? A favor for a favor?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Rather talk. About what happened at Fyresdal, for example.
Skellige Guard 04|Shut it!
Geralt|It'll cost you. Scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.
Skellige Guard 04|How the hell did you know about it?
Geralt|From Simun Brambling. He promised to forget if you take me to see the jarl.
Skellige Guard 04|Bramblin'! More like Simun Loose-lip. Ah, fine, come with me.
Geralt|Hey, good folk! Wanna hear what our brave guard did at Fyresdal?
Skellige Guard 04|Shut your trap, dammit!
Skellige Guard 04|Four against one - and you came out alive.
Skellige Guard 04|Shame to let such a lad waste away behind bars… Come on. Maybe Lugos'll try you today.
Geralt|And they say violence is never the answer…
<|endoftext|>
Lugos The Mad|Geralt… Didn't think I'd see you again so soon.
Lugos The Mad|I don't remember sendin' for you.
Geralt|Wouldn't mind waiting if I had a free year or two. Sadly, I'm in a hurry.
Lugos The Mad|Let's get to it. Leif claims you killed his sons, Kori and Kraki. What do you say to that?
Geralt|Fought to defend myself. And Jorund.
Skellige Old Man 04|None came forth to confirm your words.
Geralt|And none will. Always easier to hang an outsider than to try one of your own, right?
Lugos The Mad|Hah! Tongue as sharp as your blades!
Skellige Old Man 04|Sharp? He insults me, Jarl. Insults our whole clan. The codex of ancestors says--
Lugos The Mad|Quiet. I've made my decision.
Lugos The Mad|Geralt of Rivia, I find ye guilty on two counts of murder. Punishment's death by suffocation.
Lugos The Mad|But you can buy your way out. By payin' Kori's and Kraki's weight in silver.
Geralt|You know I don't have that kinda coin. Unless those boys were a lot lighter than they looked.
Lugos The Mad|I'm well aware o' that.
Lugos The Mad|I'll pay the blood price meself.
Skellige Old Man 04|What?! That's against every law!
Lugos The Mad|I make the laws here.
Lugos The Mad|Go home, Leif. 'Cause if ye rile me, I'll tie this bag o' silver 'round your neck and toss ye in the sea.
Geralt|Nice gesture. Though I'm guessing it doesn't come free.
Lugos The Mad|Tell me, witcher. Have you any honor?
Geralt|I do.
Lugos The Mad|I paid Leif on your behalf. That puts you in my debt, a debt of pride. You ought to do as I say. So, listen carefully.
Lugos The Mad|My lad, Blueboy Lugos - he's ventured out. But not against the Black Ones nor to loot a convent. Got the notion to go to the Cave of Dreams, south side of the isle - and none return from there.
Lugos The Mad|You're clever and good with a sword, two traits that rarely go together. So you're to help him. I need an heir… no matter his mettle.
Lugos The Mad|Take your things and do as I say - or lose your dignity and good name for all time.
Geralt|Why the theatrics? If you wanted to hire a witcher, should've just said so. Would've been cheaper.
Lugos The Mad|Well, why do ye stand there and stare? You're free. Take your things and piss off.
Geralt|Gladly. But tell me… To what do I owe this act of... mercy?
Lugos The Mad|You helped my son in the Cave of Dreams, so I owed you. But… kill anyone else from Arinbjorn, I'll break your neck with me own hands and hang ye over me hearth.
Geralt|Lemme pay in installments. Witchers live long. Daresay I'll pay it off, eventually - end of the next century or so.
Lugos The Mad|I've a better idea.
Geralt|They got what they deserved.
Skellige Old Man 04|How dare ye?! My lads--
Geralt|Were arrogant little shits who were looking for a fight. Picked on the wrong guy.
Geralt|Save us all some time. Verdict was clear before I walked in. I'm a foreigner, so I'm guilty.
Lugos The Mad|How 'bout that - not just a fighter, but a fortune teller as well.
Geralt|You invited me to your lands, Lugos. Said I'd find work here..
Lugos The Mad|Aye… Killin' monsters, not men.
Lugos The Mad|The very devil we speak of. Never thought we'd meet so soon.
Skellige Old Man 04|But he's a vagrant. A foreigner. He don't deserve a trial, not even death by the sword. He--
Geralt|No, go on. I wanna hear this.
Skellige Old Man 04|My line dates back to the times of Ubin the Great. This dog ended it. He's gotta die.
Lugos The Mad|I pass judgment here, Leif. Remember that.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Wanna talk to Blueboy Lugos.
Skellige Guard 05|Hahaha… Hear that? He wants to talk to Lugos! What else, vagrant? Care to plough Freya?
Geralt|Works for me if you can arrange it.
Skellige Guard 05|I can arrange a knife 'tween your ribs as you sink to the bottom of the bay. Now bugger off.
Geralt|Don't make me hurt you. Got enough trouble as it is.
Skellige Guard 05|Think you scare me - scare Jorulf, son of Odmar, known elsewise as the Wolverine?
Lugos The Glaucous|Hey! What's all the hollerin'?
Skellige Guard 06|Some stranger wants on the longship. Says he's got business. But…
Lugos The Glaucous|Let 'im pass. If he turns a nuisance we'll toss 'im overboard.
Geralt|See you later, Jorulf, son of the Wolverine. Or whatever it was.
Skellige Guard 05|Never jest about my da. Never!
Geralt|Get outta my way.
Skellige Guard 05|Or what?
Geralt|Ugh, these conversations… Or I'll punch your teeth in.
Geralt|Lugos is expecting me. Lead the way.
Skellige Guard 05|R-r-right. Come on.
Skellige Guard 06|Why? I don't get it…
Geralt|Then stay here, think it over.
Geralt|Never mind… Good luck.
Geralt|Nothing. Just wondering what you're doing… unless it's a secret.
Skellige Guard 06|Secret? 'Tis a cause for pride! We sailed here under Blueboy Lugos to fight the monsters in the Cave of Dreams!
Geralt|Monsters, you say? You're in luck… Can I talk to Lugos? Maybe he cares to hire a professional.
Skellige Guard 05|Where you goin', vagrant? No stranger's gonna stroll about our boat!
Skellige Guard 05|Whaddaya want?
<|endoftext|>
Lugos The Glaucous|Know the last time I had a Continental on me ship?
Geralt|No.
Lugos The Glaucous|When I hauled prisoners from Velen to the slave market in Nazair.
Lugos The Glaucous|Now tell me why you're here.
Geralt|Your father felt you could use a witcher's help, and I owe him a favor, so…
Lugos The Glaucous|Told him not to meddle. Told him I'd manage fine on me own.
Geralt|Maybe that's not entirely true. Cave of Dreams - supposed to be a dangerous place.
Lugos The Glaucous|Mortally so. But that's my reason for goin' there.
Lugos The Glaucous|Fine, so be it, I'll take ye… Old man's like to throw a fit elsewise.
Lugos The Glaucous|I was about to go. You ready?
Geralt|We can go. Is it far?
Lugos The Glaucous|Nah, a stone's throw. Let's gather the lads and go in. We'll know soon if there's truth to the legends!
Geralt|What awaits us in the Cave of Dreams?
Lugos The Glaucous|Depends wholly on us, 'cause… Argh, I'll explain later.
Geralt|Gimme a minute.
Geralt|Any chance you got work for a witcher?
Lugos The Glaucous|Any chance you want to swim to Spikeroog? Hey, lads! Strip 'im bare, toss 'im overboard!
Geralt|Wait. Heard you're headed for the Cave of Dreams. Sure you can't use another sword or two?
Lugos The Glaucous|Give us a dozen griffins and a mass o' wyverns - me and the lads'll--
Geralt|You and your lads don't know a lick about monsters. Griffins and wyverns never share a habitat.
Lugos The Glaucous|Well. Maybe y'are worth a few silver… Fine, I'll take you with.
Geralt|Never mind. So long.
Lugos The Glaucous|Well? Can we go?
Lugos The Glaucous|So, will you finally say why you've come?
<|endoftext|>
Lugos The Glaucous|Geralt, these are the best warriors in me crew. They'll come with us. You know Jorulf, called the Wolverine…
Skellige Guard 05|G'day.
Lugos The Glaucous|… and this here's Uve Jabberjaw.
Geralt|Before we head off, will you tell me about this cave? You could at least tell me what we might have to fight.
Lugos The Glaucous|Only you can know that.
Skellige Guard 05|Elders say in the Cave of Dreams you face your greatest fears. Face what makes you wake up at night, screamin'. Somethin' that's already been, will be… or just might be.
Lugos The Glaucous|I do wonder what a monster slayer fears… But we've talked enough, lads. Swords in hand. Let's go!
Geralt|Why's Uve so quiet?
Lugos The Glaucous|Cause he got no tongue.
Geralt|What happened? He lick a frozen blade?
Skellige Guard 05|No. He tore it out 'cause he cursed King Bran while drunk. Lost his power to speak… but kept his honor.
Geralt|Interesting customs you got here.
<|endoftext|>
Lugos The Glaucous|The totem! Right where it should be. Now's when we eat the herbs.
Geralt|Why would we do that?
Skellige Guard 05|To go on - to where the nightmares are. So says the legend, and so we will do.
Geralt|Fine, give 'em here.
Lugos The Glaucous|Take it. Uve, Jorulf, eat up! To the last grain!
Geralt|What herbs are these?
Lugos The Glaucous|Hmm, what'd that druid say? Hemlock, poppy, nightshade, and that chicky-- no, uh, henbane.
Geralt|Whoa. In for one helluva ride.
Skellige Guard 05|I don't feel no different. How 'bout you, Uve?
Lugos The Glaucous|Hah! You're askin' a mute his opinion. You're feelin' it, mate!
Lugos The Glaucous|C'mon, let's go. Time to face our fears.
<|endoftext|>
Lugos The Glaucous|Get up, Geralt.
Lugos The Glaucous|You've paid your debt. You're a free man.
Geralt|Gonna tell your father what you faced in the Cave of Dreams?
Lugos The Glaucous|Course I will. I've no fear of 'im, right?
Lugos The Glaucous|Twas an honor to fight at your side. Farewell, Geralt.
Lugos The Glaucous|It's over, we leave soon. But first… your gold.
Geralt|Was I-- Was I out long?
Lugos The Glaucous|Aye. A while.
Lugos The Glaucous|Your gold. Take it and get outta my sight.
Geralt|What's this ab--?
Lugos The Glaucous|My father sent a messenger. You were bound by honor to help me. Yet you demanded payment.
Lugos The Glaucous|Take your gold, go, and keep away from our lands.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Villager 01|Long live Bran, Jarl of the Tuirseach, King of Skellige!
Skellige Villager 02|Long live the King!
Lugos The Glaucous|Bran? It's not possible…
Skellige Old Man 03|I see you're weary from the battle. Sit with me, son. Have some mead, pray tell of your adventures.
Skellige Guard 05|Thank you, my king. We--
Skellige Warrior 03|I shan't drink with you, old man, and I shan't call you king. Get off that throne while you've still strength in your decrepit bones.
Skellige Guard 05|Uve?! You can talk?!
Skellige Warrior 03|I… I didn't… But I…
Skellige Old Man 03|You insult me once more, Uve Jabberjaw. The first time I left you to punish yourself and retain your honor. But now… now you will die like a thrall, and eels will eat your remains.
Lugos The Glaucous|Uve? You all right, mate?
Lugos The Glaucous|Oh, yeah… Won't get a peep outta you. Let's go.
Skellige Old Man 03|C'mon, men! Whosoever brings me Uve Jabberjaw's head will get a longship to command!
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Guard 05|I… I know that longship…
Siren 01|Yessssss….. Yesss you do…. 'Tisss your father'sss boat.
Siren 02|The shhhhip you wrecked againssssst the rocksss.
Siren 01|Losssssst in our sssssweet sssssssong.
Skellige Guard 05|I'll kill you! Kill all you ploughin' sea whores!
Siren 02|Ssssslay us, try. But you'll not ressssstore hissss life.
Siren 02|You ssssslew him. A ssssson who killed hissss father.
Lugos The Glaucous|Jorulf… 'Twas an accident. The Althing cleared you of blame.
Skellige Guard 05|They couldn't clear my conscience. Let's go.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Guard 05|We…. We killed the King of the Wild Hunt!
Lugos The Glaucous|Nothin' to celebrate. Bugger always comes back.
Skellige Guard 05|See it? The razorback... clear up high?
Lugos The Glaucous|Eh, too big for a razorback. That's a blue.
Skellige Guard 05|A blue? With that short a snout? Herbs've robbed you of your senses!
Lugos The Glaucous|Hey, look! Flying fish!
Skellige Guard 05|What's strange about that? See them at sea every few crests…
Lugos The Glaucous|Aye, but those, they got wings! These here…? It's as if they're swimmin' through the air!
Lugos The Glaucous|Kill one monster, another crawls out… So is this yours, this a witcher's nightmare?
Geralt|Nope. This is daily life for us.
Skellige Guard 05|I see the way out! Follow me!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Quiet, calm… Suspicious.
Lugos The Glaucous|Must be my dream. I don't fear nothin'!
Lugos The Mad|You fear nothin', boy? You? You pissed your trousers when lightnin' struck the tree by our home!
Lugos The Glaucous|I was three years old. I've shown a hundred times since then that I--
Lugos The Mad|You pissed yourself. Before the whole village. The jarl's son. Argh, the shame. Shoulda banished you.
Lugos The Glaucous|You're a vision! A specter!
Lugos The Mad|A vision of your da… Who you fear. 'Cause you know you don't live up to 'im. You know you disappoint 'im.
Lugos The Glaucous|I'm a better warrior than he ever was.
Lugos The Mad|Prove it, ye little shite.
Lugos The Glaucous|Who's the better warrior now?! Who?! Ptooey!
Skellige Guard 05|Lugos, leave 'im. 'Tis only  a vision, true… but it's not proper.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|A portal… Shit.
Geralt|Can't stand that sensation.
Geralt|Aaargh! Not this way! The door!
Geralt|Must be the key.
Geralt|What a pigsty. Be hard to find anything here.
Geralt|Hm, what's going on here?
Geralt|Damn tower wants to gas me.
Geralt|Great, portal closed.
Geralt|Hmm… Looked smaller from the outside.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Fine. I'll look into the tower.
Skellige Fisherman 01|Hemdall guide you.
Skellige Fisherman 01|Once you're in, cast your eye around for the folk from our village - our druid and five good lads. Ah, it'd be a bitter shame to lose 'em.
Geralt|You have my word.
Geralt|You tried getting inside the tower?
Skellige Fisherman 01|Have we tried? Very same morn the tower appeared! We went right off, whole village or nearabouts!
Skellige Fisherman 01|Folk wanted to welcome its owner, if he come in peace, drive him off if he come with ill intent.
Skellige Fisherman 01|We knocked and banged, but no one answered. So we opened the door. An' that's when our knees turned to jelly.
Geralt|Why?
Skellige Fisherman 01|Cause beyond of that door was somethin' like… a sheet o' water, but standin' upright. Never seen such a thing in me life!
Skellige Fisherman 01|Druid said it were magic. Gathered five brave lads and they all marched in. No sign of 'em since.
Geralt|Remind me - what's the problem?
Skellige Fisherman 01|Ye blind? Storm's aragin', waves as big as huts, and to top it all, there's lightnin' crashin' all about!
Skellige Fisherman 01|And all this since that magic tower appeared. Somethin's gotta be done!
Geralt|Magic towers - not what I do.
Skellige Fisherman 01|Give it a think, please. We've none other to turn to.
Skellige Fisherman 01|Oh, you return. So - the tower? Anythin' to be done?
Geralt|So, what's the matter?
Skellige Fisherman 01|See that knoll beyond the village? Weren't a thing there for centuries, till one day we awoke, and bam! There were a tower atop it!
Skellige Fisherman 01|Then all a-sudden lightnin' started poundin' down, as if the Naglfar itself were sailin' in. Hasn't stopped to this day.
Skellige Fisherman 01|Somethin's gotta be done - about the storm! With waves like that we can't fish nor sail out to raid.
Skellige Fisherman 01|Do somethin' 'bout that tower… We're all countin' on ye…
<|endoftext|>
Mage 02|Find the tome?
Geralt|This it?
Mage 02|It is indeed! Now, back away a bit. I must deactivate the barrier.
Geralt|Right, time to get outta here and send this tower home. Where do I look for Gottfried's treatise? Any ideas?
Mage 02|Mhm. The library might be a logical place to start. The key should be in the laboratory.
Geralt|Where's that?
Mage 02|As you enter the room opposite, you'll see the laboratory to your left, the library straight ahead. But remember - you're an intruder. The tower is certain to want to stop you, make things difficult, at the least.
Geralt|We'll see who breaks first.
Geralt|You clearly know who I am… I don't even know your name.
Mage 02|Sigo Buntz, mage and sorcerer in residence at the court at Pont Vanis. This tower was to be me new home. Bought it at an auction, you see.
Geralt|A tower? At an auction?
Mage 02|It belonged to Gottfried Stammfeld, a mage of some renown. When he passed on, his heirs auctioned the edifice off.
Mage 02|They were all wary, repulsed. None dared see what Uncle Gottfried kept in his colored jars - if it was their contents that had stripped him of his sense of smell and taken his left eye.
Mage 02|They put the tower on the block along with all it contained. The price was unbeatable, I couldn't resist.
Geralt|What was that title again?
Mage 02|"Gottfried's Omni-opening Grimoire." It's a treatise.
Geralt|Gotcha. Be right back.
Geralt|Seen my share of wonders, but a tower that teleports itself - that's something new.
Mage 02|This Defensive Regulatory Magicon - I tried to access it. Must've erred, initiated some evacuation sequence.
Mage 02|…That opened the portal and jettisoned us through to Skellige. This, in turn, naturally generated electromagnetic disturbances--
Geralt|All very interesting, but I just wanna get outta here.
Mage 02|Then you must find "Gottfried's Omni-opening Grimoire."
Mage 02|That opened the portal and jettisoned us through to Skellige. This, in turn, naturally generated electromagnetic disturbances - hence the storm.
Geralt|Storm I promised to dispel.
Geralt|Some folk from the village came in here, right?
Mage 02|Their remains lie beside the golem.
Mage 02|They came in a few days past. I was surprised to see their garb, but it just never entered my mind we might be in Skellige.
Mage 02|They were just a few, led by a druid. The tower warned 'em, they failed to heed.
Geralt|Folk on An Skellig usually laugh in the face of warnings. If the tower'd asked nicely, then offered them a horn of mead - they might've left, then.
Geralt|The corpses over there… folk from the village nearby, right?
Geralt|Still looking. Be back soon.
Geralt|What?
Mage 02|A defensive system, magic. Ensuring only the tower's owner will use it. When it detects an intruder, it locks down all the rooms, denies access.
Geralt|And since neither of us is the tower's owner, the golem attacked me and you're stuck behind bars. How do we evade its other charming features?
Mage 02|We must deactivate the Defensive Regulatory Magicon. The tower's prior owner wrote a treatise about removing such defenses - "Gottfried's Omni-opening Grimoire."
Mage 02|There must be a copy in the tower. Find it, please. With it in hand, I can try to circumvent the security measures. Send you home, and take the tower back to Kovir.
Mage 02|Finally, someone's come to free me! And a famous witcher, at that! Thank the gods!
Mage 02|I'm damned lucky you happened to be in Kovir! Was it King Tancred who sent you, or the Society of Magic?
Geralt|Neither. And we're not in Kovir. We're in Skellige.
Mage 02|We're in… in Skellige? So… we've teleported? Oh, this is much worse than I thought…
Geralt|Not sure I follow…
Mage 02|Ugh. The tower is outfitted with a… a Defensive Regulatory Magicon.
Geralt|Lemme guess - you lost control of the golem. Imprisoned you here, then attacked me.
Mage 02|My, no, that's not it at all. The golems are but one of the tower's defenses. Part of its Defensive Regulatory Magicon.
Geralt|Local folk hired me. See, your tower's brought a massive storm to their island.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Fisherman 01|You're alive?! And in one piece?!
Geralt|One soaking wet piece.
Skellige Boy 02|Will you teach me to fly?
Geralt|Another time, maybe.
Skellige Fisherman 02|Never seen such marvels in me life! Boom! Flash! Tower disappeared, and you was fallin' from the sky. And the storm? Gone in an instant.
Skellige Fisherman 03|It's true! And that storm were keepin' us from huntin' and raidin'! You drove it off! A reward's in order, to my mind.
Geralt|Always knew An Skelligers were honest folk.
Skellige Fisherman 01|Aye, well if ye ever come through here again, stop in. Ye'll be welcomed with open arms.
Geralt|Thanks, farewell.
Skellige Fisherman 02|Wait, witcher! Did ye happen to see me brother in there? Hurn's his name. He went in with the druid and a few other lads.
Geralt|Didn't find any of your folk inside. Just a mage and some monsters.
Skellige Fisherman 02|Hmm. Perhaps the tower transported 'em somewheres? Was magic, after all… Maybe Hurn's still alive?
Skellige Fisherman 01|Let's go home, Njal, no point standin' here.
Skellige Fisherman 01|Farewell, witcher. Thanks again for helpin'.
Geralt|I found your friends. All dead, unfortunately. Sorry.
Skellige Fisherman 02|Told 'im not to go… but he wanted glory. Ahh.
Geralt|Thanks, but you need that coin a lot more than I do.
Skellige Woman 04|Not enough that he's handy, he's noble, too!
Skellige Fisherman 03|Ynga!
Skellige Woman 04|What?
Geralt|Found a mage in the tower. He was just as eager to take it away from here. Rewarded me generously for my help.
Skellige Fisherman 01|If that's so, we've naught left but to say our thanks.
Skellige Fisherman 01|Now didn't I tell ye… 'twere a witcher we needed? Aye, can't do better than an expert. And expert work deserves a fittin' reward.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What did you wanna talk about?
Triss|I got a strange message. I don't quite know what to think.
Geralt|Who was it from?
Triss|Ingrid Vegelbud's servant. Apparently Lady Vegelbud's prepared to donate a tidy sum. She wants to help mages escape from Novigrad.
Geralt|Guessing this wouldn't be a selfless act of charity.
Triss|You guess right - and that's my problem. Vegelbud needs a favor, from me… No details in the letter, unfortunately.
Triss|I'm supposed to meet the servant at the fish market. Says he needs to explain everything face to face, but these days I can't be sure meeting him's a good idea.
Geralt|Don't like this at all… But you seem determined - not about to let you deal with it alone.
Triss|Thank you.
Geralt|The servant - how're you supposed to contact him?
Triss|Said I'd recognize him - he'll be in a blue tunic, have a load of keys strapped to his belt. I'm supposed to ask him about the price for his trout.
Geralt|Gotta be kidding me… He tell you to come holding a red rose?
Triss|He doesn't mention flowers, but I won't refuse if you feel like giving me some.
Geralt|It's a fish market, Triss. Be able to get you some salted cod at best.
Geralt|Think it'll be better if I talk to the mystery man in the blue tunic.
Triss|He's expecting to meet me.
Geralt|You just wait nearby. I'll make sure that note didn't come from the witch hunters. Then you come in.
Triss|Mhm, fine. Let's meet there.
Geralt|Whose idea you think this was - the servant's or Vegelbud's?
Triss|My bet's on Ingrid. High-born damsels have a lot more time than their servants to read adventure novels.
Geralt|I don't think you should contact this man.
Triss|I'd like at least to check… My guess is this could be about a mage who needs help.
Geralt|Seems suspicious, and you just had a close scrape. Sure it's not time let one go?
Triss|And let the hunters grab the mages who remain here? Out of the question. If you don't want to help - tough.
Geralt|Triss, this is foolish. They catch you, and you won't be there to help anyone else. Promise me you won't go alone.
Triss|I'd hoped to go with you.
Triss|If you change your mind, come and see me.
Geralt|I'll think about it.
Geralt|Don't go near this, Triss. It's too risky.
Geralt|A Vegelbud was murdered recently - I know this. Their place must be crawling with guardsmen.
Triss|All the more reason to act quickly. If this is about a mage who's in danger…
Geralt|Sure it's not time you took a step back? Just had a very close scrape - need I remind you?
Triss|If you don't want to help - tough.
Geralt|What're you afraid of, exactly?
Triss|That it's a trap. On the one hand, it's an opportunity I can't afford to let slip - we need the coin. On the other…
Geralt|Nobody expects you to risk your life.
Triss|I expect that of myself. The thing is, it used to be easier.
Triss|When I didn't know what it's like to be tortured, what it's like to hear the screams of others and be unable to do anything…
Geralt|You could've escaped at any time.
Triss|I know! But I was still terrified! What if they fetter me in real dimeritium? You won't always be there to help.
Triss|When I didn't know what happens when the witch hunters get their hands on you…
Geralt|Who's this Ingrid Vegelbud?
Triss|The Vegelbuds are one of city's most influential families. Somewhat atypical - the women have been in charge for generations.
Triss|Patricia Vegelbud's the current materfamilias. Ingrid's her daughter.
Geralt|Know her personally?
Triss|No, seen her, that's all. And I've heard rumors. She's admired in Novigrad - for her business acumen.
Triss|And adored for the lavish balls she throws at the family estate outside town.
Geralt|Though the balls probably serve her business interests in some way.
Geralt|Given some thought to Ingrid Vegelbud's offer.
Triss|And? Will you help me?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What'd they want from you?
Novigrad Poor Man 03|I've no clue! First time I've laid eyes on 'em. Maybe… well, recently someone's been tryin' to question our messengers... 'bout the young count.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Hold on. Where's Miss Merigold?
Novigrad Poor Man 03|You were to come alone, miss!
Triss|If not for him, that trio would've dragged you in for questioning. The tall one was Valdo Muris, works for the witch hunters.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Aye, you're surely right, miss. I… it just weren't what I expected, since Lady Vegelbud…
Geralt|So what's this about? Be straight.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Lady Vegelbud's son - he's the... problem. Master Albert's taken an interest in alchemy… Temple Guard's gotten wind…
Triss|Wouldn't worry about the Guard, but since the mage hunters tried to grab you, I'd say Albert's in serious trouble.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Aye. Lady Vegelbud bought off the guardsmen, but since the hunters pay for every mage revealed to 'em…
Geralt|Guardsmen took a bribe from the frightened family, then whispered a word to the hunters anyway…
Geralt|Seems Albert needs to disappear - soon as possible.
Triss|I can arrange that. Think young Vegelbud can slip out of the house unnoticed?
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Tain't that simple, sadly. Master Albert's in hiding - at the Vegelbuds' country estate.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Lady Ingrid's got the notion she can get 'im out quietly - wants to throw a lavish masquerade ball.
Triss|Am I supposed to attend, help him escape?
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Aye, we'll not manage without you, miss. Lady Vegelbud fears the help's bein' watched.
Geralt|It's a good idea. A boisterous bash, that'll distract the hunters.
Triss|Especially if even half of what I've heard about the Vegelbuds' balls is true.
Triss|Word is at the last one they served a hundred different desserts, and the fireworks boomed from dusk till dawn.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|What with the war and all, m'lady's ordained but eighty-five desserts this time.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Won't be no candied petals of blue roses from Nazair. The roses've become dreadfully hard to come by.
Triss|Oh, I'd love to see it all…
Geralt|Hope we won't have to stay till the end.
Triss|You're coming with me?
Geralt|Course I am. Not about to send you into what could prove to be the lion's den by yourself.
Geralt|Think about it - eighty-five desserts. While you're still trying to keep your waist at twenty-two inches…
Triss|Geralt, please… How do we get to the residence?
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Your invitation - take it. Guard at the gate'll have instructions for you.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|You're to wear a fox mask, all right? Good luck to you.
Geralt|Think we can head there now?
Triss|You're kidding, right? We have to prepare, change clothes… most importantly, buy our masks.
Triss|I bet you can get everything we need for the ball at Elihal's shop. You know it?
Geralt|No. Where is it?
Triss|Nonhumans' shanty town. You should find it easily.
Geralt|Just masks, right? Probably don't need to wear a… doublet, do I?
Triss|A doublet, Geralt. And it's not up for discussion.
Triss|Take care of that, then come see me.
Geralt|Been there before. Elihal's a friend of Dandelion's.
Geralt|Something I need to do first.
Triss|Fine, buy our masks while you're at it. And you should change - ball attire.
Geralt|Expect any trouble during the ball?
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Hardest part'll be to keep Master Albert's departure a secret from his grandmother.
Triss|Is that necessary?
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Lady Patricia's a fervent believer of the Eternal Fire. Knows naught about Albert's interests in alchemy.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Luckily the elder Lady Vegelbud's a rare visitor to the country residence.
Geralt|Truly an atypical family…
Novigrad Poor Man 03|I'm not one to judge, sir.
Geralt|Has Ingrid recovered from her mother's death?
Novigrad Poor Man 03|How d'you know 'bout that…?
Geralt|Took an interest in the matter.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Well… Lady Ingrid don't allow herself to demonstrate any weakness. At least not in front of the help.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Master Albert's safety - it's what matters to her now.
Geralt|If the hunters are after Albert, I doubt some merrymaking will distract them.
Triss|Geralt, a ball at the Vegelbuds' is hardly some merrymaking…
Geralt|How'd Ingrid Vegelbud know to contact Triss? That Triss was the right person?
Novigrad Poor Man 03|We learned Miss Merigold had helped Myra Baiss disappear once the witch hunters were onto her.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Myra provided Lady Ingrid with magical assistance on a few occasions, with m'lady's… ahem… afflictions.
Triss|Makes sense. Myra mentioned treating a high-born lady to me once.
Geralt|Now that we're past the initial courtesies, maybe you can tell us who you are.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Lady Vegelbud's valet. I… I meant you no offense, sir.
Triss|Why wouldn't Lady Vegelbud meet with me personally?
Novigrad Poor Man 03|She was afraid they'd follow her. Been a nervous wreck of late.
<|endoftext|>
Triss|You get everything?
Triss|Just a shame you didn't dress up like I asked.
Geralt|Really expected me to show up in a lacework collar, ruffles on my trousers?
Triss|You'd even look great wearing a bustle.
Geralt|Doubt I wanna know what that is. For now, you'll just have to survive on bread and witcher.
Triss|Well then - shall we go?
Triss|A shame events like this are so rare. Without them I'd never get to see you dressed up.
Geralt|Argh. Damn doublet's chafing my armpits. And it feels like they sewed wires into this.
Triss|I'll be sure to admire your valiant suffering the whole time.
Triss|Come back once you've got it all.
Geralt|Learn anything else about Albert?
Triss|Well, almost none of the mages have heard of him. An amateur, I guess.
Geralt|So why the interest - temple guards first, then hunters?
Triss|He's easy prey. And that's exactly why we should help him.
Triss|I got a message - the Vegelbuds have postponed the ball. A family emergency, apparently.
Geralt|Yeah, heard something about that.
Triss|Were you able to get everything we need?
Triss|We still have to wait for Ingrid Vegelbud's message.
Geralt|We still need it?
Triss|Ingrid wrote that she's counting on me. The ball's not canceled, it's just postponed.
Triss|Geralt!
Geralt|Someone's in a good mood.
Triss|So?
Geralt|Nothing. Just, you look good when you're giddy.
Triss|Ingrid's servant brought a message - the ball's back on.
Triss|Oh my, certainly took my request to heart.
Geralt|Mean you weren't being serious? Still got time to change…
Triss|Don't you dare. You look great.
Triss|My, don't you look splendid. Sadly, I've got bad news.
Geralt|Better not be joking. What - doublet doesn't match my boots, or vice versa?
Triss|It's not that.
Geralt|Everything's ready, we can go.
Geralt|Got a fox mask for you.
Triss|Thanks. Think anyone'll recognize me?
Geralt|Well, I'd recognize you with a sack on your head.
Triss|You don't count.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|We're Lady Ingrid Vegelbud's guests.
Novigrad Guard 02|Your invitation, please.
Novigrad Guard 02|All's in order. You'll find Lady Vegelbud in the estate's yard. Look for the parrot mask.
Novigrad Guard 02|One more thing - leave your swords here, please.
Geralt|Must be some mistake. You know why we're here, don’t you?
Novigrad Guard 02|Of course. But I've orders to make certain every guest enters the estate unarmed.
Geralt|Dammit…
Novigrad Guard 02|A pleasant evening to you both.
Geralt|Fine.
Novigrad Guard 02|Greetings, m'lord, m'lady.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|And do you know what she's wearing?
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|No, what?
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Stitch for stitch the same dress my cousin's wife wore a year ago.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|It's identical! Just longer, of another color and it has no lace.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Does no one truly know who she is?
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|She behaves like a princess of the blood, but in my view…
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|Well, you can see for yourself. At the ball's end all shall remove their masks.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Phwar! See the one in the tight tunic? The one who arrived with the red-headed bitch?
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|Well, well. You called Vegelbud an old stick-in-the-mud, yet here she's hired a male stripper!
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|But why did he come with a woman?
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|Perhaps she hands him his props.
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|Can you imagine? He failed to recognize her in that mask!
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|His own wife? Seems rather unlikely…
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|Teehehe! Well, he was quite drunk at the time.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Hello, Vivian! No use pretending you don't know me!
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Is that any way to treat an old mate? Refuse to acknowledge him?
Triss|There's been a mistake. I don't know you, sir.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Don't be foolish, Vivian… I'd recognize that mane anywhere.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|You might play the great dame now, but before that Baron Edward… something… pulled you from the gutter, you were a common--
Geralt|Enough. The lady said she doesn't know you.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Who's this? The new one? Older than the last, it seems. A decrepit moss-covered prick. So, the less they can, the more they pay, is that it?
Geralt|You asked for it…
Geralt|Let's go, Triss. Wouldn't wanna make a scene.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Vivian! Hey! Ah, I liked you much better when you worked the carriages outside the Passiflora.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Come back, you coward! I'm not done with you!
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Mercy… I've had enough.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Ah, another challenger! Please, join us! Sir Devanon just vacated his place at the table. It's rather unlikely he'll be back!
Geralt|What happened to him?
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Some good men took him aside to prevent him from hurting himself.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|So? Shall we play?
Novigrad Rich Man 03|First you shall face Margrave Vladimir de Cret.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|The man can afford to lose, so he's likely to be reckless.
Geralt|Let's do it.
Geralt|Not in the mood.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Hahahah. Not in the mood to win?
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Your next opponent - Count Gomo Seeling.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|In his day, his father lost the family estate in the Nimnar Valley. Seems Gomo has followed in his footsteps.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Yet do not underestimate him. Desperate men can be dangerous.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Sir Marius Florin.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|They say he never loses thanks to his zeugl-bone amulet. Naturally, I could tell you more on the subject, but…
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Bravo! The lovely lady clearly brings you luck, sir - hold her, keep her, never let her go!
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Well, now you must win it back!
Novigrad Rich Man 03|So - one more round? When the cards come your way, you must spring on the opportunity!
<|endoftext|>
Triss|Moritz? What're you doing here?
Novigrad Nobleman 02|Little Miss Merigold, well, well. And I was led to believe this would be an elegant affair.
Triss|Yes, I missed you, too.
Triss|But can we put that aside for now? Do you have a way out of Novigrad? You can join us if you want..
Geralt|Triss! Not what we're here for.
Triss|No, it's exactly why we're here.
Triss|Well, Moritz?
Novigrad Nobleman 02|Join you? And just who would I join?
Triss|Your friends, among others. Once we've all gathered, I'll lead you--
Novigrad Nobleman 02|You will lead? Forgive me, Merigold, but that is like allowing myself to be led by a lame duck.
Novigrad Nobleman 02|Farewell.
Geralt|Who was that?
Triss|He's an old friend. His name's Moritz Diefenthel. Tell you the story later.
Geralt|Didn't like that guy. Why'd you insist on talking to him?
Novigrad Nobleman 02|I wish you a cold farewell.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Old Man 03|The men of this family have little luck. Skaron Vegelbud died young…
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Do you think the women, they… ?
Novigrad Old Man 03|I can't be certain, but rumors abound…
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Apparently they have this contraption at the Passiflora.
Novigrad Old Man 03|Tis an offence to nature! Does the Temple Guard know what goes on there?
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Shh! The Guard is well aware.
Novigrad Old Man 03|Hmm… And you say the price is reasonable?
Novigrad Old Man 03|Times of famine and war are necessary. They are how society purges itself, regenerates.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Indeed. Naturally, this only applies to the lower orders. And nonhumans.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|The Vegelbuds alone maintain a certain standard in regard to elegant receptions.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Huh. Very true. Others claim it's inappropriate in a time of war…
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|Ahh, the things people won't say to excuse their own stinginess.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Don't listen to those demagogues. Radovid stands for stability.
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|He's a wonderful man, clearly… But something about his eyes…
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Yes? What about them?
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|Duke Mormontre - do you remember? The one who held his daughters captive in his cellar?
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|He had eyes like that…
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|You still speak to her? After that horrible mismarriage?
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Her father and I were chums, you see. I knew old Grimstone quite well.
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|What of it? He's dead, isn't he?
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|I know this might sound immodest, but our hunting hounds are simply the best.
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|They do seem fierce…
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Yes, but they're superbly trained. Won't even whimper without my permission.
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Sit!
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Stay!
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Lie down.
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Scratch!
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Hmpf, nothing extraordinary about it…
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|Lovely pups, indeed.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Thank you for agreeing to help. My valet warned me you might come with a… friend.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|I'd prefer as few as possible knew of Albert's flight, but if you trust this man…
Triss|Like no one else.
Geralt|Let's get Albert. Where is he?
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Entertaining the guests. He has always been an outsized presence at my receptions. I preferred not to arouse any suspicions…
Triss|When can we take him away?
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|We shall have to wait until the guests have imbibed enough to notice only the goblet-laden trays. Don't fret, it won't be long.
Geralt|How will we recognize him?
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|He's donned a panther mask. He knew you were due to come for him. Seemed rather excited, ironically.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|I'm afraid he's not fully comprehended the danger he faces. As I said, he's not terribly bright.
Geralt|Don't worry about that. He'll fit right in with a good number of the other mages.
Triss|Geralt!
Triss|Let's go find him.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|I shall await word from you.
Geralt|Is your son ready to go? We'll have to act quickly.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Yes, I've seen to everything. Where will you take him?
Triss|You're better off not knowing any details. He'll be safe, I promise.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|But…
Triss|Please trust me. It's not the first time I've done this.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|I know. Thank you.
Geralt|Any sign of the hunters recently?
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Since they attacked my servant at the market - none. All has been quiet.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|But I bribed a man of the Temple Guard. He claims there's more and more talk of Albert in the ranks.
Triss|How did the guardsmen learn about your son's interests to begin with?
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Ahh, unfortunately, I cannot be sure Albert himself was not the source, merely boasting about an experiment. He's careless that way.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Like his father - a kind man, but a dimwit. Devoured by an arachas, I don't know if you've heard.
Geralt|Yyyeah… Must've traveled far and wide.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Hardly. He attempted to breed them. Perhaps I should be pleased Albert adopted alchemy as his hobby - a safe one, relatively speaking, until recently, that is.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Excuse me a moment.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Miss…?
Triss|Yes, it's me. The trout buyer.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Hm? Oh, yes, of course. Please excuse the precautions, but… perhaps we can speak somewhere in private?
Geralt|I think we've met before.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Oh, you're…! Indeed. Well, I feel reassured Albert will be in good hands.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|I must have a cup of chamomile…
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Oh, so you are…
Triss|Yes. When can we leave the estate?
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Weeeelll… Mama said it would be best to wait until everyone's drunk. Besides, there'll be fireworks later - a jolly good distraction.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Once they've begun, I shall slip away, saunter into the garden. We will meet in the hedge maze.
Geralt|Be waiting for you there.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Very well, but first you absolutely must try the Fiorano rosé. Absolutely!
Geralt|Albert Vegelbud?
Novigrad Rich Man 01|No, heheheh…
Novigrad Rich Woman 01|Heeheehee.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|I'm a black panther. Rrraw!
Novigrad Rich Woman 01|Oh my, Count!
Geralt|Your mom sent us, Mr. Panther.
Geralt|Your excursion to Novigrad - we should talk about it.
Geralt|Nice mask.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Rrraaw!
Novigrad Rich Woman 01|Heeheehee!
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Yes?
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Old Woman 01|Seeing her in that mask… Have I told you of what I was reminded?
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Mhm. I believe you have.
Novigrad Old Woman 01|Staring into the distance again? Who is it this time?
Novigrad Old Woman 01|Then I said, "Perhaps you should not remove your mask." And she said…
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Mhm, mhm.
Novigrad Old Woman 01|Are you listening to me, Ingrid?
Luiza La Valette|Geralt of Rivia is in attendance. I saw him.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Who? Gerard? Is that the count with the bad teeth?
Luiza La Valette|No count, a lowly witcher. And his teeth are in good order.
Luiza La Valette|In fact, I'd been meaning to ask you…
<|endoftext|>
Dijkstra|A second chance! Ahahah! Good one! Cemeteries're full of men who thought Old Joel'd give them a second chance!
Geralt|Sigi, I'll be.
Dijkstra|Geralt! Damn it all, how'd you recognize me?
Geralt|Your voice - unmistakable.
Dijkstra|Oh yes, those famous witcher senses - finally getting some use out of them.
Dijkstra|And who's this creature with you? May I be introduced?
Triss|Hey, Reuven.
Dijkstra|It can't be! Is that the lovely warble of my favorite accomplice?
Dijkstra|Well, we've jested and laughed, but I've a sense you're in a hurry.
Geralt|Really?
Dijkstra|You know, Geralt, somehow I dislike running into you at parties.
Dijkstra|My bones start to ache, as if bad weather were approaching.
Geralt|The mask - dead giveaway.
Dijkstra|Hahaha. Perfect, right? Could take it off and no one would know the difference. Hahaha,
Triss|Hey, Reuven.
Dijkstra|Look at that - my favorite accomplice. What's this, taking a day off from saving the world?
Dijkstra|Later, Geralt.
<|endoftext|>
Luiza La Valette|Is it you? I cannot believe this. How dare you show yourself here? I shall speak to Ingrid and…
Geralt|She's the one invited me.
Luiza La Valette|Clearly she's not heard enough about you.
Triss|The Baroness la Valette?
Geralt|Unfortunately.
Luiza La Valette|Is that you, Geralt of Rivia? And Triss… I did not see you on the guest list.
Geralt|Baroness. We're here as… friends of the family.
Luiza La Valette|As am I, yet my name was there, at the very top of the list.
Triss|Not at all surprising, my Lady.
Luiza La Valette|These courtesies grow tiresome quickly. Why are you here?
Geralt|I think you should ask Lady Vegelbud.
Luiza La Valette|I shall, believe you me.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Someone's coming.
Triss|Is it Albert?
Geralt|No, just some lost guest. Shh!
Triss|Heeheehee. Must be looking for his beloved.
Triss|Like in that elven tale about the frog and the lark. "Inchu, inchu, beag broggha…" "Inch by inch, little frog…" Heeheehee.
Geralt|Sshhhh! Let's go.
Triss|Hahahha.
Triss|I sure hope the other guests don't get drunk as quickly as I did!
Geralt|Sooner we get out of here, the better.
Triss|Oh, no! I plan to have a good look at this famous maze of theirs first…
Triss|I hear the statues there are completely… entirely…
Geralt|Entirely what?
Triss|Nude!
Triss|Relieved to get that mask off. If only for a little.
Triss|Great view from here. And there's even wine.
Triss|It's been so long since I've been to a feast, ball or reception. Amazingly pleasant change from the sewers of Novigrad.
Geralt|So, does this mean it's a good time to ask you about…
Triss|Yes?
Geralt|About that mage we met earlier.
Triss|Ah, Moritz. What do you want to know?
Geralt|Got the impression he doesn't exactly like you.
Triss|I just think he'd love to have me as his charge, rather than his leader.
Geralt|See, but you're the one organizing the mages' escape from Novigrad.
Triss|Sometimes I have no idea how I actually managed to bring them all together…
Geralt|You're a charismatic leader. Simple as that.
Triss|You really think so?
Geralt|Absolutely. Next thing you know they'll be calling you Iron Merigold. Could even wear an eye patch and it'd look right.
Triss|Hahah. For a moment there I thought you were being sincere.
Geralt|Course I'm being sincere. Look at me - didn't blush a bit.
Triss|Hahahah.
Geralt|Personal charm - that's what it's about.
Triss|Hahaha. Careful - that sounded like a compliment.
Geralt|Glad it did.
Triss|Oh. Are you trying to…?
Geralt|Didn't mean it to. Don't quite know why I always say stuff like that around you.
Triss|Always? Guess I remember things a little differently…
Geralt|They don't have anyone else.
Triss|Sheesh. Thanks, Geralt. If you meant to say something nice, try again.
Geralt|I'm glad we came here, together.
Triss|Really? Despite all these bloated nobles, the bowing, the fake smiles?
Geralt|Mhm. Not often we get the chance to just talk.
Triss|Something you've been meaning to say to me?
Geralt|Your eyes, they're like stars.
Triss|Hmmmm… Geraaalt…
Geralt|Really, they're incredibly shiny. Could be the wine. You better not drink anymore.
Triss|You're terrible, you know that?
Geralt|Uh, you look nice.
Triss|Pfff, a witcher's compliments…
Geralt|How'd you meet?
Triss|Geralt, all mages know each other. Some are well over a century old - that's plenty of time to make acquaintances.
Geralt|In that case: when did you meet him?
Triss|At a feast, long ago. He walked up and… just blatantly offered to teleport us somewhere … quieter.
Geralt|You turn him down?
Triss|Is that what you think?
Triss|He actually pursued me for a while afterwards.
Geralt|Seems like just the type.
Triss|Really. At the time, to me he seemed… sweet.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Miss Merigold! At last! So sorry we are forced to meet under such incredibly inopportune circumstances…
Geralt|You can say that again.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|… but I'm sure we'll make up for it another time. I absolutely must show you my alchemical formulae…
Triss|Anyone follow you?
Novigrad Rich Man 01|I don't believe so.
Triss|Just in case, you two switch masks.
Triss|We'll go first. Geralt will follow right after.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Saddled horses await in the stables.
Geralt|Good. Meet you there.
Triss|Hahaha! Waaaoho! Hahaha…
Geralt|Careful…!
<|endoftext|>
Triss|Come on, Geralt!
Geralt|Triss, wait!
Triss|Chase me!
Triss|Well? Hahaha. Come on!
Triss|Care to sit down for a spell?
Triss|What's that smell? Jasmine?
Triss|Ah! The garden. Let's go!
Triss|Let's look for Albert.
Geralt|Hope Albert hasn't forgotten the reason for this whole get-together.
Triss|Wanna wait in the garden? I saw a nice spot there earlier.
Triss|Oh! Let's look around.
<|endoftext|>
Triss|I'm sorry, I acted irresponsibly. It was the wine, too strong.
Geralt|No need to apologize. It was… nothing.
Triss|Yes, nothing.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Miss Merigold…
Triss|We need to go.
Geralt|I know. Be careful.
Triss|We shouldn't have… It was my fault, I know. The wine… went straight to my head. I'm sorry.
Geralt|Triss… Don't apologize.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|I had begun to worry.
Geralt|Everything's fine. Though you should probably send someone to… clean up the garden - before any guests wander in there.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|I'm to send servants to the garden?
Geralt|Yes.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|I shall see to it. And you must hurry.
Geralt|Everything set?
Triss|Yes. Got your swords back from the guard. And Ingrid gave me the coin. It's, uh… more than I expected. Stunningly more, frankly.
Geralt|Excellent. So where're we gonna get away to?
Triss|You? Nowhere.
Triss|What happened at the fountain…
Triss|It's finally possible, probable, even - that we can get all the mages out of Novigrad.
Triss|You know where to find me if you want to say goodbye.
Geralt|Goodbye?
Geralt|Glad I could help you collect it. You'll find good use for it?
Geralt|Ran into some trouble.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Hunters? Will they come here?
Geralt|No. We've got some time. But please send someone to the garden. Needs a little tidying.
<|endoftext|>
Voorhis|Gregor, have you seen Derghoff? Just moments ago…
Voorhis|Oh, apologies. I mistook you for my friend, sir. He wears a similar mask.
Geralt|General Voorhis?
Voorhis|Geralt of Rivia! So I was not entirely mistaken.
Geralt|Hm, pleasure, as always. This is…
Voorhis|A beautiful and mysterious lady. Let us leave the formalities to the event's end, when all will remove their masks.
Voorhis|More fun that way, wouldn't you agree?
Triss|I would, sir.
Voorhis|And now I must beg your pardon - I really must find Derghoff, and quickly. A lovely evening to you both!
Geralt|No worries.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Having trouble?
Witch Hunter 02|Nothing fucking but! One ploughing trouble after the other!
Witch Hunter 01|But what's it to you? Who are you?
Geralt|Geralt of Rivia. Witcher.
Geralt|Radovid sent me.
Witch Hunter 01|Ah, it's you… Been waiting for you.
Geralt|Don't exactly sound delighted.
Witch Hunter 01|Would you expect us to? We've done half the work, now you show up to take all the glory?
Geralt|Word was you hadn't been able to get inside.
Witch Hunter 01|Till yesterday. When we found this.
Witch Hunter 01|Doesn't look like much, but it's got power of some sort. Opens the entrance.
Geralt|Good work. Saved me some time.
Witch Hunter 01|We're thrilled.
Geralt|Think Philippa's still inside?
Witch Hunter 01|That we don't know. Only certain thing is she was there at some point.
Geralt|Certain? How's that?
Witch Hunter 01|We've been after her since Loc Muinne. Pokin' out her eyes weren't enough. Radovid should've gutted her there and then.
Witch Hunter 01|As it is, she turned into an owl and fled. Flew across Kaedwen and Redania, then tucked herself away here.
Geralt|What can I expect to find inside?
Witch Hunter 01|Everything. Anything. It's an old elven temple. The witch Eilhart turned into her hideout.
Witch Hunter 01|Look at them. Fell into some magic trap, then monsters attacked 'em. Barely got out alive.
Geralt|Any of your men still down there?
Witch Hunter 01|Dozen or so went in, they's all that came out. Rest're probably dead.
Geralt|Time I saw if Philippa's still in there…
Witch Hunter 01|Don't count on anyone goin' in to retrieve your corpse.
Geralt|Great. I'll take that now if you don't mind.
Witch Hunter 01|Here. Choke on it, you twit.
Geralt|A means to solve your troubles.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Perfect hideout - for an owl…
Geralt|Be a bit harder for me to move around.
Geralt|Portals, great. And the witch hunters probably messed with them.
Geralt|Works. Who woulda thunk.
Geralt|Hate portals. Make my stomach turn.
Geralt|Damn - inactive.
Geralt|Maybe I can start it up…
Geralt|Did it. Activated the portal.
Geralt|Oh yeah, gotta have a sentry, of course…
Geralt|Crystal from a megascope… heavily chipped.
Geralt|Wonder if it still works.
Geralt|Triss'll know what to do with this.
Geralt|Yen'll know what to do with this.
Geralt|Guess I gotta go to Skellige.
Geralt|Gotta go back to Kaer Morhen.
Geralt|Must've been her laboratory.
Geralt|Gotta be the lowest level.
Geralt|Missing one tile.
Geralt|Chest completely crushed. Ribs must've pierced the lungs.
Geralt|Ooo, flesh charred to the bone in places.
Geralt|Hmm, a power cell for portals… Feels dead.
Geralt|Maybe a Sign'll revive it…?
Geralt|Should work now…
Geralt|Right, now to activate it…
Geralt|Power cell. Got it.
Geralt|Another inactive portal.
Geralt|Missing its power cell… maybe the nekkers took a liking to it.
Geralt|Harpy feather, a rectrix.
Geralt|Gotta be some mechanism that opens this door.
Geralt|Hm, a tunnel… Wonder where it leads.
Geralt|Mhm. Nekkers - might've expected as much. The love places like this.
<|endoftext|>
Witch Hunter 04|Stay back! Not one step closer!
Geralt|Sheathe that before you hurt yourself.
Witch Hunter 04|Wait… You… You that witcher the king was supposed to send?
Geralt|Guessed it. Think you know by now how dangerous this place is. Oughta wait up above with the others.
Witch Hunter 04|Not a chance! Those cowards ran at the first whiff of monsters. I'm made of stiffer stuff.
Witch Hunter 04|Besides, something big's set to happen here, I just know it… I learn what it is, Radovid'll appreciate it… King'll promote me, maybe even give me a medal.
Geralt|All right, let's get you out of here.
Witch Hunter 04|Told you already - no chance.
Witch Hunter 04|Besides… The teleport's power cell - I broke it off. We've to wait till they come for us, got no choice.
Geralt|Nobody's gonna come for us. Gimme the crystal, I'll get us out of here.
Witch Hunter 04|But the monsters…
Geralt|I'll defend you.
Witch Hunter 04|What if you can't?
Geralt|Be a good little hunter and gimme the crystal.
Witch Hunter 04|I am a good little hunter. There you go.
Geralt|No time to argue. Gimme the crystal.
Witch Hunter 04|Over my dead body!
Geralt|Have it your way…
Geralt|What's the big event that's supposed to happen?
Witch Hunter 04|Uhhh… Don't know the details, but I came across Philippa Eilhart's notes.
Witch Hunter 04|Mentioned Ida Emean, Margarita Laux-Antille, Francesca Findabair and Fringilla Vigo. As I see it, they aim to meet… here!
Geralt|Think Philippa's still here?
Witch Hunter 04|Can't rightly know. Sure, we searched a few caverns, but hidden nooks abound. If someone wanted to hide in here, they could, easily. Even if they weren't an owl.
Witch Hunter 04|Poxy mutant!
Witch Hunter 04|That all you got?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Bed, table, a few chairs… Modest, but a home nonetheless.
Geralt|Blood-stained surgical instruments… Philippa operated on someone here.
Geralt|Notes… Charred, almost completely.
Geralt|Can't read a thing.
Geralt|Agates. Kind Philippa always wore around her neck.
Geralt|Except… why're these covered in blood?
Geralt|She either fought someone… or used them in her experiments.
Geralt|A megascope… scorched, covered in soot…
Geralt|Maybe one of the crystals survived.
Geralt|Hmm, what's this?
Geralt|Aniseed and birch bark… Powerful disinfectant.
Geralt|Agates covered in cloth.
Geralt|Maybe… a failed experiment? Then Philippa threw these across the cave?
Geralt|That'd be like her.
Geralt|A remex… its edge frayed.
Geralt|This is an owl feather.
Geralt|Another feather. Doubt Philippa had an aviary - these are signs of polymorphy.
Geralt|Love letters?
Geralt|Hm, interesting… Philippa dumped some woman - for Dijkstra.
<|endoftext|>
Witch Hunter 01|You're alive…?
Witch Hunter 01|Find anything?
Geralt|Cremated notes, a nekker nest, rats… Nothing interesting.
Witch Hunter 01|Why don't I believe you?
Geralt|Dunno. Your problem, I guess.
Witch Hunter 01|Oh, you're wrong there…
Witch Hunter 01|Grab him!
Geralt|Tellin' you the truth. Awfully prone to suspicion, you hunters…
Witch Hunter 01|Not without reason…
Geralt|Dust, dirt… and a megascope crystal.
Witch Hunter 01|Whatever the hell that is… But… good chance it's important. Hand it here. We'll see the king gets it.
Geralt|Forgetting yourself. Save your orders for your men.
Witch Hunter 01|As you wish…
Geralt|So be it… But to the king directly. Straight into his hands.
Witch Hunter 01|You can be sure o' that…
Witch Hunter 01|Let's go!
Geralt|Not your concern.
Witch Hunter 01|Wrong there, friend. I serve the king. Everything that concerns him's my concern as well.
Witch Hunter 01|Hand it over, whatever you found. We'll see the king gets it.
Witch Hunter 04|And then he opened the portal and pranced through.
Witch Hunter 01|You shoulda gone after him!
Witch Hunter 04|Straight into some monster's jaws? Preferred to come up, inform you. Besides, he'll come back this way, he's gotta.
Witch Hunter 04|Oh, there he is now.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Spoke with Radovid… Offered me a contract - to find Philippa.
Triss|The bastard… wasn't enough that he poked her eyes out? Probably wants to torture her some more.
Triss|You turned him down, of course.
Geralt|No.
Triss|Geralt, you know what he did to her…
Geralt|Relax. See, I figured if I agreed, I could look for her without his men getting in my way. Fact is, I'm curious to know what happened to her.
Triss|So? Learn anything?
Geralt|Even better. Found this.
Triss|A megascope crystal. Hm, it's damaged… but it could still work.
Geralt|A bit. Seems she hid in some elven ruins outside Novigrad after she fled Loc Muinne.
Geralt|Conducted some experiments there. This might tell us more.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Got summoned by Radovid. He wants me to find Philippa.
Yennefer|What a king. Not only cruel, but naive as well. Did he truly believe you would help him?
Geralt|I took the job.
Yennefer|Why?
Geralt|Promised a generous reward.
Yennefer|Oh, so the legendary monster hunter turns master head hunter, is that it?
Geralt|Largely depends on what's in this.
Yennefer|A megascope crystal? Damn, it's cracked… but it could still work.
Geralt|Gotta say I'm curious what happened to her... And I didn't want any Redanians getting in my way while I tried to find out.
Geralt|Look. Found this in Philippa's hideout.
<|endoftext|>
Margarita Laux Antille|…Francesca's equally hesitant. Neither she nor Ida wishes to decide blindly.
Philippa Eilhart|They'll stop hesitating as soon as we convince Keira and Fringilla.
Margarita Laux Antille|Fringilla's on our side. She'll join us as soon as she's finished some business in Nilfgaard.
Philippa Eilhart|Wonderful, that leaves Keira. The problem is, I've still no notion where she could be.
Margarita Laux Antille|What about Yennefer and Triss?
Philippa Eilhart|Yennefer's never belonged to the Lodge, and Triss… Well, we shall see. I must regain my vision. I can go to Novigrad then to see Arthur de Vleester. The word is Triss is also carousing about the city.
Margarita Laux Antille|You still insist? Phil, pardon my saying so, but you will never regenerate your eyes on your own.
Philippa Eilhart|Vilgefortz did it. I'm employing the same method - cultivating tissue on precious stones.
Margarita Laux Antille|It's madness… …need… ...ower… ...ut your…. …reat dange…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Probably better if you keep it.
Triss|Much better. It'll be safe with me.
Triss|I'll try to cast a diagnostic spell, maybe learn something more.
Geralt|Good luck.
Geralt|Don't see why not. I was supposed to bring him Philippa, true, but he might be happy with this.
Triss|I sincerely hope you're not serious. Radovid hates mages, Philippa especially!
Triss|If she falls into his hands, she won't get out alive this time.
Geralt|You're right, this could put the Redanians back on her trail…
Geralt|It's not like they said anything specific.
Triss|Radovid is holding mages captive. He'll force them to extract more from the crystal.
Geralt|You're overreacting. Besides, Philippa's not one to make the same mistake twice.
Triss|Geralt, think this through…
Geralt|I will. Thanks for your help.
Geralt|Hmm, guessing Radovid would love to get his hands on this…
Triss|You're not going to give it to him, are you?
Triss|That's it. That's all I could recover.
Geralt|I get that right? Philippa say she wants to restore her vision?
Triss|Seems she was planning to grow tissue on precious stones.
Geralt|Makes sense. Found agates covered in blood in her hideout.
Triss|If she pulled it off, she'd only be the second person in the world to do so.
Triss|But the bit about the Lodge - that's what I found interesting.
Geralt|Meaning what, exactly?
Triss|The names they mentioned - all the most powerful sorceresses. Former members of the Lodge. They clearly mean to revive it.
Geralt|That good or bad?
Triss|Depends for who.
Triss|Philippa's always said that "if magic perishes, so shall this world." And the Lodge was to protect the mages and their interests.
Triss|Radovid and the emperor, on the other hand, would not be pleased. Both would have to respect our opinions, and neither likes to share power.
Geralt|"Our" opinions? You'd join them really?
Triss|No, I've got other plans.
Triss|So, what will you do with the crystal?
Geralt|Haven't decided… Bet Radovid would be very interested in it…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Right. It'll be safer with you.
Geralt|I accepted a job, plan to finish it as best I can. Crystal needs to go to Radovid.
Yennefer|Very, very bad idea. You could harm not only Philippa, but Triss, me…
Geralt|Yen, I've decided. I'll give the crystal to Radovid.
Yennefer|You're making an error. But it is your decision.
Yennefer|Dammit! That's it - I can't recover any more.
Geralt|Hm… Wonder what I should do with the crystal…
Yennefer|It cannot fall into Radovid's hands, not under any circumstances. You'd better leave it with me.
Geralt|I hear right? They mention the Lodge?
Yennefer|Yes, and later Philippa said something about vision regeneration…
Geralt|Think Philippa pulled it off? Restored her eyesight?
Yennefer|It would be reckless, but not impossible. They seemed to say she was planning to implant tissue grown on precious stones.
Yennefer|Till now only Vilgefortz has ever managed. If she succeeded… well, I suppose congratulations would be in order.
Geralt|Margarita mentioned Ida and Francesca, then Keira and Fringilla…
Yennefer|I've little doubt Philippa means to revive the Lodge of Sorceresses.
Geralt|They weren't sure about Triss, excluded you right away…
Yennefer|I'd never agree to rejoin. Philippa believes only the Lodge can look after mages' interests effectively. I disagree and prefer to act alone.
Yennefer|Besides, the moment's inopportune. Reviving the Lodge would enrage both Radovid and the emperor. They're at a critical stage of their duel for influence, and neither would welcome a new player.
<|endoftext|>
Radovid|Witcher. Any progress? Have you found Eilhart?
Geralt|No, wasn't in her hideout. But I found this crystal there.
Radovid|If I'd wanted a shiny bauble I would have gone to a jeweler. You were to bring me Eilhart.
Geralt|This is a megascope crystal. The mages you keep imprisoned should be able to extract something from it.
Radovid|Yes… At last, they might prove useful.
Radovid|Not exactly what I expected, but… Very well, you've earned your pay.
Radovid|Now forgive me - I've affairs to which I must attend.
Geralt|She definitely hid where your men said, but I arrived too late. Fortunately or not - can't really say.
Geralt|There'd been a fire in the hideout. Philippa died in the flames, most likely.
Radovid|A fitting end for a witch.
Radovid|So. Have you any proof?
Geralt|Got this crystal.
Geralt|No. But you have my word.
Radovid|Hahah, your word? You give me your word?
Radovid|Sorry, but Eilhart herself taught me to doubt everyone, especially their word. So we've naught to talk about. Farewell.
Geralt|Crystal from her megascope. I gave it to your men.
Radovid|How curious. They claimed to have found it themselves. And to have saved your life when you became trapped.
Geralt|They lied. They'd lost over a dozen men by the time I arrived. I gave the crystal to their commander - thought he'd get it to you quicker.
Radovid|Your word against theirs. And you've no proof.
Radovid|You disappoint me, witcher. Apparently, I thought too highly of you.
Radovid|Get out of my sight.
Geralt|Yeah, should've expected as much… What else did they claim? They mention the golden dragon they slew so heroically?
Radovid|Envy speaks through you, nothing more.
Geralt|Wasn't where your men said, but I did find signs of someone doing medical experiments there.
Radovid|Oh, that's something.
Geralt|Think Philippa tried to restore her eyesight.
Radovid|Verily? Empty eye sockets suit her so much better.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What was that about?
Dandelion|She spat in my face, or might as well have. Called me a "whoremonger and a witless hack." Can you imagine? Wit is my forte!
Geralt|Gotta say, Priscilla's really growing on me…
Dandelion|Save it.
Geralt|And why don't you save your pouting? Prove to her she's wrong.
Dandelion|Exactly what I plan to do. I've always dreamed of having my own cabaret. A bit of paint and plaster and this place will do splendidly.
Dandelion|Just one hitch - I need coin. So… if you happen to get a break between drowners and ekimmu-jigs, maybe you could help an old friend out?
Geralt|How can I help you?
Dandelion|I dated this girl once - Sophronia. That's a name, if you can believe it. Has a merchant for a father, importer of spices from Zerrikania. And daddy dear would never refuse his daughter dear a thing.
Dandelion|We can borrow the coin from her.
Geralt|Fine, tell me what you want. Got a feeling you've a plan all cooked up.
Dandelion|Sophronia could still be holding a grudge after our unfortunate… parting. But, with a touch of help from you, I know she'll forgive me. And then give me that loan.
Geralt|What's this help entail?
Dandelion|First of all, we need to borrow a dull sword from Madame Irina - one of her props. You know, the kind they use during performances?
Dandelion|Get that, then meet me outside Sophronia's house.
Geralt|Fine, but…
Dandelion|Geralt, the only "buts" in this plan'll be the ones filling my seats! It'll work, you'll see!
Dandelion|Get the sword from Madame Irina and meet me outside Sophronia's at sunset!
Geralt|Let's say I agree and go see Madame Irina. What'll you be doing in the meantime?
Dandelion|Something I have to finish. But I promise I'll do it before you come back with the sword. Then I'll tell you the rest.
Geralt|Sorry, Dandelion. Maybe later.
Dandelion|You always say that! If you change your mind, I'll be here.
Geralt|Name rings a bell… Isn't this the woman you abandoned without saying a word? Stepped out for a bottle of wine, never to return?
Dandelion|Knew I bought that wine for a reason…
Geralt|A long time ago, that.
Dandelion|Been away a while, sure. Which is why I need… to draw on your authority. You've got some, you know, no matter what you might think.
Geralt|How much d'you need? Maybe I can lend you the coin.
Dandelion|Thank you, Geralt, but I refuse to take a single crown from you. You know what they say - "Fastest way to lose a friend's to loan him some coin."
Dandelion|But a favor - that's different.
Geralt|What kind of favor?
Geralt|Maybe the Vivaldis would give you a loan. I'd vouch for you.
Dandelion|Funny you mention that. I went to see Vivaldi. Know what he said? Witchers are no good as guarantors - risk of premature death is way too high.
Dandelion|But… I have another idea.
Geralt|Where'd you get this cabaret idea?
Dandelion|It's been a dream for years. Ever since we went to see one in Oxenfurt. Remember? The dancer hanging from the chandelier? And once she was completely downside up, she called you over and--
Geralt|I remember.
Dandelion|How could you forget?! And this place'll be even better, I promise.
Dandelion|That is, of course, if I can scrounge together the funds for some remodeling.
Geralt|Ugh. What's he schemed up this time?
Geralt|What did you want from Sophronia? Slipped my mind…
Dandelion|Geralt, I want to transform this esteemed establishment into a first-class cabaret. And that takes funds. Enter Sophronia.
Geralt|I remember now. Gotta help you convince her you're trustworthy.
Dandelion|Exactly. And to do that we need a sword from Madame Irina Renarde's prop collection. So, will you help?
Dandelion|Without that sword from Madame Irina my plan's as doomed as devil piss. Will you get it for me?
<|endoftext|>
Dandelion|Ah! Finally made it!
Dandelion|Listen, here's the plan. Sophronia loves adventure-filled romance novels. I can be a hero in her eyes - if I can just save her from a bandit.
Dandelion|I'll have her eating out of my hand. And there's no way she'll begrudge me that loan.
Geralt|Want me to be the bandit?
Dandelion|Knew you'd see the sense in it right away.
Geralt|Are you serious? That's your brilliant plan?
Dandelion|I never called it brilliant, but any kind of plan is better than none.
Dandelion|Written your lines already.
Geralt|You've written what?
Dandelion|So you know what to say during the performance. Here.
Dandelion|And your mask. Put it on, Sophronia can't recognize you.
Geralt|But…
Dandelion|No time! Sophronia's coming! Stick to the plan. We'll meet at the Rosemary in the morning!
Geralt|Hm, this could actually work.
Geralt|Dandelion, this is not gonna work.
Dandelion|It will, it will. You'll see.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Tremble… Flaxen-haired wench?! Umm… Bow before the prince of thieves!
Dandelion|Not so fast!
Dandelion|Drop your sword, scoundrel! This is your first and last warning.
Novigrad Rich Woman 01|Dandelion?!
Dandelion|Tis I. Though the scum of this city call me the Crimson Avenger!
Geralt|No! Not the… Crimson Avenger!
Dandelion|Silence, vermin! You shall regret the day you were born!
Geralt|More like the Crimson Asshole.
Geralt|Not your lucky day, miss. Hand me your purse, now.
Geralt|Stop right there!
Novigrad Rich Woman 01|Wha… What is this? Help! Save me!
Geralt|Fine, let's get this over with.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|You're both stage artists, and cabaret's a form of theater. Interior should reflect that.
Dwarf Man 01|A wonderful choice it is! At last!
Dwarf Man 01|Gentlemen, you're done lollygaggin'! Get to work!
Geralt|Well, well, guess this cabaret's the real thing.
Priscilla|Ever since Dandelion inherited this place he's talked about it constantly. I just never expected him to… take action. And so quickly.
Geralt|Who knows, might even settle down now. He'll have to keep an eye on the business. Who would've known…
Priscilla|Despite what people say about him, Dandelion approaches life very rationally.
Geralt|We talking about the same Dandelion? Man who loses a fortune worth half of Novigrad in one night?
Priscilla|Dandelion can also be responsible. He always pays anyone who works for him on time… And he's never missed a performance.
Geralt|Sure hope your opening won't be the first. He's still not here.
Priscilla|Well, he said as soon as he'd got the coin, he'd go see Polly, our choreographer. She's missed the last few rehearsals.
Priscilla|I certainly hope he's not gotten into trouble.
Geralt|Anything's possible with Dandelion. Lemme see if I can't find him.
Geralt|True enough. Adheres to the principle that a life enjoyed is a life well lived.
Priscilla|You needn't mock.
Geralt|I'm not. I mean that. Nothing wrong with the principle - Dandelion just knows how to enjoy life. It's a good thing.
Geralt|Boudoir seems like a better fit for cabaret. Just don't go overboard on stuffed upholstery.
Geralt|Sure, I've known him longer, but he's never so much as changed his socks for me. Never mind commissioning a full-blown renovation.
Geralt|He's doing this for you, clearly. You should decide.
Dwarf Man 01|Don't ye worry, sir, it'll be a belter!
Dwarf Man 01|If Master Dandelion's goin' to such lengths for his lass, we sure can't let 'im down!
Priscilla|There's been a misunderstanding! You're here too early!
Dwarf Man 01|We agreed to meet today, so we've come today. Supplies're all hauled in, and me crew's rarin' to work.
Dwarf Man 01|We'll start just as soon as our lovely directress gets 'round to decidin' on the decoration.
Priscilla|But Dandelion doesn't even have the coin to pay you!
Geralt|Turns out he does now. Or soon will. At any rate, he's working on it.
Dwarf Man 01|See? It's all peachy. So, will ye finally decide what style ye want for this interior?
Geralt|Hmm… What're our choices?
Dwarf Man 01|Master Dandelion said he was torn between boudoir style and theater décor. Promised to let us know his choice soon as we arrived.
Dwarf Man 01|Now we're here, but no decision's been made. And the lady's horribly surprised she's to choose, though apparently this whole renovation's for her sake.
Priscilla|For me?
Dwarf Man 01|Well it's not for me. Now would ye please decide 'fore I burst a vessel?!
Priscilla|I've no idea what Dandelion would like. Geralt, you've known him longer. Say something.
Geralt|Why're you asking me?
Dwarf Man 01|Well, the lovely lady seems to be havin' a hard time decidin'. And Master Dandelion said he was torn between boudoir style and theater décor, but that he'd let us know just as soon as we arrived.
Dwarf Man 34|What're ye doin'? Knockin'-off time already?
Dwarf Man 42|Nay, just hopped out for a smoke.
Dwarf Man 34|They still arguin'?
Dwarf Man 42|Seems they can't decide on a color now.
Dwarf Man 34|Don't know what the fuckin' problem is.
Dwarf Man 34|A color's either pretty or ugly. Ain't no philosophy to it.
Priscilla|I associate boudoirs with a feminine elegance that also has an edge - claws, you might say. That fits a cabaret perfectly.
Priscilla|Hmm… Both our lives have revolved around the stage, and cabaret is a form of theater, in a way… Fine, let's do the theater décor. I certainly hope it will be to his liking.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Citizen Woman 01|You know I'm a dancer!
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|I thought you was just talkin'…
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Got dancers 'round every other corner in the big city.
Novigrad Citizen Woman 01|You pig!
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Over my dead body! You'll not swivel your arse in some brothel!
Novigrad Citizen Woman 01|It's not a brothel!
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|No? This placard sure claims otherwise!
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|I know full well what sort o' debauchery goes on in them dumps!
Novigrad Citizen Woman 01|Reaaally? I wonder how.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Thought you'd give up this nonsense once I put a ring on your finger!
Novigrad Citizen Woman 01|And I thought you'd stop drinking with your mates.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|You get what you see!
Novigrad Citizen Woman 01|Took the words right out of my mouth!
<|endoftext|>
Dandelion|Polly! Everything all right? Open up!
Geralt|What's the ruckus about?
Dandelion|Polly and her half-brained fiancé - they're fighting. She's the only one in this town who knows anything about choreography… and that lummox won't let her work for me.
Dandelion|Ho-ho-hold on - what're you doing here? We were gonna meet at the Rosemary.
Geralt|We were, but you didn't show. Priscilla started to worry, so I came to see how you were doing.
Dandelion|Priscilla started worrying about me? That's so nice…
Geralt|Less for her than for you, I'm sure, so let's get back.
Dandelion|Did you not hear what's going on in there? We've gotta help Polly. Why do beautiful women always end up with such dicks?
Geralt|No idea. Stand back, I'll break the door down.
Dandelion|Wait! Do we have to destroy her house? She keeps a spare key around here somewhere.
Geralt|Fine, let's find the key.
Geralt|How would you know she keeps a spare key around here?
Dandelion|It's not as if we started working together yesterday. Before Polly joined forces with Hubio--
Geralt|You'd visit her… often?
Dandelion|I'd hide out here while Priscilla and Polly rehearsed at the Rosemary and Thyme. They worked on the dance numbers, I composed.
Geralt|So, Polly's not one of your--
Dandelion|I never mix business and pleasure.
Geralt|The one exception being Priscilla.
Dandelion|Who you were just saying is worried about us, so enough of the chatter and start looking.
Geralt|Ah, the key.
Geralt|Not here.
Dandelion|Dammit, now where would she leave…?
Dandelion|Find anything?
<|endoftext|>
Dandelion|Sorry dear, Geralt can get carried away at times and…
Novigrad Citizen Woman 01|You know, maybe it's for the best. I felt no pity, no remorse as I watched you brawl. Can't help but think it means I've no actual feelings for Hubio…
Dandelion|You're not mad?
Novigrad Citizen Woman 01|No. Grateful. I believe I needed a shock not unlike that one to understand that what I had with Hubio… well, it wasn't working.
Novigrad Citizen Woman 01|I'm ready to try something new… I'd gladly start by choreographing your revue.
Dandelion|Excellent! Then I'll see you at the Rosemary and Thyme!
Geralt|Hm, kind of expected her to get hysterical, fly into a rage.
Dandelion|So did I. Merely goes to show just how much we have yet to learn about women…
Geralt|One of whom's waiting for you at the Rosemary.
Dandelion|I've still gotta stop by Rautlec's. Commissioned some new placards from him a while ago, but Hubio came across the old version. Ploughing artist's got some serious explaining to do!
Geralt|I'll go see Rautlec, you head back to the Rosemary. Or Priscilla will have my head.
Dandelion|Really? You'd go?
Geralt|No, said that for the hell of it. Tell me where he lives.
Dandelion|Port-side.
Geralt|See you soon.
Geralt|Who's Rautlec?
Dandelion|Never heard of him? Hank Rautlec, famous portrait artist?
Geralt|Commissioned a portrait artist to paint your placards?
Dandelion|Henri's an old friend, needed the coin.
Dandelion|And I decided we needed new placards to promote the opening performance. Seats won't fill themselves, you know.
Geralt|Hm, guess not all women go for arrogant pricks after all.
Dandelion|One swallow does not a summer make.
Geralt|So, time to head back?
Geralt|We should get back to the Rosemary. Priscilla's probably worried.
Dandelion|Ugh. Told you to let me do the talking.
Geralt|If I hadn't intervened, you'd be in my shoes right now.
Dandelion|I beg to differ. Many a man's started out wanting to kill me, and ended up buying me a round.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Whoa! What the devil's this? Get outta my 'ouse!
Geralt|Watch it. And leave the woman alone.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|What the-?! She's my betrothed!
Novigrad Citizen Woman 01|But I'm not your property!
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|I love her. I'll not let her sway her arse in 'is brothel!
Dandelion|Whoa, slow down there a minute. This is clearly one gigantic misunderstanding. One I can clear up in the blink of an eye.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Shove your excuses up your arse! Sod off, or I'll split your skull!
Geralt|My friend asked you nicely, so please be courteous in return and hear him out. Or we'll settle this another way.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|All right.Talk.
Dandelion|Hubio, right? Polly's told me so much about you. She said you're erudite, and have an open mind.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|You said that?
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Well, there's a truth to it. My mind's the open sort… But its open-sortedness ends when my betrothed starts waggin' her arse around brothels!
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Get out of here, both of yous! Polly's not goin' anywhere!
Geralt|Let him finish. There's no brothel involved.
Dandelion|You see, friend, Geralt just hit the nail on the head. For what you have there is the old publicity placard.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Old?
Dandelion|Very. From a time when my establishment was under different management.
Dandelion|I, however, would never let any indecency take place in my cabaret. My very reputation precludes it.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|So, what's all this about?
Dandelion|You're betrothed is a first-class artiste, and I want to offer her a position worthy of her talents. She's to be my choreographer. And that, in turn, means she'll receive a share of the proceeds from every performance she… choreographs.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|You mean to say… coin?
Dandelion|And fame. No flirting required. You have my word.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Hmm… 'spose, in that case…
Novigrad Citizen Woman 01|I knew you'd agree!
Dandelion|It's settled, then! See you at the Rosemary, Polly.
Geralt|Asked nicely, but you just wouldn't listen. And I'm not the kind to give second chances.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Stay outta this, freak, 'fore this ends with you gettin' your head smashed in.
Dandelion|Gentlemen, please…
Geralt|There it is - one word too many.
Novigrad Citizen Woman 01|Well, I'm off!
Dandelion|I'll catch up to you.
Dandelion|Phew, never expected that to go so well.
Geralt|You handled it well, Dandelion. Man was putty in your hands once you called him erudite.
Dandelion|In negotiation, as in combat, the key is to find your opponent's weak spot and exploit it to the hilt.
Geralt|Could've skipped all that talking if you'd left it to me.
Dandelion|What, so you could smack him? Stopped to think how Polly'd react to that? Think she'd be thrilled? What if he smacked you back and won?
Geralt|He wouldn't've won.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Rich Man 18|Well, Rautlec, seems you're a considerable sum in the red… But you shan't back out on that account, eh?
Halfling Man 02|Won't have much of a choice before long.
Novigrad Rich Man 18|Come now, old sport, we can't allow that! Who'd I wager with then, eh? Listen, here's what we'll do: we'll make one more bet. If you win, I'll pay your debts and we'll continue playing. What do you say?
Halfling Man 02|And if I lose?
Novigrad Rich Man 18|One worry at a time, old chum! Well, I'm off to place my bet.
Geralt|You Rautlec?
Halfling Man 02|Henri Rautlec, artist, painter, debtor and martyr to my art. At your service.
Geralt|Dandelion sent me.
Halfling Man 02|Oh yes. Tell him his placards are done and safely hidden away. Yet alas, I cannot fetch them as a group of angry creditors has seized my home.
Halfling Man 02|And now Count de Luverten has offered me the chance to win it all back… I'm to wager on a race.
Geralt|What's there to worry about? This is your chance to settle up, get a clean slate.
Halfling Man 02|I've had a spell of bad luck lately. Should I agree to de Luverten's offer and lose, I shall be in bondage to him for all time.
Geralt|Let's do this: I'll enter the race, you'll bet on me, win, pay your debts, then give me the placards.
Halfling Man 02|You're that good a rider?
Geralt|Far from the worst. Go tell the count you accept his offer.
Halfling Man 02|Thank you. I-I never expected this… May I ask to what I owe this generosity?
Geralt|Let's just say I like to do a good deed from time to time. Can we get those placards now?
Halfling Man 02|I'll bring them to the Rosemary and Thyme. Just as soon as I settle my obligations.
Geralt|Fine. See you there.
Geralt|Well, guess Dandelion'll have to live without his placards.
Halfling Man 02|I truly regret it worked out this way. Please, convey my apologies to Master Dandelion.
Geralt|Listen, all I really want're the placards. Tell me where you tucked 'em away, and I'll be outta your hair.
Halfling Man 02|Forgive me, I cannot. I hid them with family heirlooms that would work those barbarians lurking outside my home into a slavering froth.
Geralt|Then go fetch 'em yourself. I'll wait here.
Halfling Man 02|If I show my face there without coin, they'll beat me to a pulp. I must win back my debt somehow, else I'll never return home.
Geralt|Generous. Not just anybody could afford to do that.
Halfling Man 02|De Luverten is not just anybody. He's Duke Salm's youngest son. Salm of the well-known family of gem dealers.
Halfling Man 02|One debt more or less makes little difference to him.
Geralt|Think I might've run into one of them…
Halfling Man 02|Then you know my predicament.
Geralt|Lemme pay off your debt. No strings attached.
Halfling Man 02|I'm as good as dead. Time to flee to safer climes. Kovir, perhaps?
Geralt|Good idea. Lot of people heading that way these days.
Halfling Man 02|Halflings among them?
Geralt|Not many, but word is everyone's welcome, regardless of species.
Halfling Man 02|Hmm, then Kovir it is. Perhaps my luck will improve there…
Halfling Man 02|Farewell, friend, and convey to Master Dandelion my kindest regards… and my deepest regrets.
Geralt|Come on. There's gotta something we can do.
Halfling Man 02|Alas, I'm afraid all is lost. I had my chance and I squandered it.
Halfling Man 02|I fear Kovir is my last resort.
<|endoftext|>
Dandelion|No… No, not all. But I'd imagined something more… you know, more theatrical.
Dandelion|What about Rautlec? Did you get the placards?
Geralt|That's complicated, see. Much more than you assumed. Rautlec's in trouble… Afraid you'll have to do without the placards.
Dandelion|Take it I'm better off not knowing. Ugh, this is disastrous. Well, hope the Chameleon's popularity won't suffer as a result.
Geralt|Guess everything's ready. So when's the opening?
Priscilla|Soon. We start our dress rehearsal in an hour. I just need to nip back home for my dress.
Dandelion|Thanks for everything.
Geralt|Don't mention it.
Dandelion|Seems my cabaret dreams are about to come true. So, a round to celebrate? I'm buying.
Geralt|Why not.
Dandelion|That's my boy.
Dandelion|The foreman mentioned he saw you and Priscilla talking…
Geralt|He saw right.
Dandelion|Aaaaand… she say anything about me?
Geralt|Mhm. She said you've gained some weight, and that you should bathe more often.
Dandelion|Very funny, Geralt. Shove it.
Geralt|Well, well, never thought I'd live to see the day. Dandelion living in monogamy…
Dandelion|I've always been monogamous. Well, near enough. I just changed muses often.
Geralt|Priscilla another one for your collection?
Dandelion|No. She's its crowning glory.
Geralt|One thing's eating me. How'd you manage to get the loan from Sophronia?
Dandelion|Ugh. Wasn't easy. She got so excited about our performance, I had to read to her for four hours. Four hours from "The Cloak and the Dagger."
Geralt|You mean you didn't…?
Dandelion|Are you crazy? Who do you think I am?
Geralt|She said something that made me think she's not entirely normal.
Dandelion|What?
Geralt|That you're responsible, got your feet planted firmly on the ground.
Dandelion|You're pulling my leg.
Geralt|Not this time.
Geralt|Hmm… Can't say I remember. Why do you ask?
Dandelion|No reason.
Geralt|Thanks, but I'm not really in the mood.
Dandelion|Have it your way. I, on the other hand, will drink.
Geralt|Never mentioned wanting to change the name.
Dandelion|Rosemary and Thyme wasn't all bad, but it conjured images of Temerian cuisine served by waitresses in peasant garb.
Dandelion|Chameleon's a lot better for a cabaret, apart from which it emphasizes that the place has undergone a transformation. Just… a better ring to it all around.
Geralt|What about choreography? Prepared anything special for the opening?
Dandelion|We haven't, but Polly has! She's priceless! Came in and brought the girls in line before I could say "knickers!"
Dandelion|Premiere'll have the audience on their feet - on their knees - both at the same time!
Dandelion|We have, but can't really say how it'll turn out without Polly here… The girls claim they know what they're doing, but it all looks a little like an orchestra without a conductor.
Priscilla|Don't worry, they'll be fine. And if anything goes wrong, we can wave them off the stage, start our concert early.
Geralt|Rautlec said he'd bring them on his own. Should be here soon.
Dandelion|Great! The best way I can think of to promote the Chameleon!
Priscilla|Don't you like it? But I thought a boudoir would be right in line with your tastes…
Dandelion|Oh, you chose it! Well, I'm not saying it's bad, just different, not exactly what I'd envisaged…
Dandelion|You know, now that I think about it, you're absolutely right! A boudoir's the perfect setting for a cabaret!
Geralt|Well, well… see the crew's been hard at work. Not bad.
Dandelion|I love it. Especially the, uh… accoutrements on the wall.
Geralt|Priscilla picked them.
Dandelion|Well, I must admit, you have great taste!
Geralt|Time's up. Got a few other matters to tend to.
Dandelion|Sure. See you at the opening.
Dandelion|Unless we have to call it off. Where is Priscilla?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Sorry, something came up. Be there this time, I promise.
Hattori|Very well. Do you recall where? The crane at the docks. After dark.
Geralt|All right.
Geralt|Fine. Arrange the meeting.
Hattori|Splendid. Meet me after dark, near the crane at the docks.
Geralt|Want me to help you get your supplies? How?
Hattori|Just come with me to a meeting. As my bodyguard, it'll bolster my confidence. Truth be told, not so long ago I tried negotiating some iron deliveries with one of the King of Beggars' men.
Geralt|Take it he's important in the underworld, too?
Hattori|Yes. What's more he's on piss poor terms with Cleaver, who backs van Hoorn.
Hattori|It's just… he demanded an inordinately large share of the profits. I thought you might help me negotiate. I don't mean gratis. I'm certain we can agree on a fee.
Geralt|Could I… choose something from your collection?
Hattori|Forget this rubbish! I shall forge you a sword fit for killing gods.
Geralt|I dunno. Criminal underworld - not really sure I wanna meddle with them.
Hattori|I badly need your help. Van Hoorn is a van whoreson. He must be taught a lesson. I'd be eternally grateful. Plate armor? Yours! Or perhaps you'd like a catapult or a trebuchet?
Geralt|Right, King wouldn't worry about an embargo Cleaver imposed.
Geralt|Sorry. Negotiations? Just not in my line of work.
Hattori|Should you change your mind, you know where to find me.
Geralt|Greetings, Hattori. I'm back.
Hattori|Greetings, witcher. Have you considered my offer?
Geralt|Quite a collection. Premium quality, too.
Hattori|Thank you. I've kept these as mementos.
Geralt|Damn shame you don't make them anymore. I'd gladly replace what I have with this kind of steel. Someone with your skills - why the hell are you kneading dough?
Hattori|This might surprise you - the pay is better. But above all, it's much safer. Food vendors rarely disappear or end up as cripples.
Geralt|I see. Someone controlling Novigrad's smithing market?
Hattori|Not officially, though… All supplies go through Ernst van Hoorn. And they say he plays cards with Cleaver… frequently.
Geralt|Tried negotiating, making a deal?
Hattori|With van Hoorn? Do you jest? He's a proper heartless bastard. Either play by his rules and pay him, or go out of business.
Geralt|Hm. I see.
Hattori|But I shan't complain. Dumplings have proven an excellent source of income. It's just… well…
Geralt|You miss the heat of the forge… Tried getting supplies from someone else?
Hattori|Those rogues of the underworld control all the sources. How am I to talk to them? Unless… would you be willing to help me?
Geralt|Ernst van Hoorn - who's that?
Hattori|Modest beginnings… a small dockside workshop. However, he proved extremely ambitious. He knew he could not compete with other sword makers on skill alone, so he resorted to other methods.
Geralt|Other methods?
Hattori|A bit of slander here, buying business debt cheaply and taking over there. And whenever the competition was a "ploughing non-human," he'd accuse them of being havekars.
Geralt|Is that how he did you in?
Hattori|I did not give up without a fight. I went to town hall, negotiated. Alas, it was all in vain. He'd already enlisted Cleaver's protection, and in Novigrad few dare get in Cleaver's way.
Geralt|Greetings, Hattori.
Hattori|Greetings, witcher. Why didn't you show? You made a fool of me.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|You were to come alone, elf. Who's this?
Geralt|A concerned friend.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Oh. Fine. Here's how we see things. The boss at loggerheads with Cleaver? There's gotta be a pay-off. We've got an offer and it's non-negotiable.
Geralt|Surprise us.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|A steady supply of iron in exchange for fifty percent of your profits.
Geralt|Give you twenty-five.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Who are you to dictate anythin' to the King of Beggars? Thirty-five's as low as we'll go.
Geralt|Fine. We'll take your offer.
Hattori|But perhaps we should--
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|You should go home, elf.
Geralt|Agreed.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Pleasure doin' business with you.
Dwarf Man 02|Oh, Tinboy. Too much drink - it's softened your bloody mind. This 'ere's Cleaver's territory, ye prick-whittler!
Geralt|Twenty-five's our limit. We'll throw in a discount at the shop.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|You're clearly daft, tramp. No deal. Come on, boys.
Geralt|Fine, no deal.
Hattori|Geralt, what are you--?
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Wait. All right. Certainly know how to negotiate, "concerned friend." Ugh, twenty-five it is… and the discount.
Geralt|You're kidding, right? We'll give you ten.
Hattori|Geralt, what are you--?
Geralt|Be quiet.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|You're fuckin' with fire, git. I don't have to haggle with you. Final offer - forty.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Right. Sure hope there's a pay-off at the end of this.
Geralt|So, supplies? That something we can count on?
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Who do you take me for? Gave you me word, didn't I? But I'd hire guards if I was you. You never know with Cleaver.
Geralt|Think they'll come back?
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|A few of Cleaver's little shits escaped. Bugger probably already knows everythin'. I've no men to spare, can't guarantee your safety. If I was you I'd lie low for a time.
Geralt|Thanks, Tinboy.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Down the line, the bosses'll make a deal… you'll be left alone. All you gotta do is stay alive till then, hahaa…
Geralt|What now?
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Here we chat, while your partner's just flown the coop.
Geralt|Dammit. Hey! Wait!
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Hahahaa! Good luck!
Geralt|Can you provide protection?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Hattori? You in there? Open up!
Hattori|No chance. Leave me be.
Geralt|Don't be silly, let me in.
Hattori|No, never. I shall stay in here until Midinváerne.
Hattori|Forgive me, Geralt - that was a mistake. To parley with bandits, make deals…
Geralt|Too late now. King of Beggars'll get you supplies and then what? You'll have to pay him.
Hattori|What have I done...? Geralt, you must help me.
Geralt|No, I won't. I'm a witcher, not a bodyguard.
Hattori|Precisely! You must find me a bodyguard! Geralt, I beg you! They'll kill me!
Geralt|What? Where am I supposed to find you a bodyguard?
Hattori|There's a mercenary, Sukrus, often drinks at the Sturgeon. He's an old pirate, a Skelliger. He used to work for me. Huge as an oak, wouldn't fear a dozen Cleavers.
Geralt|Can't you talk to him yourself?
Hattori|We parted… not on the best of terms. That is to say, he demanded a bonus and I--
Geralt|Didn't pay him. Great. What now? Am I supposed to pay your dues?
Hattori|I'm certain you'll find some way to agree. Geralt, please don't leave me this way.
Geralt|Got anyone specific in mind?
Geralt|I was supposed to find you protection.
Hattori|And have you?
Geralt|No, not yet.
Hattori|Geralt, by all the gods, I compel you! Help me!
Geralt|Uh, remind me what you wanted me to do?
Hattori|I beg you! I cannot stand it here much longer! Find me protection! A Skellige pirate! Have you done that?
Geralt|I'll be back.
Hattori|Don't leave me here!
Geralt|Hattori. Still building barricades?
Hattori|Still.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Greetings. I'm Mr. Sukrus' collector. Come to get--
Novigrad Trader 02|Mr. Sukrus? The man's a boor! I do not deal with illiterate peasants! Tell him I'll pay - just as soon as palm trees sprout on Skellige.
Geralt|Palm trees have sprouted on Skellige. Now pay up.
Novigrad Trader 02|It can't be! Of course I shall pay Sukrus! A letter of credit acceptable? Redeemable at the Vivaldis' bank? Yes? I'm on my way!
Geralt|Got a problem with Sukrus?
Novigrad Trader 02|I thought - mead! I shall import mead! Daft idea for a business! The import duties - my bollocks shrivel at the thought! I paid the bastard what we agreed less half the duties. And palm trees will sooner sprout in Skellige--
Geralt|Yeah, I know.
Geralt|I don't have time for this. So long.
Novigrad Trader 02|Thief! Thief! At him!
Novigrad Trader 02|He's gone mad! Run!
Novigrad Trader 02|The Tuirseach clan, we're kings among the clans…
Geralt|Greetings. Here to collect…
Novigrad Trader 02|Coin for Sukrus! Oh yes, I know. But I'll not pay the bastard another copper. Palm trees will sooner sprout in Skellige!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Greetings.
Sukrus|Aye aye, Geralt, how you doin'?
Geralt|Looking for a bodyguard. Interested?
Sukrus|Why not. If there's coin in it.
Geralt|Well, there isn't, not yet.
Sukrus|So we're to barter? Favor for a favor, aye?
Geralt|I'm gonna kill you, Hattori… Yeah, I guess. What did you have in mind?
Sukrus|Me brother-in-law owes me some coin. Get it back, and we’ll talk.
Geralt|Hhhh, dammit. I'll do it. Where'll I find him?
Sukrus|Nearby, at the docks. Ye know what? I don't care for his coin, all in all. If ye don't get it back, I won't mind.
Geralt|So what do you want me to do?
Sukrus|Smash his stock of mead. Was me brought it in from An Skellig.
Geralt|That a mature thing to do?
Sukrus|Nay, but it's fair.
Geralt|You're joking, right? No, thanks.
Sukrus|Ye change your mind, ye know where to find me.
Geralt|What did you want me to do?
Sukrus|If I'm to work for ye, you gotta tend to the merchant in the port.
Geralt|Tend to him?
Sukrus|Get me coin back or smash up his stock of mead.
Geralt|Ahhh, not thrilled, but so be it.
Geralt|Got rid of that shipment.
Sukrus|Is that so? Well done, mate! So who am I to knock off?
Geralt|Just want you to keep an eye on someone. This swordsmith - seems you know each other…
Sukrus|Éibhear Hattori, the elf? Tried swindlin' me on axes once, the bastard. You workin' for him?
Geralt|You could say that. We're trying to dismantle the swordsmithing monopoly in Novigrad.
Sukrus|Oooh, a noble cause! Well, you're vouchin' for him, don't see why not. I'll grab some of the boys and we can go.
Geralt|Took care of it. Trader said he'd give you a letter of credit - issued by the Vivaldis' bank.
Geralt|You and the merchant - what was that about?
Sukrus|Argh, why me sis wedded that ploughin' rotter is beyond me.
Geralt|That was your brother-in-law?
Sukrus|Prick-in-law, more like. Sweet-talked me at first: Skellige mead, we need barrels, we'll be rich men. So I brought it in. Then he starts goin' on about unforeseen storage costs, net-gross balances, and I dunno what else.
Geralt|Business and family just don't mix.
Sukrus|Exactly, mate.
Geralt|I'll be back. Take care.
Sukrus|See you, Geralt.
Geralt|Sorry, but you asked for it. I'm Geralt.
Sukrus|Sukrus. You did well, mate.
Sukrus|An ale to patch things? Come, we'll talk inside.
Geralt|Forgot how hard you Skelligers hit. I'm Geralt.
Sukrus|Sukrus. Ye ever need remindin', you know where to find me, mate.
Sukrus|What brings you here, Geralt?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Greetings, Hattori. See Sukrus already found you. You two agree to something?
Hattori|Yes, Geralt. I was forced to sell him a few axes at the wholesale price, but I was glad to do it. Thank you!
Geralt|About that warehouse…
Hattori|Yes, have you changed your mind? Will you borrow some of van Hoorn's stock?
Geralt|What're you getting me into? Borrow? Don't you mean steal?
Hattori|Stealing from a thief's no crime.
Geralt|It isn't? So what is it? Poetic justice? How did I get sucked into this? And why?
Hattori|It's simple! The best swords you've ever seen! Armor, trebuchets, catapults!
Geralt|All right, all right… Assuming I agree, how do you see this?
Hattori|Van Hoorn has his warehouse at the docks. The materials I need are very heavy. You must ask Sukrus to take his boys. One more thing – the crates I need will smell of ammonia.
Geralt|What'd you ask me to do again? Remind me.
Hattori|Visit van Hoorn's warehouse, with Sukrus, and obtain some crafting supplies. They shall smell of ammonia.
Geralt|Right. Fine.
Geralt|I'm working on it.
Hattori|Good luck, Geralt.
Geralt|Are you insane?
Hattori|Should you change your mind, you know where to find me.
Geralt|See you, Hattori.
Hattori|Till we meet again, Geralt.
Geralt|Finally accepting orders for swords again?
Hattori|Sadly, no. I lack certain crafting supplies.
Geralt|Lemme guess - Ernst van Hoorn's got a monopoly on them as well.
Hattori|Just so. He bought them cheap from sword makers abandoning the trade. Now he hoards them like a squirrel. But if you…? No, you'd never agree.
Geralt|Agree to what?
Hattori|I happen to know where van Hoorn keeps his hoard. It's more than he could possibly ever use. We could... borrow a little.
Hattori|Geralt! I've yet to thank you for your help with Tinboy! I'd never dreamt I could get away with paying so little. I have something for you.
Geralt|Thanks. How're things with Sukrus?
Hattori|All is in order, I can pay him now.
Geralt|Greetings, Hattori.
Hattori|Greetings, Geralt!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Greetings.
Sukrus|Oh, Geralt. How are things?
Geralt|Hattori's got a job for us.
Sukrus|Great, I was startin' to get bored.
Geralt|Wants us to ”borrow” a few crates from Ernst van Hoorn's warehouse. They'll smell of ammonia.
Sukrus|Hm, sounds doable. I know where van Hoorn stores his goods. The boys and I, we'll go there, look around. Meet us near the Sturgeon.
Geralt|Fine. When?
Sukrus|After dark, o' course. See ye there.
Geralt|Don't have time now. Need to do something.
Sukrus|Not now. Come see me after dusk.
Sukrus|All right. Be that as it may, me and the boys'll look around. See ye there later.
<|endoftext|>
Dwarf Man 03|How goes it, master witcher? Anythin' specific you lookin' for in van Hoorn's warehouse?
Geralt|Yarpen Zigrin sends his regards.
Dwarf Man 03|By Rhundurin, just don't nick everything. And hurry! Get it done while I'm in the privy.
Geralt|What I'm looking for's none of your business. Oughta just let me through.
Dwarf Man 03|Way's all clear.
Geralt|Gotta get inside.
Dwarf Man 03|To liberate what?
Geralt|A few crates of crafting supplies.
Dwarf Man 03|And what'll I tell Cleaver?
Geralt|That I knew the password?
Dwarf Man 03|Excellent work in Vergen, master witcher. And the password's "The lion sleeps tonight."
Geralt|Just happened to be passing by.
Dwarf Man 03|Don't play me for a fool, witcher. Yarpen holds ye in high regard - don't ruin it.
Geralt|But--
Dwarf Man 03|Come back when you're prepared to be honest.
Geralt|Just remembered I got something to do. I'll be back.
Geralt|Ahem.
Novigrad Trader 02|What the hell? It's you! I know you! Mister dwarf, this is the thieving swindler I told you about. Are you following me, you scoundrel?
Dwarf Man 03|Argh, ploughin' nonsense. I knows him, it's witcher Geralt. How goes it, master witcher?
Novigrad Trader 02|A witcher? Well, it all makes sense now. Mister dwarf, do not listen to him. The bastard will curse us.
Dwarf Man 03|Ye trade heads with a troll?! A friend o' Yarpen Zigrin's a friend o' mine. Now sod off 'fore I lose me temper. Now!
Geralt|Abracadabra, hocus pocus.
<|endoftext|>
Ernst Van Hoorn|Have you any idea whose warehouse this is, goatfucker?!
Sukrus|Oi, Geralt. It's the bloke Hattori told us about. The bugger who sleeps with Cleaver, or somethin'.
Novigrad Trader 02|Sukrus, why are you here…? With the sorcerer? Oh, now I see. That is one hell of a jest you've pulled!
Ernst Van Hoorn|Hattori sent you? That ploughing nonhuman'll be sorry his mother didn't strangle him with his navel string. But first we'll feed you to the crabs.
Novigrad Trader 02|Hands off my brother-in-law, swine. Only I can thrash him, understood?
Sukrus|Brother, let's mop the floor with these ploughin' Nordlings. Join us, Geralt! At 'em!
Geralt|Give 'em here, Sukrus!
Sukrus|Tuirseach!
Geralt|Slow down, Sukrus. Let's talk.
Sukrus|I've gotta save me brother-in-law. Attack!
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Trader 02|And it didn't surprise you the land was so cheap?! It's at the world's end!
Sukrus|Watch what ye say, rotter! You're talkin' about me fatherland. Tuirseach!
Novigrad Trader 02|And you truly believe this the best site for a shoppe trading in imported wines and liquors?
Ernst Van Hoorn|I wanted a forge…
Sukrus|Shut it, van Hoorn! How were I to know they only drink their fuckin' mead?
Novigrad Trader 02|They're from fuckin' Skellige, for fuck's sake! Flavor means fuck all to them, all they want is to get fucked up.
Sukrus|What the hell was I thinkin' makin' another deal with this scag?
Ernst Van Hoorn|It's all your fault. Piss off!
Novigrad Trader 02|An Skellig, for fuck's sake.
<|endoftext|>
Scoiatael Man 01|One step more and you'll gain a new hole in your head, dh'oine. What do you seek here?! Speak!
Geralt|Need to talk to your commander. It's important.
Scoiatael Man 01|I don't trust you.
Geralt|Figured as much when I saw your bow aimed at me… Still have me in your sight. And I'm just not prone to doing stupid things. I can assure you of that.
Scoiatael Man 01|I'll be assured when you hand me your weapons. C'mon, your swords. Drop them, and I'll take you to Vernossiel.
Geralt|Fine. Lead the way.
Geralt|Afraid I can't agree to that.
Scoiatael Man 01|An error. The last you'll ever make. Aep me!
Geralt|Set your weapon aside. You've killed enough humans already.
Scoiatael Man 01|No, no I have not - at least one more must die. Aep me!
Geralt|Oh, just out for a stroll. Getting some fresh air.
Scoiatael Man 01|I hope you find yourself amusing - but I'm not laughing. Aep me!
<|endoftext|>
Vernossiel|Vatt'ghern? Strange. No monsters trouble us.
Geralt|Might not trouble you. But the Redanians're convinced something prowls these woods. Hired me to kill it.
Vernossiel|Well they're mistaken. It's not the first time. There's no monster here, your work is done.
Geralt|This isn't a game. Men have died.
Vernossiel|Soldiers have died. Radovid's soldiers, serving the man who torments the Aen Seidhe from the Great Sea to the Blue Mountains. Soldiers who joined in massacres, tortured our brothers, raped our sisters. I shan't cry for them.
Vernossiel|And we'll not stop attacking those transports. We must eat, same as you. So you've a choice… Leave now and forget what you've seen. Or die.
Geralt|Do what you will. I'm not about to get involved.
Vernossiel|Give him his things… and toss in something from those transports. Wise decisions should be rewarded. Va fail.
Geralt|That sense of moral superiority - tiresome… and wrong. You're common bandits.
Vernossiel|Is that so? Then we shall treat you as common bandits would. Divedde vatt'ghern!
<|endoftext|>
Redanian Soldier 01|You're back, finally. Did you get the beast?
Geralt|There's no beast in the woods. Just Scoia'tael.
Redanian Soldier 01|Scoia'tael, you say? Thought we'd rid ourselves of those vermin. So, you gut them?
Geralt|Elves aren't monsters, so no… But I won't cry if anything happens to them.
Redanian Soldier 01|Hah, 'course you won't. A good nonhuman's a dead nonhuman, as my father would say. Can't give you no reward, you didn't do the job… but here's the pass I promised. For informing the proper authorities. We'll make quick work o' them.
Geralt|No. Searched the woods, didn't find a thing. Might've moved on.
Redanian Soldier 01|That or you're one shite witcher… What're you still doing here? You'll not get any coin - just a kick in the arse, if you're lucky. Get lost!
Geralt|No beast to speak of in the woods. Just elves from a Scoia'tael band that attacked the convoys. Here… their squirrel tails.
Redanian Soldier 01|Scoia'tael, you say? And I thought we'd exterminated the last of those vermin. And the nonhumans left had wised up. Well, seems we'll need to pacify 'em again. Make a list of all the long-ears around, hang every tenth one… that should do it.
Geralt|Yeah. Definitely.
Redanian Soldier 01|I see we're of a mind on this. You're a good man. Here, the gold I promised you… and the pass. Good luck.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Scribe 02|Firstly, we must have the proper effects. Let's have a look at our cards, shall we?
Novigrad Scribe 02|As I thought. Let's return once we've collected better cards, hm? And a thousand crowns for the buy-in, of course. Achoo!
Novigrad Scribe 02|Cards are in order… But can we afford the buy-in?
Geralt|We can.
Novigrad Scribe 02|Well, let's have a name, then, and we shall issue an entry ticket.
Geralt|Geralt of Rivia.
Novigrad Scribe 02|Gerard… of Rivia. The match will start soon, but the hoi polloi must first be driven out. We will please wait. Achoo!
Geralt|Not yet.
Novigrad Scribe 02|Then why bother us at all? Return with the coin.
Geralt|Heard you play for high stakes here.
Novigrad Scribe 02|Achoo! Yes?
Geralt|So long.
<|endoftext|>
Sacha|Well, well. Geralt of Rivia. And I was beginning to think this tournament would be a dreadful bore.
Sacha|I'm afraid winning coin from peasants, thugs and faux aristocrats is no great source of satisfaction for me.
Geralt|We know each other?
Sacha|Let's say we've some mutual acquaintances. I've heard many good things about you. In vivid detail.
Geralt|Hm, place like this, that's more a warning than a recommendation. What's your name?
Sacha|Sasha.
Geralt|Sasha what? Or maybe just skip right to telling me your real name.
Sacha|Place like this, Sasha will need to suffice.
Geralt|Come to the Passiflora often? Seem to know everyone.
Sacha|I'm here from time to time. I cannot say all the faces are familiar, but… that is Patrick Hazelnutt. Never goes anywhere without those three.
Geralt|Met a man once who traveled with two Zerrikanian warrior women as bodyguards. But those three…
Sacha|Have other talents, clearly. The halfling's Bernard Tulle, a farmer. Claims to play for pleasure, but everyone wants to win, don't they?
Sacha|Best beware of that one. He's not particularly fond of… others, outcasts, types like you. Ironic, since Finneas himself is a half-elf.
Sacha|And I'm certain you've heard of Count Tybalt. After all, he is the one who organized this tournament.
Geralt|Actually, I haven't heard of him.
Sacha|He's reputed to be fabulously wealthy. I can't say how true it is, but he was able to afford his title and the county that came with it.
Geralt|All right. See you later, Sasha.
Sacha|Try to chat up the other players before the tournament begins. We must all wait for Count Tybalt anyway.
<|endoftext|>
Bernard Tulle|I'm new to this, too.
Bernard Tulle|Took me ages to squirrel away the coin for the buy-in. Mushrooms are no quick route to riches, heheh.
Geralt|You really a farmer?
Bernard Tulle|I not look it? Got a little farmstead just outside the city. Could sit there for days just watchin' things grow.
Geralt|What's with the… smell?
Bernard Tulle|The smell?
Bernard Tulle|Anywho, mushrooms're all well and good, but one's gotta get away at times. My lady, she was in tears, said I'd get my throat slit in Novigrad…
Bernard Tulle|But I says to her, I says, "Hortensia, what a chance! The best players! The rarest cards!" She had to let me go.
Geralt|Good luck to you.
Bernard Tulle|Likewise! Now, that's the sportin' spirit! Not like that half-elf over there, who's been shootin' me murderous glares this whole time, heheh.
<|endoftext|>
Count Tybalt|Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to our closed gwent tournament. By "closed" I mean more than the mere elite nature of the event.
Count Tybalt|Anyone leaving the Passiflora before the end of play will be disqualified. That's rule number one.
Count Tybalt|Rules number two, three and four are: no fighting, dirty play or magic tricks.
Count Tybalt|We play for golden figurines. The winner will take them all, along with a monetary prize equal to nine times the buy-in.
Count Tybalt|Easy enough to calculate that nine have entered. The tournament will consist of three rounds. The finalist emerging from said shall play me.
Count Tybalt|Players will be paired by random draw. The groupings for the first round shall be read now.
Novigrad Scribe 02|Achoo! Finneas and Tim Knott.
Novigrad Scribe 02|Patrick Hazelnutt and Harald Featherbuns.
Novigrad Scribe 02|Gervalt of Rivia and Bernard Tulle.
Bernard Tulle|Hah, how about that!
Novigrad Scribe 02|Bramble Fruntenstroch and - achoo! - Madame Sasha.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Excellent.
Count Tybalt|A pleasant match to you all!
<|endoftext|>
Sacha|So, how did you fare in the first round?
Geralt|Tournament's over for me, I'm afraid.
Sacha|Hmm… Not necessarily. I've a proposition for you. Shall we discuss it upstairs? Lovely view from the terrace.
Geralt|All right.
Geralt|Honestly? I just came to play cards. Since I lost in the first round…
Sacha|I'd not expected you to give in so easily. Ah well - too bad.
Geralt|Honestly? I'm just here to play cards.
Sacha|Ah well. Too bad.
Geralt|Not bad. Guessing you won, too.
Sacha|I've the distinct impression my opponent was drunk. Had an altogether decent hand, but…
Geralt|Mighta had a hard time concentrating.
Sacha|Hmmm… Care to finish this conversation in private? I've a proposition for you. Meet on the terrace upstairs.
<|endoftext|>
Sacha|Mmmm, alone at last.
Geralt|What did you want to talk about?
Sacha|A cartload of coin - that's the grand prize, you know. I can't speak for you, but I'd prefer it didn't land in the wrong hands.
Sacha|And luck can be so undependable. Frankly, one should simply take the coin, subtly, you know, without bothering the others.
Geralt|Why tell me?
Sacha|I'm a woman. I'm in need of that coin. And Geralt of Rivia would never abandon a woman in need - or so I heard.
Geralt|Who'd you hear it from?
Sacha|Fringilla Vigo. She told me of your adventures in Beauclair. Apparently, you're dependable... so long as the cause is just.
Geralt|Fine, let's say I help you.
Sacha|I'll split the coin with you, of course.
Geralt|What's the plan?
Sacha|First, you must stay to the end of the tournament. I shall tell you the rest when the time comes.
Geralt|All sounds pretty mysterious, but… Fine.
Sacha|Excellent. Now that's settled, let's rejoin the others.
Sacha|I shall tell you all when the time is right. For now, just stay alert.
Sacha|And if you are eliminated, stay till the tournament's end. It'll be worth your while, you'll see.
Geralt|Split? What if I win the tournament?
Sacha|I shall have another proposition for you, then.
Geralt|Doesn't seem like a just cause to me.
Sacha|What if I told you my life depended on it?
Geralt|Hm, that changes things.
Geralt|Wouldn't believe you. Fringilla also mention I'm easy to manipulate?
Sacha|Ugh. She said you could be trusted. Very well, I'll have to manage on my own.
Geralt|Huh, as propositions go, this is not exactly what I was expecting. You don't seem like a--
Sacha|Thief? True, it's not my day job. Which is why I could use some help.
<|endoftext|>
Sacha|Before you ask - it wasn't me.
Geralt|Figured as much.
Sacha|My offer still stands. Perhaps you'd search for the coin with me?
Geralt|Agreed. Where do we start?
Sacha|We must get upstairs. Wait.
Sacha|I say, this witcher is Captain Hansen's good friend. He could examine the crime scene, charge only a trifling.
Novigrad Guard 01|A fee? But--
Sacha|We will, of course, collect it from the captain personally. How is his injury from the other week? Has it healed yet?
Novigrad Guard 01|Well… I'd heard it had.
Sacha|Splendid. We shall go upstairs at once.
Geralt|Rather not get involved in this, thanks.
Sacha|I see Fringilla exaggerated immensely. You're not dependable in the least. Goodbye.
Sacha|You promised to help me. I say we try to recover the coin together.
Sacha|An unexpected turn of events, but… Our agreement stands. We must try to recover the coin together.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Which one's Hortensia?
Bernard Tulle|The tall one.
Sacha|Masquerade's done, Tulle. Give us the coin.
Bernard Tulle|Masquerade - hah! Well put. Been watchin' you from the start, sweetheart. Though I ought to admit I thought you'd follow me alone.
Bernard Tulle|Told him who you are yet? No? I'm sure he'd love to hear it. Go on. Tell him. Or I'll tell Hortensia to break your fingers.
Geralt|What's this about?
Bernard Tulle|It's about Madame Sasha swallowin' my mushroom farming nonsense hook, line and sinker. When she should've been more vigilant.
Bernard Tulle|So, will you tell him who you spy for? Or would you rather scream it out?
Geralt|Let go of her. Step away.
Bernard Tulle|One of you restrain him. Then make sure he gets a good view.
<|endoftext|>
Sacha|Phew, good work. I did not, in fact, suspect him, whereas he clearly caught on to me long ago.
Geralt|Halflings can be unpredictable.
Sacha|At any rate, we've succeeded. Now to divide the coin…
Geralt|It's yours. You won the tournament.
Sacha|But you helped me get my prize back. We'll split it half and half.
Sacha|Know what? Let's have dinner at the Kingfisher. My treat. To celebrate my last day in Novigrad.
Geralt|I'd love to.
Geralt|Got plans for the evening.
Sacha|Hah! You lie. Fine, perhaps I'll get lucky the next time we meet.
Sacha|I found the key to the storehouse on Bernard's body, so we can leave by the door. And farewell, Geralt of Rivia.
Geralt|Heading back to Nilfgaard? That why you needed the coin?
Sacha|I see you miss very little.
Geralt|Still got a touch of an accent.
Sacha|Ah well. It seems I shall need a new trade anyway. I'm compromised in Novigrad, so… Ehh.
Geralt|Who were you before you became a spy?
Sacha|I don't rightly remember anymore. But I suppose you can call me Cantarella.
Geralt|That your real name?
Sacha|Well, almost…
Geralt|We oughta give it back to the tournament's winner.
Sacha|Tell me you jest.
Geralt|I do. Say we split it fifty-fifty.
Sacha|Phew… Know what? Let's have dinner at the Kingfisher. My treat. To celebrate my last day in Novigrad.
Geralt|Oh yeah, so what's this proposition that's supposed to convince me to share my winnings?
Sacha|No longer on the table. We retrieved the coin together, we shall divide it equally.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Rich Man 02|The last individual who tried to come in on my business - it took them a month to find him. Am I being clear, Chivay?
Zoltan Chivay|What's the fuss about? Can you not treat me as a bit of healthy competition?
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Why you even talkin' to him, Duke? I've always maintained two smashed knees are worth a thousand words.
Zoltan Chivay|Oh ho ho, Geralt! Glad ye came.
Geralt|What's this about?
Zoltan Chivay|Ach, nothin'. I just wanted you to meet my new pals 'fore they bugger the fuck off. 'Cause we were just partin', right?
Novigrad Rich Man 02|We'll have our reckoning yet, Chivay. Soon.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|What's this? Some flea-ridden mutant got you scared, Duke? Just say the word, I'll take care of 'im.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Take a peek at what he's got inside, then make the midget eat it. Sound good?
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Next time, Earl. Let's go.
Zoltan Chivay|Right! And don't show yer hides 'round here ever again! Ptooey!
Zoltan Chivay|Ech, well, that puts me up to the neck in fuckin' shite without a shovel.
Geralt|What's this all about? Doing business with them?
Zoltan Chivay|Exactly the ploughin' opposite. You see, Geralt, old pal--
Geralt|About to ask me for help, aren't you?
Zoltan Chivay|Thing is, I sorta kinda owe a wee sum to our mutual acquaintance, Francis Bedlam, the King of Beggars.
Zoltan Chivay|To pay off the debt, I've made up my mind to get serious about gwent.
Geralt|Getting better by the minute.
Zoltan Chivay|Not the playin' of it, mind ye, but the cards themselves. Rarest of 'em fetch princely sums these days. Sadly, that's not exactly arcane knowledge.
Zoltan Chivay|Got a buyer in heat for my collection, missin' just three cards. But Duke's dregs are all over my arse. So… whaddaya say, Geralt?
Geralt|Fine. We'll try to hunt down those cards. Which ones you need?
Zoltan Chivay|Fringilla Vigo, Isengrim, and John Natalis. Devilish hard to get hold of. Duke's been tryin', too, hasn't had any luck.
Geralt|Wait, you don't even know where to look for these cards?
Zoltan Chivay|Naah, it's not as bad as that. I'm bettin' Zed's got them. He quit fencin' recently, only deals in cards now.
Zoltan Chivay|Unfortunately, the arsewipe won't talk to me, not after I bought a one-of-a-kind Scoia'tael card out from under his nose. Would you mind goin' to see 'im?
Geralt|Zed… Hm, sounds familiar.
Zoltan Chivay|Big fish in the card pond. Has a shop along the south wall. And… thank ye, Geralt. I actually think I stand to pay off this debt now.
Geralt|No problem. See you later, Zoltan.
Geralt|You can handle this, Zoltan.
Zoltan Chivay|Sure. Or I might just discover I look great without ears… or hands. Apparently the King of Beggars accepts both as partial payment.
Geralt|Ugh, all right, I'll think about it.
Zoltan Chivay|Thanks. So long, Geralt.
Geralt|Shady, those guys. Who were they?
Zoltan Chivay|Er, puffed-up fish bladder's Duke. Word is he's out to be the new Whoreson Junior, but the bugger's missin' a helluva lot.
Zoltan Chivay|Specifically coin, influence, men, and class.
Geralt|And the other?
Zoltan Chivay|Earl. A scumjug like few others. Skin on my arse twitches at the sight of 'im.
Zoltan Chivay|Back in Mahakam we'd send sowbuggers like that down the coalface with a bundle o' powder and a leaky lamp.
Geralt|There a problem?
Zoltan Chivay|A problem? There some kinda problem here, gents? Nooo. Just wanted you to meet my new pals, 'fore they bugger the fuck off. 'Cause we're just partin', right?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|This debt of yours - to the King of Beggars…
Zoltan Chivay|Och! You rummage up the time to help me get them cards?
Geralt|Yeah. What're the cards you need?
Zoltan Chivay|Fringilla Vigo, Isengrim, and John Natalis. Devilish hard to get hold of. Duke's been tryin', too, hasn't had any luck.
Geralt|Wait, you don't even know where to look for these cards?
Zoltan Chivay|Naah, it's not as bad as that. I'm bettin' Zed's got them. He quit fencin' recently, only deals in cards now.
Zoltan Chivay|Unfortunately, the arsewipe won't talk to me, not after I bought a one-of-a-kind Scoia'tael card out from under his nose. Would you mind goin' to see 'im?
Geralt|Zed… Hm, sounds familiar.
Zoltan Chivay|Big fish in the card pond. Has a shop along the south wall. And… thank ye, Geralt. I actually think I stand to pay off this debt now.
Geralt|No problem. See you later, Zoltan.
Geralt|No, just asking.
Zoltan Chivay|Aaah. Well, thanks. Nothin's changed just yet.
<|endoftext|>
Zoltan Chivay|Ah, you're here. How'd you make out with Ravvy?
Geralt|Haven't been to the Sturgeon yet.
Zoltan Chivay|Fine, fine, Ravvy's not goin' anywhere. Let's clean out Caesar Bilzen first.
Zoltan Chivay|We'll do this - I'll chat 'im up while you sneak upstairs and search his cabinet of curiosities. I'm certain he keeps the card there.
Geralt|So what's in this cabinet?
Zoltan Chivay|Hah, no man knows. You'll be the first to see it.
Zoltan Chivay|I suspect it's either to do with buggery or metallurgy. But you can tell me once we're done. Let's go.
Geralt|Can't we just buy the card off him? Doesn't that sound simpler?
Zoltan Chivay|If I had a coin to spare, I'd sod off to Poviss. 'Sides, Caesar'd never sell Fringilla.
Zoltan Chivay|But don't you worry - he won't lose out on the deal. Got a bottle of Mahakaman spirit for him. A taste of the motherland's finest is worth more to an expatriate than some silly card.
Geralt|Thought you said Caesar doesn't drink?
Zoltan Chivay|Nooo, I said it's hard to have a drink with 'im on account of his rarely leaving home. Also why he's like to get pished as a priestess real quick.
Zoltan Chivay|Three rounds and you could walk out with everythin' in that cabinet, while singin' the Three Maids of Vicovaro at the top of your lungs.
Geralt|Got the Natalis card.
Zoltan Chivay|Excellent! Now we've just Caesar Bilzen to fleece, and we’ll be home free.
<|endoftext|>
Dwarf Man 01|Chivay?
Zoltan Chivay|Caesar Bilzen! Remember our quarrel about who's King of the Pontar?
Dwarf Man 01|The pike's King of the Pontar.
Zoltan Chivay|Ah, well, you see, I've come to convince you it's the catfish. And I do not come empty-handed.
Dwarf Man 01|Who's he?
Zoltan Chivay|Oh, him? Oh that's, that's Geralt.
Dwarf Man 01|Does, uh, Geralt fish?
Geralt|Yeah. Cast an earthworm the other day, caught this huuuge perch--
Dwarf Man 01|In the Pontar?
Zoltan Chivay|You betcha!
Dwarf Man 01|Ca-- Can't listen to this hogwash sober. Come in.
Geralt|Not really. Mainly hunt.
Dwarf Man 01|Good, that. One lyin' angler at the table's enough. Come on in.
<|endoftext|>
Zoltan Chivay|So what that zanders're eager biters, if they taste like shite in soapy water?
Dwarf Man 01|That's 'cause you're about as good a cook as a goat's arse is a clarinet. Just recenterly I took some fresh thyme--
Zoltan Chivay|Haha, and it tasted like thyme-flavored shite! Hahahaa…
Dwarf Man 01|Shut it! So, recenterly I-I took this thyme--
Zoltan Chivay|Geralt? Care to chime in? How's zander taste to you?
Geralt|Like shit.
Dwarf Man 01|All right. Grab your rods, we're off to the Pontar. Can't let this drivel stand, not in me own home…
Zoltan Chivay|Bilzen, did ye hear Vibbo Batilda last cast a pea and caught a young pike?
Dwarf Man 01|Aaa, cocksucker's lyin' like always! Pontar pike aren't so dimwitted to go after his rottin' peas. Ye need live bait.
Dwarf Man 01|Or night crawlers, though the pike aren't as eager. Don't know why… Once dug up a crawlie so fat and lovely, I started droolin', woulda eaten it myself!
Zoltan Chivay|Uh, I'm not so sure. Geralt, what do you and your pals use up at Kaer Morhen?
Geralt|Live bait.
Dwarf Man 01|You see, Chivay? He'll make a good angler yet. In some fifty, sixty years.
Zoltan Chivay|Heheheh. We'll wait and see.
Zoltan Chivay|Geralt, go fetch us another bottle.
Geralt|In a bit.
Zoltan Chivay|Now! You forgotten why we've come? How're we gonna get pished on one bottle?
Geralt|Fine, going.
Geralt|Right. Can see the bottom of this one.
Geralt|Bombs.
Dwarf Man 01|How's that?
Zoltan Chivay|Heheheh, Bilzen, heard many jests lately? Though, true enough, that one wasnae very funny.
Geralt|Excuse me for a minute.
Zoltan Chivay|Hahah. Humans - couldn't hold their Mahakaman spirit if their life depended on it.
Zoltan Chivay|Heh! Go on! And if you need help holdin' your hair back, give us a holler! Hahahahaha…
Geralt|Happen to like zander.
Zoltan Chivay|Cause you're a witcher! What you shove in them potions, shit's a delicacy to youse! Heheheh!
Dwarf Man 01|A witcher? Never mentioned he was a witcher…
Geralt|"Recenterly" isn't a word.
Dwarf Man 01|Who'd you bring along, Chivay? Shome ploughin' grammar purisht?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Zoltan? Time we were on our way.
Zoltan Chivay|Hehh, aye, 'spose so. It's grown late.
Dwarf Man 02|Greetings, Bilzen. We've a message for you from the boss.
Dwarf Man 01|Message? What kind o' message?
Dwarf Man 03|Mister Cleaver's very unhappy.
Dwarf Man 01|Now just a minute! If any discrepancies've cropped up in the books, I can explain everything.
Dwarf Man 03|Too late. Grab 'im! And you two - get lost!
Geralt|Leave him alone.
Dwarf Man 02|Cleaver'll pay extra for killin' the witcher. Well, hop to it, lads! Havnae got all day!
Geralt|Right. Just on our way out.
Dwarf Man 01|Wait now. Leavin' already? Where's that bottle you went to fetch?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Looks like Cleaver'll need a new clerk.
Zoltan Chivay|Hm, shame about Caesar. Though he didn't know shite about fish.
Geralt|Natalis card - only one missing now. High time we saw Ravvy.
Zoltan Chivay|Go. I should contact the buyer, agree on a place to make the transaction. See you, Geralt.
Geralt|Looked through Caesar's cabinet upstairs.
Zoltan Chivay|And?
Geralt|No wonder he wasn't eager to show it off. Nilfgaardian armor, a portrait of Emhyr…
Geralt|Joachim de Wett's skull, Vattier de Rideaux's dagger, the rope they hanged Skellen with…
Zoltan Chivay|Ugh, uck, shite. Disgustin' fellow. To think I shook hands with 'im…
Zoltan Chivay|Uh, but did you happen to take the rope? I know a few who'd pay a tidy sum for it. Some go in for that sort o' thing.
Geralt|No.
Zoltan Chivay|Ach, if ye say so…
Geralt|So, got the full set of cards. What now?
Zoltan Chivay|Now we collect a shiteload o' coin for them. Let's go.
Geralt|Also found a figurine - Nilfgaardian soldier. Magic spell on it of some sort, but I can't tell what kind.
Zoltan Chivay|Triss ought to know.
Geralt|Good idea. Take it by her house when I get a chance.
Geralt|Triss… is no longer around.
Zoltan Chivay|Ugh. Ehh, you've a soft heart after all, Geralt.
Zoltan Chivay|Oh, by the by, splendid job with that last one. Blood splatter nearly hit the ceilin'.
<|endoftext|>
Zoltan Chivay|What can you do? We meant well.
Zoltan Chivay|Oh, by the way, see anythin' interestin' upstairs? Anythin' worth goin' back for?
Geralt|A portrait of Emhyr?
Zoltan Chivay|Agh, never mind, then.
Geralt|Natalis card - only one missing now. High time we saw Ravvy.
Zoltan Chivay|Go. I should contact the buyer, agree on a place to make the transaction. See you, Geralt.
Geralt|So, got the full set of cards. What now?
Zoltan Chivay|Now we collect a shiteload o' coin for them. Let's go.
Geralt|Assire var Anahid's necklace?
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|How about that, it's the flea-ridden mutant. Join us, please. Ravvy loves company.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Look how 'appy he is to see yous. You 'appy, Ravvy?
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Argh!
Geralt|Sure he'd be happier if you stopped digging the point of that dagger in his back.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Ooohh, you're just sayin' that 'cause you don't know the situation. Our mutual friend Ravvy 'ere was just about to play for his life and, uh…
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Ow! You've got the card, what else d'you want?
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|If you'd just given it up 'stead of tryin' to cheat us, we'd be outta your hair already.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|As it is, that's all your fingers broken, so… seems the witcher'll have to play for you. Sound good?
Novigrad Thug Weak 02|Aaaaargh!
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|See? Ravvy's on board. Whaddaya say we add some spice to the game, raise the stakes - Ravvy's life and the Natalis card. Fancy that?
Geralt|Agreed.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Mhahaha! And here I thought you'd be no fun at all.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Let's play! Let's play!
Geralt|I got no use for Ravvy.
Novigrad Thug Strong 02|Tsk. This witcher's no fun.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Ah, at last. I fear the body's gone cold.
Zoltan Chivay|What is this?!
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Your would-be buyer handed us his coin and departed. More or less in that order. Now, the cards, please.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|I trust obtaining them wasn't too troublesome.
Geralt|Try it and find out.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Hahahah. You wish me to try? I'm not as foolish as Earl. You ought to know that by now.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Get to work, boys. The dwarf I wish to have alive. I must have a chat with him.
Novigrad Thug Strong 01|Doin' it.
Zoltan Chivay|Geralt, bastard's gettin' away with my coin!
Zoltan Chivay|Dammit, with our coin!
Zoltan Chivay|Chase the whoreson! I'll tend to the others.
<|endoftext|>
Zoltan Chivay|So? You get 'im? You get the coin?
Geralt|Yes.
Zoltan Chivay|And what about Duke? Finish him off?
Geralt|No. I let him go.
Zoltan Chivay|Oh, I knew I shoulda gone with ye. You know he has it in for me. He'll be doubly determined now.
Geralt|Doubt it. Think he's likely to quit the business… if he gets out of there alive.
Zoltan Chivay|Well, Geralt! What's your preference - coin or cards? I'd never hae managed without you, so you choose.
Zoltan Chivay|If ye want gold, it's not a problem. I'll find another buyer for these cards in a flash.
Geralt|Kinda curious how the cards might serve me.
Zoltan Chivay|Excellent! I'll take the coin to the King of Beggars right away. Surprise the prick!
Geralt|Good luck, Zoltan.
Zoltan Chivay|Thanks, Geralt. And remember - the catfish is the King of the Pontar!
Geralt|Rather have the coin.
Zoltan Chivay|It's yours. I'll still pay the King of Beggars on time. Oh won't that cocksucker be surprised!
Geralt|Mhm.
Zoltan Chivay|Ah, that's grand.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|About those cards…
Zoltan Chivay|You got them?
Geralt|Not yet.
Zoltan Chivay|Agh, so why're ye here? Miss me that much? This is no time for chit-chat, Geralt. We need to get those cards!
Geralt|Got the Isengrim card.
Zoltan Chivay|Show it here. Hah! They say elves are beautiful… Zed give you much trouble?
Geralt|Zed's dead. I ran into his murderers.
Zoltan Chivay|Won't cry over spilt Zed. What about the other cards?
Geralt|Didn't find the other cards.
Zoltan Chivay|Fuck, bugger musta sold them!
Geralt|Uhh, Zed's killers did say something about a ledger.
Zoltan Chivay|Ah, that's it! Zed musta written it all down. Bring me that ledger.
Geralt|Listen. Got Zed's ledger.
Zoltan Chivay|Show me. Hmmm… Entries show him sellin' the cards to Caesar Bilzen and Ravvy. Ach, coulda been worse. We need to pay 'em a visit.
Geralt|Zoltan, seems awful important to you… I'll try to get you those cards.
Zoltan Chivay|Thanks, Geralt. We can see Caesar together. Meet me outside his townhouse - gaudiest eyesore on Hierarch Square, he had the façade painted gold.
Zoltan Chivay|And if you wanna see Ravvy first, I'd look for him at the Golden Sturgeon if I were you.
Geralt|All right. See you later.
Zoltan Chivay|And no need to pussyfoot around with Ravvy. Beat 'im about the ears a bit, he'll cave. Well, good luck to ye, Geralt.
Geralt|Who's Caesar Bilzen?
Zoltan Chivay|Cleaver's clerk. A decent fellow, once, but so high and mighty now you can't drink with 'im, let alone go' fishin'.
Geralt|Fishing?
Zoltan Chivay|We met at the anglers' club - "The Pride of the Pontar." But Caesar don't show 'round there no more. So caught up in his new role, he almost never leaves his house.
Geralt|Least we won't have to run around town looking for him.
Geralt|Ravvy - who's he?
Zoltan Chivay|A common card sharp and a swindler. Boggles my mind where he got the coin for the Natalis card.
Zoltan Chivay|Ever since I gave 'im a smackin', things between us have been frosty, so you'll have to see him alone.
Geralt|Zoltan, think I've done what I was supposed to do. Gotta see to some other matters.
Zoltan Chivay|Shame, as I could use some help. But… well, change your mind, come and see me.
Geralt|Zoltan, sure this business isn't getting a little too dangerous? I mean, men are dying over these cards.
Zoltan Chivay|Just Zed. And believe you me, he wasn't an innocent bystander.
Zoltan Chivay|Sides, I'm certain you snuffed his killers out on the spot, so why worry? Tell me about the other cards, instead.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Ugh. First Earl - ha… Now it's my turn, is that it?
Geralt|Gimme the coin.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|And then, ugh… then you'll leave me be?
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Agh, ugh, leave me… Swiving drowners.
Geralt|You could use a witcher.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Ha ha. Highly amusing. If… if I give you the coin, will you leave me be?
Geralt|No. Rather make sure this was our last meeting.
Geralt|Yeah. You can go… if you're able.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Hah… What're my chances? With these wounds?
Geralt|Not high. So long.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Mentioned you have a problem.
Roche|Mhm. It's Ves. She took a couple of the lads across the river. Plans to hit the Black Ones at Mulbrydale.
Geralt|So? Sounds about like what guerilla fighters do.
Roche|Yes, when they are ordered to. Whereas I forbade her from leaving camp. Indefinitely.
Geralt|All right, so you've got a problem - insubordination. What am I supposed to do about it?
Roche|I doubt Ves has entered the village. More likely she and the boys lie in wait in the woods nearby. We must find her before she attacks. And stop her.
Roche|You're a good tracker. Help me.
Geralt|Count me in.
Roche|Thanks, Geralt. I'll owe you a favor.
Roche|Meet me in Velen, beneath the Hanged Man's Tree. It's just a short jaunt from there to Mulbrydale.
Geralt|Sorry, Roche. Rather not get involved. This is between you and Ves.
Roche|Mhm. Hard luck. Don't let me keep you.
Geralt|Why Mulbrydale? Why'd Ves go there?
Roche|The peasants from the village aided us earlier. The Nilfgaardians learned of this. Word got out they're planning a punitive expedition. Probably hang every fifth villager.
Geralt|Hm. Honestly, Ves' desire to save the villagers makes sense. What doesn't is your opposition to the plan.
Roche|War means death. Not only of for soldiers, for common folk, as well. You can't save them all. It's that simple.
Geralt|Funny. Had you for an idealist.
Roche|You were right to, are right to. But I have one ideal - a free Temeria. And I'm prepared to sacrifice anything for it.
Geralt|Don't trust Ves anymore?
Roche|Bollocks. She's prepared to die for me. That's not the problem.
Roche|Know what distinguishes a soldier from a common swashbuckler?
Geralt|The uniform?
Roche|It's a serious question.
Geralt|A rhetorical one. So instead of waiting for an answer, just… enlighten me.
Roche|Soldiers think tactically. They know when to strike, when to fall back. When to charge and when to hold.
Roche|Ves finds this difficult. She's impulsive, hot-tempered. Yet in guerilla warfare, one false step and you're fucked.
Roche|I confined her to the camp because I feared that sent out, she'd go rabid and make a mistake. I was right.
<|endoftext|>
Roche|It's the village below. Black with Nilfgaardians already. They're preparing to execute folk.
Geralt|No sign of Ves.
Roche|She may be impetuous, but she's not stupid. She's waiting for her moment. Probably attack after dusk, once--
Geralt|Shht.
Roche|What now?
Geralt|A trio. Lightly equipped. Sneaking closer. Over there, near the--
Ves|Death to the Black Ones!
Nilfgaardian Soldier 01|{Aep me! Cyrche! } [To me! They're attacking!]
Geralt|Looks like we're too late.
Roche|Idiot! Geralt, we have to help. Follow me!!
<|endoftext|>
Roche|Gods dammit, Ves! Have you gone completely mental?!
Roche|You ignore my orders. Go off on a suicide mission. And instead of donning a breastplate, you dash into battle, shirt open, navel and whatnot exposed!
Ves|You're not my father, Roche. You've no right to tell me what to wear.
Roche|But I am your commander, and you will obey me! Guerilla warfare. Warfare! It involves armies, for fuck's sake!
Ves|I could not abandon them. They helped us.
Roche|It's a soldier's job to kill, Ves, not save, not rescue. If that is not to your liking, join the Sisters of Melitele, study to be a healer. Fucking hell…
Roche|Give me your weapon. You'll get it back when you wise up - if you wise up. Move out!
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|Akh akh akh… ptooey… akh!
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|{Hvren…  } [Fuck...]
Geralt|One left.
Ves|You took my weapon, Roche… So I must manage with my bare hands.
Roche|Leave him alone. There are corpses enough here.
Ves|What?!
Roche|You heard me.
Ves|I did and I can't believe it! He came here to murder civilians. He's seen us. Will you have him return to his camp and report?!
Roche|Emhyr knows we can kill his men. Let him learn that we can also show mercy.
Geralt|Roche… Noble of you and all, but occasionally, I work for Nilfgaardians. Frankly, I don't want any trouble.
Roche|I don't like this… But so be it, you certainly don't deserve to suffer as a result.
Ves|Well said, Geralt. A good Black One's a dead Black One. I'll strangle the bug--
Roche|Stand aside. I'll do this.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|{Neen... Tròcair!!! } [No… I beg you!]
Geralt|Roche is right. Besides, killing a defenseless--
Ves|What is with you, Roche? Did the witcher take your stones? They're sadists! He's the occupier!
Roche|I will explain later..
Roche|You, Nilfgaardian. Piss off.
Nilfgaardian Officer 01|{Mòran taing. N'ees dhearmad a va-- } [Thank you. I shall not forget you d--]
Roche|Go, before I change my mind.
Geralt|Uh-oh. Got yourselves a prisoner.
Ves|We don't take prisoners.
Roche|Agh. We should go before a patrol comes along. Thank you, Geralt… Ever need any help, you know where to find me.
<|endoftext|>
Dijkstra|Geralt. You're here, good.
Geralt|Might've chosen a more secluded spot to plot an assassination.
Dijkstra|It's on everyone's mind, many'd like to do it, so there's nothing to fear.
Dijkstra|Besides, this venue's got a tradition in this domain. Might even consider it fabled. Falka planned her revolt here… by extension, King Vridank's murder, too.
Geralt|Comparing yourself to Falka? Far as I recall, no one in Redania's annals has a bloodier reputation.
Dijkstra|Her rebellion changed the course of history - that's what we have in common. In terms of blood, we aim only to shed Radovid's.
Dijkstra|I'm pleased you're willing to play a part. Must admit I wasn't certain you'd show.
Geralt|Got your invitation, decided to come. That simple. Let's get down to business.
Dijkstra|I believe you know my associate.
Geralt|Roche? You, here?
Roche|Retired intelligence operatives - we've a club.
Geralt|Defended a king once… Ready to assassinate another, now?
Roche|Not proud of it. Yet… I considered all the options and found none better.
Roche|Radovid's proven many times he only ever forwards his own interests. When Kaedwen asked for help, he invaded. When I begged him to support Vizima's defense, he showed me the door.
Roche|The war nears its end, we've come to a decisive phase. We must act quickly.
Roche|I've no illusions. Only a dead Radovid means a free Temeria.
Geralt|All right, what do you want from me?
Roche|One of our co-conspirators ventured out to meet an informer. He's not returned, yet the plan's success hinges on what he's learned.
Roche|We've got to find him. And you're the best tracker around.
Geralt|Tracker, huh? Really.
Geralt|Anything else you can tell me? Where this associate was last seen, for instance?
Dijkstra|He's traveling as a journeyman. Itinerant cobbler - that's his cover. He was first to venture across the Pontar, most probably did so via the Redanian checkpoint. We've a man there who should know more. Calls himself Gregor.
Geralt|Fine. I'll talk to Gregor.
Roche|Thank you. And try not to draw too much attention… if you can.
Roche|Remember, the future hinges on the success of this mission. The future of Temeria, the future of the North.
Geralt|I know. I'll try not to fuck it up. See you.
Dijkstra|We're counting in you, Geralt.
Geralt|Know what - rather not get involved. Stinks of politics from miles away.
Dijkstra|Geralt, give it some thought. If you change your mind, find Gregor. Talk to him.
Geralt|I'll consider it. Promise you that much. But that's all.
Geralt|Let a Redanian soldier in on your plan to murder Redania's king?
Dijkstra|Ahh, you see? There are even some Redanians who cannot abide Radovid's policies.
Dijkstra|And when simple soldiers notice something's not quite right, well, then it's time to act.
Geralt|How's that work? Seems to me Radovid is Temeria's ally.
Roche|Only as long as my guerillas do what pleases him, support his troops. Once he wins the war, he'll not acknowledge the previous borders nor wish to restore them.
Roche|He dreams of a northern empire. As long as he lives, Temeria will never be free.
Dijkstra|But we didn't bring you here to bore you with politics. Radovid's a threat to Triss and Yennefer. Remember that. That ought to interest you most.
Geralt|Thought about what you said… that Triss and Yen would never be safe as long as Radovid was alive.
Dijkstra|You better believe it. Well, I'm pleased we've arrived at an understanding. To the matter at hand.
Geralt|Came by 'cause I'm curious.
Dijkstra|But you will help?
Geralt|We'll see. Need to know what you expect of me, first.
<|endoftext|>
Dijkstra|Anyone see you come in?
Roche|No one apart from Madame Serenity and your lackey.
Dijkstra|Off the street, I mean.
Roche|No one. Nerves getting the better of you?
Dijkstra|I'm not nervous - just cautious. A trait you ought to nurture as well.
Roche|I know, and I am. Wound about the streets for a time to lose any tails.
Roche|I've worked in intelligence as long as you have. I need no lessons in spy craft.
Roche|Thank you for agreeing to do this, Geralt.
Roche|The sooner you finish, the better.
Dijkstra|Nice to chat and all, Geralt, but don't you have a job to do?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Looking for Gregor.
Redanian Soldier 03|You've found him. Who're you?
Geralt|Geralt of Rivia. Dijkstra sent me.
Redanian Soldier 03|Been expectin' someone. Let's take a walk.
Geralt|Nice job decorating your guard post.
Redanian Soldier 03|By orders of our gracious and merciful ruler, the good king…
Geralt|What was their crime?
Redanian Soldier 03|One on the right's a pellar from a village nearby. Gave some bloke the wrong advice, bloke's mates informed on him.
Redanian Soldier 03|Neighbor held a grudge against the one on the left. Accused him of witchcraft.
Geralt|Just humans at each others' throats. That's not Radovid's fault.
Redanian Soldier 03|Hm, who do you think set down the laws that mean folk hang for such "offences"?
Geralt|Let's talk. Must know why I'm here.
Redanian Soldier 03|Take it it's about our cobbler friend. Yeah, he came through here on his way out. Didn't come back, though.
Redanian Soldier 03|Patrol went out yesterday, reported an abandoned cart a ways off the road. Aimed to go out there, see if it's his. Couldn't get away.
Geralt|Thanks. Good enough to start with. Farewell.
Redanian Soldier 03|Hold on. You got a pass? Won't get back through without one.
Geralt|No, I don't.
Redanian Soldier 03|Here. Anyone asks, you didn't get it from me.
Geralt|Right. Thanks.
Geralt|Yeah, I got one.
Redanian Soldier 03|All right. Good luck.
Geralt|Thanks, see you.
Geralt|Seem to have lost all respect for the king. Why serve him?
Redanian Soldier 03|What'm I to do? I was born a Redanian, I won't desert.
Redanian Soldier 03|Besides, I enlisted when Vizimir was still on the throne. Now that was a good king, wise and just.
Redanian Soldier 03|Radovid's somethin' else. He's got war on the brain. And I don't want Redania to look anythin' like that.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Greetings.
Troll_3|Away go witchygo. Shoeses pick me.
Geralt|I can see that. Just wondering how those shoeses wound up here.
Troll_3|Here shoeses grows. Like to mushroo.
Geralt|Shoes don't sprout from the ground. You see who left them behind here?
Troll_3|Hmm… Hmm… Speakno Rogg. Or angergets Ogg and Pogg.
Geralt|Ogg and Pogg - those your friends?
Troll_3|Finderingers great Ogg-Pogg! Human finder on bigshoes cart, shoes biglike so!
Geralt|Mhm. What'd they do this human?
Troll_3|Ogg Pogg mans cavetotake. Thereover.
Geralt|D'you eat him?
Troll_3|Naaaaayno, bonymans, stringymans. Blech…
Troll_3|Oggmake mans shoesesmake. For Ogg, Pogg and Rogg shoesesmake.
Geralt|You even need shoes?
Troll_3|Shoeses on humanses, shoeses wants Ogg, Pogg and Rogg.
Troll_3|Biglords trollers be, like humanses.
Geralt|So long.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Thaler?
Geralt|Shoulda known. Who better to teach trolls how to cuss.
Talar|Geralt?! My, my, been bloody years.
Troll_2|This who?!
Talar|Relax, Ogg, this bugger's an old friend of mine.
Troll_1|Buggafrenold go! Or wes in soup throw!
Geralt|I'd make for an awfully veiny morsel.
Talar|Right, true that. Just look at the ploughin' bastard - naught but skin and bones.
Talar|Well, gentletrolls, high time I traveled on. You, uh, practice what I taught you. Give you a fuckin' exam next time I come through.
Troll_2|Tala go no! Tala sit… sit arsedown! Tala sockcuck shoeses make!
Geralt|Got no time to negotiate with trolls. Step aside, Thaler.
Geralt|Now let's all stay calm. Thaller'll be back. He just… needs to come with me… we'll, uh, get some leather for your shoes.
Troll_2|Heeeeeh?
Talar|Listen to Geralt. He's tellin' the ploughin' truth.
Troll_1|Heeeeeh?
Talar|Look at your feet - they're fuckin' mammoth. Need a damn bale o' leather to make shoes for 'em. Understand?
Talar|Me and Geralt, we'll get some cocksuckin' leather. Then I'll come back and make your blasted shoes for you.
Troll_2|Shoeses Pogg for? And Rogg for?
Talar|Two pairs, for each of you gnarled pricks.
Troll_2|Hmm… Tala go. But backcome must!
Talar|Knew you buggers were good mates. Sit tight. Be back in a bit!
Geralt|I can see you've made friends. But Thaler needs to come with me.
Troll_2|Blood nowhere Tala go! Tala shoeses makes!
Geralt|But I need him.
Troll_2|Tala here stay. You shoeses got! Ogg shoeses gotnot, Rogg gotnot, Pogg gotnot.
Troll_2|Tala shoeses make, Tala go.
<|endoftext|>
Troll_1|Notalky! Shoeses make!
Troll_2|Ogg angergets and you diemake!
Talar|When someone pisses you off, you needn't ploughin' kill him. It's not your only arsebitin' recourse.
Troll_2|When but Ogg hitmake, humanses alltime die.
Talar|So don't bloody hitmake. Yell at 'em, that's good enough.
Troll_1|Heeeeeh?
Talar|You walk up to the bloke, bare your teeth, furl your brow and say, "Fuck off, you miserable cunt." Understand?
Talar|All right. Let's, uh, move to some exercises.
Talar|Repeat after me: "You thrice fucked whore - ploughed, buggered and blowin'." Take turns. Ogg?
Troll_2|Errr… You… Yooooo…
Talar|Argh, all right. Pogg? Maybe you could give it a shot?
Troll_1|Errr…
Talar|Agh, guess we should start with something simpler.
Talar|Err, gimme a minute.
Talar|Right, got it. We'll start easy.
Talar|"Fu-cking cunt." Repeat that.
Troll_2|Fu… Fu… Fuggy?
Talar|Shite, no! "Fucking cunt!" Bugger me, you're a moron…
Troll_2|Ogg no morony! Ogg Tala finder! Ogg finderinger!
Troll_2|And you cobbleringer, shoesesmake! Notalky!
<|endoftext|>
Troll_2|O yoooooo!
Troll_2|Fu… Cu… Cuckfunt!
Talar|Heheh, didn't I say you were a moron, Ogg?
Talar|Told you a hundred times - "fucking cunt." Not bloody "cuckfunt!"
Troll_2|Ogg angergets! Ogg hitmake! Diemake!
Talar|Infernal fuckin' mess. We should sod off.
Troll_2|Diekill… Cu… Cucky!
Talar|Fuck me, Ogg, you're never gonna get it.
Troll_2|Ogg bigforce! Cobbleringer in gosoup!
Troll_2|Rooogg! Here comes! Helps Rogg!
<|endoftext|>
Talar|Just happen to be passin' through, or did someone send you to find me?
Geralt|Roche and Dijkstra.
Talar|Ah! Mean they've not forgotten me? That's nice.
Talar|Though I am grateful you came to get me, Geralt.
Talar|Must have a lot on your mind, all those monsters to kill…
Geralt|Heard you three are planning to do some killing of your own.
Talar|Huh? They tell you? Clowns.
Geralt|Kinda. Didn't offer any details, though.
Geralt|Maybe you'd be willing? Gesture of gratitude?
Talar|Sorry, mate. If they were mum, I've got to be mum.
Geralt|Hm. Be that way.
Geralt|How'd you even wind up out here?
Geralt|Nilfgaard occupied land now.
Talar|You sayin' the Black Ones have no use for cobblers?
Geralt|Probably brought their own.
Talar|Brought fuck all, as I see it. Amateurs in uniform.
Talar|And you'll not find a better cobbler than Thaler anywhere in the North!
Geralt|Yeah, right.
Talar|You doubt me?
Geralt|You're a spy. And you're working with Roche and Dijkstra now.
Geralt|Doubt you went out there to fix Nilfgaardian boots.
Talar|Ah, I see you've thought about this.
Talar|I admit it. Cobbler act's my cover.
Talar|Who takes an interest in cobblers? No one.
Talar|You sit there, doin' your work, hammerin' on that sole, and blokes beside you talk.
Talar|Bollocks, mostly. But sometimes they'll say somethin' interestin'.
Geralt|Like?
Talar|That's all I'm willin' to say.
Talar|Got to admit, you have a way with trolls. Ever thought of having children?
Geralt|Children aren't trolls and vice versa. Besides, witchers're sterile.
Talar|Ugh, you've not changed a bit.
Talar|Still tart as rotting rhubarb.
Talar|Truth be told, you didn't have to kill 'em.
Geralt|Looking for apprentices?
Talar|Fuckin' hell, them? Don't even think about it. I'd kill myself with those idiots.
Talar|But they were likeable as idiots go.
Geralt|Didn't have time for nonsense.
<|endoftext|>
Talar|Thanks again, Geralt. I'll take it from here.
Talar|And I'll be sure to tell Roche and Dijkstra how you buggered Ogg and his mates sideways. As I see it, they'll be so impressed they'll shit themselves.
Geralt|So what'll you do now?
Talar|What do you mean? Head back to Novigrad. Dijkstra, Roche and I've got a master plan to set in motion.
Geralt|I'll ask again - details?
Talar|Forgive me, mate. I ploughin' can't.
Talar|See, were it just up to me, I'd spill it loud and proud. You're trustworthy, like no one else I know.
Talar|But I'm not on my own, so blooming unilateral decisions are outta the question. Trap stays shut, I'm afraid.
Geralt|Right. Got you.
Geralt|Tell me, you were a fence in Vizima. How'd you become a cobbler?
Talar|Picked the least suspicious profession.
Talar|The fence thing - shite cover. Pissed too many folk off. I didn't need the attention.
Talar|Thought about bein' an innkeep. You meet a lot of folk, you know, tossers mostly, but willlin' to talk about all sorts of things. Problem is, you're tied down like a mutt on a chain - one and the same yard all the time.
Geralt|Whereas a cobbler travels everywhere.
Talar|Better believe it, heheh. Even cobbled together this fancy rollin' stall.
Geralt|Lovely.
Talar|Bloody bullseye - I've made a small fortune out of it since the war started.
Talar|Those pricks in uniform are always marchin'. Know what happens when their cocksuckin' boots disintegrate? Their feet bleed, blister up. Not a soldier out there wouldn't sell his mother for a comfy pair of combat boots.
Geralt|So long, Thaler. And good luck.
Talar|Oh, I can bloody use it. Radovid's one crafty whore with the clap. But we'll figure a way round that twat.
Talar|Soon the whole fucking North'll be blatherin' about how he got fucked.
Geralt|Careful it's not also blathering about three assassins drawn and quartered.
Talar|Heheh. Fear not, Geralt. We know what were doin'. Farewell.
Talar|And I'll be sure to tell Roche and Dijkstra how you sliced up those dimwitted cocksuckers. As I see it, they'll be so impressed they'll shit themselves.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Marksmanship. Feel a need to do some shooting.
Geralt|Roach could use some wind in her mane. Let's go for a ride.
Geralt|How about some swordplay?
Geralt|Apply all the skills you mentioned on a daily basis. And against monsters, not targets and dummies.
Geralt|Don't need any training. Going straight to the tourney grounds to sign up.
Guillaume|I shall be forever in your debt! Now, we must ensure you are not eliminated from the tourney before you can meet Vivienne.
Geralt|Meaning?
Guillaume|Could you show me how you shoot, ride and fight, perchance? And you must learn the tourney rules, know how to apply them in practice.
Guillaume|I-I did not mean to suggest I doubt your abilities. Everyone must train, even a witcher.
Guillaume|Besides, the tourney contests must surely differ, require skills you don't usually apply. Races, above all. The choice is yours… where shall we start?
Geralt|Fine. I'll look into it. Gotta admit, piqued my curiosity.
Geralt|Hardly your regular job, this. Not often I gotta take part in a tourney to fulfill a contract. Fee can't be anything ordinary, either.
Guillaume|I am no magnate to command heaps of coin. But naturally, I shall award you a just amount. How much do you demand?
Geralt|This tourney - how's it work, exactly?
Guillaume|It is the year's grandest and most important contest! Knights from all corners come to face off for the grand prize - and more importantly, for glory.
Guillaume|A demanding test of knightly prowess in horsemanship, marksmanship and fencing. I qualified for the first time, had great hopes of winning.
Guillaume|Yet--
Geralt|Yeah, I get it. Anything for Vivienne.
Geralt|All sounds pretty interesting, I guess. Still, can't look into Vivienne's troubles just now.
Guillaume|I see - state matters take priority. Yet come see me forthwith should you have a change of heart.
Geralt|Tell me more about Vivienne? Who is she, what's her story?
Guillaume|She is Her Enlightened Highness' lady in waiting. Her mother was a lady-in-waiting, her father, a knight. That is all I've learned, for the duquessa grows angry when asked about her. Vivienne spends her days within the palace walls.
Guillaume|Yet we are in luck, for she has been named the tourney's patroness this year. Thus, each participant will be granted an audience with her.
Geralt|Got a problem, then. See, I'm not a participant.
Guillaume|I've devised a solution, already. You shall take my place in the lists and thus gain the chance to speak to her.
Guillaume|I was looking forward to winning the tourney, very much so, yet for Vivienne, I'm prepared to sacrifice anything!
Geralt|Sound you heard - she mighta just had a sore throat.
Guillaume|Had I thought it possible the sound was natural, I never would have taken up your precious time.
Geralt|Notice any other strange behavior, additional symptoms?
Guillaume|No, Vivienne's avoided me wholly since the first encounter. But folk gossip…
Geralt|What about?
Guillaume|They say she's secretive, that no one ever sees her after dusk, that she's wont to suddenly disappear…
Geralt|Nothing unusual about any of that.
Geralt|What makes you think she might be cursed?
Guillaume|You must keep all I say to yourself, I beg you. I would never dare to be so indiscreet, normally, yet I am troubled about her, for her.
Guillaume|Vivienne shuns the company of others. Though the fairest maid at court, she keeps men at a distance. I thus determined I would resort to trickery…
Geralt|Trickery? That even befitting of a knight?
Guillaume|In war - yes. And what is love, if not battle? As it were, one evening I crouched in hiding outside her seamstress' home. As Vivienne emerged from it, I too emerged, ever so gently but convincingly collided with her, then promptly offered to escort her home.
Guillaume|She consented. At first, all augured well. I proposed a more scenic route, she agreed. I made kindly forays into conversation, and she even began to respond as we neared the end of our route…
Geralt|Then suddenly…
Guillaume|Then suddenly, mid-speech, from her mouth there flew a most hideous shriek. I stopped stone-cold in my tracks, while she turned red, then promptly ran off. I did not give chase… that time.
Guillaume|I attempted to approach her on several ensuing occasions. To learn what had happened, for I feared she had become entangled in some trouble.
Guillaume|I noted that often, come night, she ventures into the woods, where I've seen her walk about a glade near a pool. I've striven on occasion to follow her, but lost track each time. It seemed then she'd melted into the air.
Geralt|Lemme guess - she suddenly grew cold, haughty and distant, though the night before she was flirtatious and alluring?
Guillaume|Tut-tut, witcher - you jest, yet the matter is grave. Though, true, the lady in question is dear to my heart - I shall not deny it.
Guillaume|I fear she has fallen victim to ill magic, and knows no one she could turn to for help.
Geralt|Your wound? Feeling better?
Guillaume|It's healing splendidly, though I'm to avoid trouble for some time. To be frank, that is precisely why I wished to speak with you.
Geralt|Want me to stand in for you, take on some trouble on your behalf?
Guillaume|That could very well be the case. You see, there is a maiden - nay, a lady. I suspect someone's cast an ill spell upon on her. A curse, perhaps.
Guillaume|Witcher! The matter with Vivienne - have you reconsidered? You, of all those I know, could find a way to help her!
Guillaume|Witcher! I've a matter of prime urgency and import! I must speak to you!
Guillaume|Vivienne is worth every copper. But this amount I simply do not have. You ask too much.
Guillaume|I have comrades I can ask, they would surely lend me coin, yet even that would not be enough. Could you not lower your fee somewhat?
Guillaume|Agreed. That is an amount I can indeed muster.
Guillaume|The matter is of grave importance to me, yet you clearly jest, continue to mock. We shall reach no agreement this way.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Knight 09|For honor! Sir, we shall cross swords if you'll allow it!
Toussaint Knight 04|I can fight.
Toussaint Knight 06|You need not ask me twice!
Toussaint Knight 08|I will stand and fight. But be warned, I do nothing half-way!
Toussaint Knight 01|You wish to spar? Why not.
Toussaint Knight 03|The knights' codex commands constant improvement.
Geralt|No harm in going again. Practice makes perfect, even for witchers.
Geralt|Had enough. Rather not wear my horse down before the real race.
Guillaume|Where to now?
Guillaume|If you wish to know my thoughts, were I you I would train on the race course ahead of all else.
Geralt|Let's do some riding. Roach'll like that.
Guillaume|Excellent idea.
Geralt|Be nice to swing, do some footwork, work up a sweat.
Guillaume|Very well. We shall practice infantry combat, one on one. Each knight opts for his own method. Rainfarn, for instance, fights halberd in hand.
Geralt|Time for some target practice, I think.
Geralt|Ah, trained enough, I think. High time we saw to your Vivienne.
Guillaume|She is not mine. Not yet.
Guillaume|Now you must go to the inscription tent. Honor and glory are all true and good, but your scrolls must be in order.
Geralt|Come back to this later.
Guillaume|Will you give it another go? I can set out more dummies.
Geralt|Think I've seen enough. Sorry to be blunt, but the simplest witcher contract demands more skill than this kind of combat.
Geralt|Could probably use some more practice. Usually fight monsters, not knights.
Geralt|Had enough for now. Come back to this later, maybe.
Guillaume|I expected you to do well, but not that well.
Guillaume|Do you wish to train more?
Guillaume|Will you fight again?
Guillaume|Remember, you will lose should you wander outside the arena.
Geralt|Done enough shooting.
Geralt|Gladly give it another try.
Geralt|We'll practice some more later.
Guillaume|Once more?
Guillaume|Sirs, there will be a new entrant in the tourney. He wishes to duel one of you, to warm his muscles.
Guillaume|Who shall challenge him?
Guillaume|The tourney's race differs from others you might have taken part in. You shall not ride against any opponent.
Geralt|How's it a race at all ,then?
Guillaume|It's a race against time! The true track begins in the arena, runs round the tourney grounds, then finishes again in the arena.
Guillaume|The training track, however, lies beyond the arena. We shall go there now.
Guillaume|You will team with other knights to fight. The clash simulates a true skirmish during battle.
Guillaume|Come the end, you shall fight a duel. It will determine your place on the podium.
Guillaume|I always liked the duels the best… but now I can think only of my Vivienne. In the end, it is good you will replace me. I sense I would simply be distracted this time.
Guillaume|Wrong target! One point for your opponent!
Guillaume|The marksmanship contest shall pit you against another for the best time and score.
Guillaume|He who hits all his targets first wins.
Geralt|Hope my aim's as good as that cupid's who shot you.
Guillaume|Sometimes when you speak, I miss the meaning entirely.
Guillaume|Hit the red targets!
Guillaume|Come with me.
Guillaume|I've always believed there is nothing quite like a duel to get one's blood coursing.
Guillaume|Stand at the center of the training ground. A knight will approach and challenge you.
Guillaume|All is ready! Now listen, for it can be quite the challenge. Along your route stand dummies and targets. The dummies you may cut with your blade, the targets you must hit from your crossbow.
Guillaume|The time you have to complete the course shall increase each time you land a strike, be it with blade or bolt. It may sound simple enough, yet I've seen many a knight fail this contest and hang his head in shame.
Guillaume|During the race proper, judges throughout the course shall tally your points. For now, you may ride unperturbed by those matters.
Guillaume|So, have you had enough? Or do you wish to ride again?
Guillaume|Do you wish to practice fighting a moment longer?
Guillaume|Do descend from your horse, Geralt. This is unmounted combat.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|I swear on Her Grace's illustrious garter to respect the chivalric virtues in competing.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|May the gods succor you in your endeavors to overcome. Sign here, please, then fill out these forms.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|That is all I need from you. Now, as arranged by Guillaume, you shall be fitted with appropriate armor for the tourney.
Geralt|Hm. Shiny.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|You have also been assigned a tent for the tourney's duration. It stands near the arena. Good luck!
Geralt|I solemnly vow on the heron that in competing I'll respect the chivalric virtues.
Geralt|I vow on the love of my lady, whose name I choose not to divulge, to respect the chivalric virtues.
Geralt|I vow on the love of my lady, Triss Merigold, to respect the chivalric virtues.
Geralt|I vow on the love of my lady, Yennefer of Vengerberg, to respect the chivalric virtues.
Geralt|Don't feel like making a vow.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Custom allows even for this possibility.
Geralt|You say something about vows?
Toussaint Noble Man 03|As is our custom, knights make vows to which they hold for the duration of the tourney. Each swears on something which to him represents his most cherished virtue.
Geralt|Feels like I know everything I'd ever want to know about chivalric tourneys.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Splendid. In that case, you must make your vow. Upon what would you like to swear it?
Geralt|Guillaume told me a bit about the contests. Rather make sure I'm clear on them, though.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|An admirable thirst for knowledge! There are contests three. A shooting range, where you will compete side by side with an opponent.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|A horse race, during which you will seek to complete the course within a specified time. Any targets hit with bolts or dummies felled with blade will increase the time you have.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Finally, the group melee in the arena, crowned with a duel against last year's champion.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|As each contest ends, its results will be posted on the board outside my tent. This way all will be apprised of who leads at any given moment.
Geralt|Convenient.
Geralt|Gonna come right out with it - I'm a sucker for prizes.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|The winner of each contest shall receive a trophy.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Whoever has the best result once all contests have played out shall face last year's champion in a final duel for glory and the title.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Should you defeat the reigning champion, the grand prize will be yours. This year - a sword forged especially for this occasion by the one and only Cornelius of Assengard, a famed master weaponsmith.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Her Illustrious Highness had it brought all the way from Nazair.
Geralt|I'm Geralt. Not about to fight under a false name.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|You may now take the shield bearing your crest.
Geralt|I'm a witcher. Shields aren't something witchers ever use in combat.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Who mentioned using it in combat? Not I. The shield commemorates your participation in the tourney. You may take it as a souvenir.
Geralt|Hm. In that case, thanks.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Have you been instructed as to the tourney's challenges, prizes and vows? If not, I do hope you will allow me to tell you about them.
Geralt|The honorable Ravix will do.
Geralt|Kinda curious what you could've learned about Geralt of Rivia.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|In the year 1267 a certain Geralt, a member of the witchers' guild, was knighted by Queen Meve and dubbed Geralt of Rivia.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|This was in honor of his distinguished service at the Battle of the Bridge, said structure spanning the Yaruga. But I wager you know of which battle I speak?
Geralt|Mhhh, yeah… Those were the days. Cahir and I led a fistful of Nordlings against an entire Nilfgaardian battalion. Won that battle just because we absolutely had to cross the river.
Geralt|Ravix of Fourhorn? How'd you manage to dig that up?
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Here in Toussaint, we treat heraldry very seriously. One visit to the Ducal Archives - that is all I needed to acquire the necessary information.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|"Ravix of Fourhorn" was the name under which you attended a feast honoring Princess Pavetta, daughter of Queen Calanthe of Cintra, on the occasion of her fifteenth birthday.
Geralt|That's actually right.
Geralt|Greetings. Wanna join the lists.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Naturally. We must first see to formalities, however. At Guillaume's request I have looked into your personal history in its heraldic aspects.
Geralt|Really. What'd you come up with?
Toussaint Noble Man 03|My findings show you may take part as Geralt of Rivia…
Geralt|What a surprise.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Or as the honorable Ravix of Fourhorn. It's not every year we have a combatant who can boast of two crests! Which do you prefer?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Thanks. Another time, maybe.
Palmerin|Hah! You've denied me some diversion, but at the least my eyes are in for a treat. Lady Vivienne should appear shortly.
Vivienne|Fair knights, I salute you. The honor and duty of tourney patron have fallen to me this year. Fight honorably, so that I may bestow upon one of your number the tourney's grand prize.
Vivienne|You have sworn your vows, you have readied body and soul. The time has come to test them!
Le Papillon|Behold Horm Akerspaark of the Maechtian royal line! His name’s quite the mouthful, a true challenge to rhyme! His targets to be hit centrally and true are the ones in blue.
Le Papillon|Against him, new blood, a knight unknown till now…
Le Papillon|Sir Ravix of Fourhorn! Give us a bow!
Le Papillon|The targets he must with his quarrels thread are red.
Toussaint Knight 03|May the better man win!
Le Papillon|Sir Geralt of Rivia! Give us a bow!
Geralt|Never turn down a round of gwent.
Palmerin|Geralt! Well, I'll be! Have you decided to turn knight errant?
Geralt|All jesting aside, here on a job. You in the tourney, too?
Palmerin|Am I? Hah! I shall square off against Rainfarn of Attre. I saw him just moments ago - a nervous wreck. Stuffing his nose with fisstech, no less - as if that will aid his determination!
Geralt|Guessing that's against the rules.
Palmerin|But who's to tell a Nilfgaardian what to do…? Listen, Geralt, I've a tip for you.
Palmerin|The timing of your marksmanship duel is such that you shall have the sun in your eyes.
Geralt|Makes no difference to me either way.
Palmerin|Nor will it give you any pleasure. Since as it is we must both wait, play me in a round of gwent. Should you win, I shall swap with you. To me, a southerner, the sun is no hindrance.
Palmerin|Ehh, I almost regret beating you. But we've passed the time nicely. Lady Vivienne should appear forthwith. You shall shoot first.
Palmerin|I congratulate you! We shall swap as agreed. We've passed the time rather nicely. Lady Vivienne should appear forthwith. I'm off, to face my first challenge!
Geralt|Good luck.
Le Papillon|Like a lover gauchely grasping but one fair teet, Geralt’s half-strewn 'twixt joyous victory and bitter defeat!
Le Papillon|Ravix jumps ahead, leaves the others behind! Do I see this falsely? Am I out of my mind?
Le Papillon|Geralt jumps ahead, leaves the others behind?! Do I see this falsely? Am I out of my mind?
Le Papillon|Heroic Horm has accurately landed over half his shots! What sharp eyes, strong hands, well-turned calves he's got!
Le Papillon|Brave Sir Ravix has hit over one half of his marks! Will he manage to prevail? Are these glory's first sparks?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Give me a minute. Need to catch my breath.
Geralt|Yeah, let's go now.
Guillaume|In the interim I managed to determine which tent Lady Vivienne occupies.
Guillaume|Perhaps you could find a clue within it.
Geralt|You're right - Vivienne's cursed in some way. Sensed it when she opened the tourney.
Guillaume|In that case, we've no time to lose. Let us go.
Le Papillon|Sir Ravix has won, his bolts struck the goal, yet even this cannot soothe the ache in his soul!
Vivienne|Your prize, sir. A crossbow adorned with your crest. I congratulate you.
Geralt|Thank you, my Lady.
Geralt|My medallion's vibrating, strongly. Can only mean one thing - magic.
Vivienne|The explanation is disappointing, I'm afraid. The fragrance I use, it's mixed by a sorceress.
Toussaint Knight 03|To lose to an opponent such as you is a victory of its own. Accept my congratulations as well.
Geralt|Thanks.
Guillaume|Blast that kind of luck…
Guillaume|Good work!
Geralt|Would you tell me about the other prizes?
Vivienne|Alas, I cannot devote more time to you than to the other combatants. I have duties to attend to. Forgive me.
Guillaume|Are you ready? May we go?
Le Papillon|Horm Akerspaark wins – yet are those tears in his eyes? Perhaps his heart yearns for a lover’s soft sighs.
Le Papillon|Sir Ravix has lost! What a surprise! Could he be cursed? Or… or an imp in disguise?
Le Papillon|Sir Geralt of Rivia did not give his best! He failed, missed his marks and did not pass the test!
Le Papillon|Sir Geralt of Rivia has trounced his foe! Pounded him soundly, immersed him in woe!
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Naezan salts. Hmm… Used to make compresses.
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|Why were you in there?!
Guillaume|Uhh… tourney business. Nothing of import.
Geralt|Clothing's all dark-green and yellow. Seems Yen's not the only one with a fixed color scheme.
Geralt|Oriole feather. Vivienne keep a bird as a pet? No sign of it here, if so.
Geralt|Hmm. Bruxae tend to be fond of birds…
Guillaume|Someone approaches! Quickly!
Geralt|You were supposed to hoot.
Guillaume|We shall speak later. We must return to the tourney, now. It's… it's time for the second contest.
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|Sirs! What seek you in my lady's tent? Inspiration? Begone from here!
Geralt|Jar of concealing ointment. Powerful magic at work here.
Guillaume|This is her tent. You must look inside, search it. I shall hoot like an owl should someone approach.
Guillaume|Oh, fair Vivienne. Thou hast doves' eyes within thy locks.
Guillaume|Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet.
Guillaume|Thy two breasts are like… Hm…
Geralt|Claw marks, that's clear. Not sure what beast left them - just that it's big.
<|endoftext|>
Le Papillon|The tourney's protector! The Maid Vivienne! Her beauty entrances both beasts and men!
Vivienne|My heart's greetings, dear knights! May my grace guide you and show you the path of honor, valor and glory.
Vivienne|Accept my wishes of good fortune, sir… And devote all your strength to the tourney. And only it.
Le Papillon|The time has come for you, Sir Knight. Mount your steed, swift be your flight.
Le Papillon|Ladies and gentlemen of lineage illustrious, soon steeds shall swarm like ants most industrious! To beat time's passage they'll ride like the gale! What a sight to behold, what a lark, what a tale!
Le Papillon|Before us Sir Ravix of Fourhorn dubbed! His spurs flash like lightning, to a shine they've been rubbed!
Le Papillon|Before us Geralt, from Rivia come! Fast as the wind, bright as the sun!
Toussaint Knight 07|Ravix of Fourhorn, is that what you call yourself? You shan't fool me! To this day I bear marks where I met your steel.
Toussaint Knight 07|What, don't you remember? I am Tailles of Dorndal! And I swear to you, before the tourney's end, I shall have added another pock to that collection on your mug!
Geralt|Done? Then step aside. You're in my way.
Toussaint Knight 02|How dare you enter a tourney for nobly born knights?
Toussaint Knight 02|Your knighthood came through the grace of my mother, Meve, Queen of Lyria and Rivia - whom you treacherously deserted mere days later!
Toussaint Knight 02|Your presence here is an offense to my honor!
Geralt|And yours is an offence to my eyes. If you're done, step aside. Prince.
Geralt|Yes, I do. If you please.
Le Papillon|Ere the sands from the glass retire…
Geralt|Any chance you could say it normally?
Le Papillon|None at all. Ahem. Ere the sands from the glass retire, and hearty toil your steed does tire,
Le Papillon|Neath all the gates you must guide your horse, and each of five targets strike with bolts.
Le Papillon|Each dummy felled adds more sand to the glass,
Le Papillon|And each true-shot bolt repeats the task!
Geralt|Yep, all clear now…
Le Papillon|Ravix of Fourhorn!
Le Papillon|For Gregoire of Mount Gorgon, let out a roaring cheer! The famed vower of silence, tourney champion from last year! Today's winner of contests, his victory to secure, shall face Sir Gregoire in a challenge severe!
Le Papillon|Does ignorance demand a bard intercede? Does someone need telling how tourneys proceed?
Le Papillon|Behold, gallant knights and ladies decorous! Gaze at the host assembled before us! Look upon chivalry's best and most storied!
Le Papillon|Come from far lands, here to seek glory! Hear now their names as I shout them aloud, savor their titles, of their presence be proud!
Le Papillon|Palmerin, the baron of Launfal!
Le Papillon|Llinos of Metinna!
Le Papillon|Rainfarn of Attre!
Le Papillon|Horm Akerspaark of Maecht!
Le Papillon|Donimir of Troy!
Le Papillon|Guy de Bois-Fresnes, in service to the duchess!
Le Papillon|Delwyn of Creigiau!
Le Papillon|Count Tailles of Dorndal!
Le Papillon|Anséis, of Lyria and Rivia a prince!
Le Papillon|Geralt of Rivia!
Le Papillon|Aaaaaand… he's off! With a thunderous roar, hooves pound the ground! No legion of drummers could make such a sound!
Le Papillon|So close! Will he last, endure and keep pace? What tension, what stress - what a marvelous race!
<|endoftext|>
Le Papillon|A race of such style, such grace, such speed - to watch was a pleasure, a treat, indeed!
Le Papillon|To honor our entrants, praise each fair knight, we shall feast from eve till dawn's first light! The finest of wine and food shall be served, if you've blood in your veins, come collect what's deserved!
Vivienne|I congratulate you. Here, your prize. A saddle adorned with your crest.
Geralt|Many thanks.
Vivienne|By the way… my maid saw a man with white hair sneak out of my tent. Would you know who it might have been?
Geralt|No idea.
Vivienne|How juvenile.
Guillaume|Come with me to the feast. We shall await Vivienne together, wine in hand.
Geralt|Lead the way.
Guillaume|Congratulations on your win! In stellar style, no less! Ahh, I no longer regret I was not able to participate - almost!
Guillaume|We must drink to this, come with me to the feast. We shall await Vivienne together.
Geralt|Lead the way.
Le Papillon|A failure, a loss, a tragic trip - let us hope with his sword he makes no such slip.
<|endoftext|>
Guillaume|To Vivienne! May you find the means to aid her.
Geralt|To Vivienne.
Guillaume|Ahh… When I first laid eyes on her, I finally understood what all those poems and ballads were trying to say.
Geralt|Love's not poetry alone. Sometimes it's prose. And sometimes it's just plain ugly.
Guillaume|You say that only because you do not know Vivienne as I do. A life with her would be sweetness itself!
Geralt|Actually, you don't know her all that well, either.
Geralt|Dropped something.
Toussaint Knight 07|I demand satisfaction! You've insulted me twicely!
Geralt|And twicely oughta be enough.
Toussaint Knight 07|You refuse to duel?! Then I shall show you how I treat cowards!
Toussaint Knight 02|Your presence at this tourney is an affront to my honor!
Toussaint Knight 02|I demand satisfaction!
Geralt|Head to the nearest brothel, then.
Toussaint Knight 02|Coward! Mounted combat in the main arena - I challenge you!
Geralt|Since you insist, I'm all yours.
Toussaint Knight 02|You shall bitterly regret deserting my mother's army once I'm done with you!
Geralt|Got business to finish here. We'll duel another day.
Guillaume|You cannot refuse another mans' challenge. It is dishonorable - you would be excluded from the tourney! Then what will become of Vivienne?
Toussaint Knight 02|Coward!
Geralt|Fine. Main arena, see you there.
Geralt|Sorry. Don't drink while I work.
Guillaume|We've still some time before Vivienne arrives. Let us drink.
Guillaume|So? Any thoughts on Vivienne?
Geralt|Her beauty's striking.
Guillaume|That is not what I ask.
Geralt|Still too early to say anything I'd be willing to stand behind.
Geralt|Found some clues… Got me wondering if your beloved Vivienne's not a bruxa.
Guillaume|A bruxa?! You mean a… a vampiress?!
Geralt|Not sure yet.
Geralt|Managed to figure one thing out - she uses powerful magic, masking illusions.
Guillaume|Do you mean to say she might in truth look different than she seems?
Geralt|Only guessing right now.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Three nothing, Tailles. Might wanna give some serious thought to whether you want to face me for a fourth.
Toussaint Knight 07|I shall kill you, freak!
Guillaume|You got your chance, sir. You failed to seize it and now you must leave.
Toussaint Knight 07|We shall meet again, mutant!
Toussaint Knight 07|I had been waiting long for that, freak. Now you've gotten what you deserved.
Geralt|Not done yet…
Guillaume|Leave him, Geralt. He's not worth it. And we've come here for an altogether different reason.
Toussaint Knight 07|We shall meet again, mutant.
Toussaint Knight 02|For reasons unknown except to them, the gods have chosen to punish me with defeat. But do not think your cowardice will be forgotten.
Geralt|Dammit, you still going on about that?
Geralt|Need to clear this up once and for all.
Geralt|Had to abandon your mother's camp back then because someone else needed my help, badly. Couldn't refuse them, didn't want to, in fact.
Toussaint Knight 02|Bah. You mean to say, you had a secret mission, set off to accomplish it, having vowed to tell no one of its nature until you did?
Geralt|Something like that. Minus the vow. And uh… I'd still rather not divulge the nature of my… secret mission. Can you accept that as justification?
Toussaint Knight 02|In agreeing to duel, you proved yourself a true knight. Thus I accept your word as that of a man of honor.
Geralt|Glad to hear it. Now I got work to do.
Toussaint Knight 02|The gods have seen fit to punish you for your cowardice.
Geralt|Yadda, yadda - you won, whatever. Now lemme explain something.
Toussaint Knight 02|May the blood I will spill wash away the stain of your cowardice.
Geralt|Let's get this over with. Quick.
Toussaint Knight 02|Three… two… one.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Hear you come to this clearing often.
Vivienne|This is where it all began… And as I was not able to evade you, save myself from you, then I want it done here. In this very spot. With no witnesses.
Geralt|Want what done?
Vivienne|Why, you are a witcher. You were hired to kill me, were you not? Then do so, now. And do it quickly, I beg you. I shan't resist.
Geralt|Witchers only hunt monsters, and even then, not all. You're no monster.
Vivienne|Then what am I to your eyes?
Geralt|Only thing I've figured out so far is you're no danger to anyone. Hope to learn more, though.
Vivienne|If you've no contract on my life, why take an interest at all? Did Guillaume put you up to it? Is that why?
Geralt|He wanted to help you, asked me to do him a favor. Frankly, if I can do something for you, I'll do it, willingly.
Vivienne|Why should I trust you?
Geralt|Cause the duchess trusts me, 'cause I'm a freak, too, 'cause cases like yours are my bread and butter… Take your pick.
Vivienne|You shall not turn on me, use what I say against me? You shall not tell anyone?
Geralt|You got nothing to fear. Came here to help you. And I won't peep a word to anyone, unless I decide it's absolutely necessary.
Vivienne|Ah, so be it. I shall tell you what my mama once told me.
Vivienne|When she was with child, expecting me, she and my father spent much time together near the wood. Here, in this clearing.
Vivienne|Mama loved to listen to the orioles sing. She would stroke her belly and say, "My daughter should be as beautiful as that bird. Such is my wish."
Vivienne|But a creature dwelt in the wood who envied my parents their happiness. One day it appeared before them to say the whole wood belonged to it, and they had dared to delight in something that was not theirs.
Vivienne|It demanded payment, and when my parents said they had nothing, it claimed their unborn daughter as its own.
Geralt|What happened after that?
Vivienne|Nothing, at first. I came into the world a perfectly normal child, and my parents forgot that day's events. But fifteen summers into my life, the curse began to show. Initially, only when the moon was full.
Vivienne|But now it's advanced so that even in daytime I must use magic ointment to mask its symptoms, to look normal. Thus, I thought someone had discovered my secret, then hired you to kill me.
Vivienne|In fact, I was resigned to death in coming here. Perhaps death would be preferable to my complete and permanent transformation. For I fear that is what lies in store.
Geralt|The curse - it could be reversible. Once ran into a baron transformed into a cormorant, ostensibly for good. Managed to cure him completely.
Vivienne|And you truly think you could do something like this for me?
Geralt|Can't guarantee a thing. Tough case, yours. You were cursed before birth - that alone complicates things. Also, you claim the curse is increasing its hold, symptoms are progressing.
Geralt|Could try transferring the curse onto someone else.
Vivienne|What? Out of the question! I shall not allow it to ruin an innocent's life! Is this the only method you know?
Geralt|Only one that’s completely safe.
Vivienne|So there is another?
Geralt|All right. There's another. Ancient ritual, we'd need an oriole egg. Should release the curse's grip permanently. Gotta warn you, though - could have serious consequences.
Vivienne|Consequences? What kind?
Geralt|Curse was cast before you came into this world. Ritual'd involve transferring it to an as yet unhatched chick. You'd be free.
Geralt|Thing is, you could be left with the average life span of an oriole.
Vivienne|Seven years…
Vivienne|I understand. Alas, every rose has its thorn, and there are no happy endings. Yet truth be told, I never thought I would get one. I came here prepared to die.
Vivienne|Yet you wish to give me seven years of life, real life, free life? This is no dilemma. I agree. Wholeheartedly.
Geralt|I see why. I understand. Don't have to decide just yet. Think it through.
Vivienne|I will. They must miss me at the tourney grounds by now. Shall we? Return?
Geralt|Let's. But are you gonna…?
Vivienne|Ahh… yes. I cannot appear there all in feathers. Pardon me for a moment.
Geralt|You can change at will?
Vivienne|No. But I discovered the water of this pool helps. Its effects are brief, but I can always be sure of them.
Geralt|Hmm. Interesting…
Vivienne|Come.
Geralt|Think I'll stay here a little longer.
Vivienne|As you wish. Then I shall see you on the morrow.
Geralt|Pretty quick to reject help. Why is that? The curse once transferred would probably have a weaker hold on the new host, lots weaker.
Vivienne|I do not even wish to hear of it.
Geralt|Ointment you use includes a potent magic ingredient. You don't have the immunity mages have. Use heavy doses, or normal doses too long, and it could be dangerous to you.
Vivienne|I sensed this… The very reason I knew I would have to give it up in the end, and bid my human form a final farewell.
Geralt|Parents ever describe the creature?
Vivienne|They called it a nymph born of the deep woods, with no mother or father. But I was too young, too distraught by the curse's onset, to ask after details.
Geralt|I will be discreet. I swear this on the heron.
Vivienne|You mock me!
Geralt|No. It's just… you want reassurances, too many. If you want my help, you've gotta trust me. Won't peep a word to anyone, unless I decide someone needs to be let in on your secret.
Geralt|Can't promise anything till I hear what you have to say. Decisions based on appearances - not a good idea. Regretted making those too often in the past.
Geralt|Most likely you've been cursed. Don't know who by or why yet, but hope to find that out soon.
Geralt|Why should I guess, when you could tell me yourself.
Geralt|So you're not actually a bruxa.
Vivienne|A what?
Geralt|Suspicion I had - that you might be a vampire. Certain details seemed to confirm it. Then I changed my mind… Anyway, unimportant.
Vivienne|Witcher.
Geralt|Lady Vivienne?
Geralt|Counted on me getting lost.
Vivienne|I did. I thought you no different from the knights. Good at tourneys, hopeless in the face of true danger. I was mistaken.
<|endoftext|>
Guillaume|Did you learn anything?
Geralt|Yeah.
Guillaume|Then speak, man! Can you not see I am out of my mind with worry?! What ails her?!
Geralt|She asked me not to talk about it.
Guillaume|But I want only the best for her! Perhaps I shall be able to help or… I don't know, console her, at the least.
Geralt|We were both right, actually. It is a curse. One that's transforming Vivienne into a bird. Her condition's getting worse.
Guillaume|Gods! A curse that is a worse affliction than disease… What now?! Can you help her?
Geralt|That'll depend on her. I'll try, if she asks me. Significant risks involved, though - shortening her life to about another seven years included.
Guillaume|What?! This is not what we agreed!
Geralt|Tough case. Curse's hold on her grows stronger every day. And I'm a witcher, not a miracle worker.
Geralt|Heard of one other method that could work. Curse could be lifted via her reflection, say, in a pool of water.
Geralt|Thing is, we'd need someone who'd willingly assume the burden of the curse, take it on in her stead.
Guillaume|You mean… become a bird themselves…?
Geralt|Theoretically. See, curse grows weaker once it's transferred. Might end up as just an appetite for seeds and worms. All outcomes are on the table, though. Death included.
Guillaume|I am prepared to sacrifice, give my life for her. Just as King Vridank's knight did for the beautiful Queen Cerro!
Geralt|Knew that already. But are you prepared to swallow bugs for the rest of your life?
Guillaume|… Yes.
Guillaume|Which method do you believe to be best for Vivienne?
Geralt|Don't know yet.
Guillaume|But you've some notion, have you not? Do not tell me you seriously consider drastically shortening her life when I stand prepared to shoulder the burden!
Geralt|Best route? Ritual with the oriole egg. Surest method, won't put any third parties at risk.
Guillaume|Third parties? I am no third party!
Geralt|Hmm… Lemme talk to her. Could very well appreciate your eagerness, change her mind. But it'll have to be her decision.
Guillaume|I'm counting on you, witcher. And I'm content we finally know something. What now? We know all, so you need not see the tourney through. You could withdraw.
Guillaume|True, I shall get an earful from the herald should you fail to show for the last contest… but it's nothing I can't handle. So, what will it be?
Geralt|I don't back out of anything. I'll take part in the last skirmish. Besides, Vivienne'll be busy till the tourney's end.
Guillaume|Indeed. In that case, you must meet the other knights of your team. They await near the arena's entrance, by the training ground.
Geralt|Got it. Thanks.
Geralt|Tourney doesn't interest me anymore. I'll wait in the tent until Vivienne's done with all her duties.
Guillaume|As you will.
Geralt|Method using a pool of water's better. Poses no threat to Vivienne.
Guillaume|Naturally! You must know you can count on me. I shall bear it all. But Vivienne… I fear she might be too proud to agree to such a thing.
Geralt|I'll meet her after the last contest. Talk to her. She could agree.
Geralt|Doesn't matter what we agreed. It's Vivienne's decision. She can either try it or not.
Guillaume|Of course. But I could not live in the knowledge it was I who brought an ill fate down upon her.
Geralt|Vivienne gave me the details of her situation, but she did so in confidence. Promised I wouldn't tell anyone.
Guillaume|But I am not just anyone! Why, I would do anything for her! I was the one to ask you to help her. You cannot shut me out now.
Geralt|I'm sorry. Look, in time, Vivienne'll come to understand what she owes you, I'm sure of it. But until then, you gotta understand the whole world doesn't revolve around you.
Guillaume|How dare you lecture me! This is not the aid I sought! And to think I gave up my spot in the tourney to you! I regret it, now. Do you even intend to compete to the end?
Guillaume|Or now that you've bound Vivienne to your terms, you no longer see the need?
Geralt|Woman riding a bear, yellow field.
Geralt|Need to find my tent. Should look around for the one with my crest.
Geralt|Blue bridge on a black field, three red diamonds on a white one.

Toussaint Knight 01|It is time, gentlemen. Take your weapons and proceed to the arena.
Le Papillon|A cheer for the knights, the ladies, the lords! For our next entertainment, the teams shall cross swords!
Le Papillon|Two rival crews, two coteries, shall fight, full tilt, till one's dropped to its knees.
Le Papillon|Who virtue ignores or lands blows unclean, shall forever be branded as shameful, obscene.
Le Papillon|While the knights prepare, let me say I'm elated, to behold such a crowd, on edge, breath bated!
Le Papillon|Whoever here wins the past champion shall face - all others must leave, heads bowed in disgrace.
Toussaint Knight 02|If you swing your blade as deftly as you shoot, we shall win. Good luck.
Toussaint Knight 02|I know now the two teams' rosters. I shall be captain of ours. That means you shall do as I say for the duration of the fight. Is this clear?
Toussaint Knight 02|Palmerin de Launfal will lead the opposing team.
Toussaint Knight 02|With this skirmish we commemorate the Battle of Fox Hollow of 1218, when a hanse of southern outlaws led by Hallar the Brown attacked Toussaint only to be driven off by brave knights, thus setting a precedent.
Toussaint Knight 02|Since that day knights errant have guarded the duchy's borders. Palmerin drew the short straw, so his team shall play the barbarian Hallar's men. Any questions?
Geralt|None.
Toussaint Knight 02|I doubt you will do us any good. You know nothing of knightly combat as a witcher. Try at least to stay out of our way.
Le Papillon|Let us begin! Crowd, raise a ruckus! Blood, sweat and tears shall soon follow in buckets!
Le Papillon|Alone Geralt stands, alone he fights on - but inside does he weep for those who have gone?
Le Papillon|Now there's but Ravix, though he's far from done. When all the dust clears, shall he have won?
Le Papillon|Oh me, oh my, that must have been painful! Like a thorn to the heart, only more baneful!
<|endoftext|>
Le Papillon|The world's never seen a fight quite so glorious! For showing such verve, each knight was victorious!
Le Papillon|Yet at tourney's end, but one champion may reign. Today it is Palmerin! All praise to his name!
Le Papillon|Like lions, like leopards - so fierce fought his host! To them give your cheers, love, esteem utmost!
Le Papillon|Palmerin de Launfal and Gregoire de Gorgon, two knights of high valor shall fight to be champion!
Le Papillon|Noble Sir Ravix shall not stand in La Belle. Though hopes he raised high, of victory short he fell!
Le Papillon|To the tired remainder, we salute your endeavors! Return to your wives, your loves, your whomevers!
Le Papillon|Geralt of Rivia shall not stand in La Belle. Though hopes he raised high, of victory short he fell!
Le Papillon|To Ravix of Fourhorn, who the strength of lions boasts!
Le Papillon|He sailed through all trials, each test he passed with ease, but now awaits the last - will it bring him to his knees?
Le Papillon|For Gregoire de Gorgon, who on this ground last won, shall spar him for the title, ere the day is done.
Le Papillon|To Geralt of Rivia, who the strength of lions boasts!
Le Papillon|Yet in tourneys as in life, but one champion may reign. Today he is the one! Praised be his name! He felled a whole host, slew the most--
<|endoftext|>
Le Papillon|The brave knight Ravix hails from Fourhorn! It might sound fictitious, yet there he was born!
Le Papillon|Now entering the grounds, a titan of infamy! Gregoire de Gorgon, victor of last year's tourney!
Vivienne|I wish both combatants good fortune and fame.
Le Papillon|It is time. Step into the arena. Should you suffer grievous harm during combat, have you any last wishes, any missives you wish passed to your loved ones?
Geralt|Thanks, I'm fine.
Le Papillon|The witcher of Rivia! Geralt his name! Though aged be his visage, do not disdain! His locks, true, are white, but he was born to fight!
Le Papillon|Geralt of Rivia! This year's champion! A sight to behold! He defeated Gregoire de Gorgon!
Le Papillon|Hail Geralt! Eralt! Eralt! Eralt!
Le Papillon|Ravix of Fourhorn! This year's champion! A sight to behold! He defeated Gregoire de Gorgon!
Le Papillon|Hail Ravix! Avix! Avix! Avix!
Vivienne|As patron of this grand tourney, I've the honor to decorate our grand champion.
Vivienne|He made no vow yet throughout the tourney demonstrated knightly virtue that doubtless carried him to this splendid victory.
Vivienne|He showed great courage, great strength, great composure. He fought nobly, with honor, and thus rightfully deserves the title of this year's champion of the arena!
Geralt|I need to talk to you.
Vivienne|Not now! We shall meet later in my tent. I've duties to attend to. As do you. Folk regard you! The least you should do is wave.
Vivienne|His vow he made upon the heron. Doubtless the gravity of his knightly pledge upon the noble fowl carried him to this splendid victory.
Vivienne|His vow he made upon the garter of Her Illustrious Highness Anna Henrietta. Doubtless the duchess' grace carried him to this splendid victory.
Vivienne|His vow he made upon his love for his heart's captor. And it was doubtless this vow that carried him to this splendid victory.
Le Papillon|Pacing the grounds the titans locked stares, ferocious and spry as wolves hunting hares.
Le Papillon|Mesdames et messieurs! Our victor, our champion! The unequaled and silent Gregoire de Gorgon! Hip, hip, hurray! Urray! Urray! Urray!
Le Papillon|The crowd cries in shock! Sir Ravix seems weak! Will he survive? His fortunes look bleak!
Le Papillon|The crowd cries in shock! Sir Geralt seems weak! Will he survive? His fortunes look bleak!
Le Papillon|The grim giant Gregoire - never defeated. Yet what see we now? Could his strength be depleted?
Le Papillon|Shall we see upon this day, a giant not of iron but of clay?
Le Papillon|I should take this opportunity to remind all that today's tourney is brought to you by the Vermentino and Coronata vineyards! Remember, whether it's dessert or dinner, serve Vermentino and you're a winner.
Le Papillon|And now a few words from our sponsor - the Tufo vineyard! For strong bones and teeth, drink Tufo! A wine for your table, a wine for your soul!
<|endoftext|>
Vivienne|Are you ready, witcher?
Geralt|Need to find an egg, preferably an oriole's. Ritual itself isn't complicated, but like I said before, there'll be a side effect. Still sure you want to go through with it?
Vivienne|Yes. I saw a nest in the clearing where we spoke. But before we go, tell me… what will become of the chick?
Geralt|We'll have to break the egg.
Geralt|Like you said, not everyone gets a happy ending.
Vivienne|And for a dream to come true there must be sacrifices. Very well. Let us go.
Geralt|Not ready to do that yet.
Vivienne|I understand lifting a curse is no simple affair, even for a witcher. But I've made my decision and fear none of the risks. Return to me when you are ready.
Geralt|Everything's agreed, so no point wasting any more time. Let's go.
Geralt|Need to take care of something first.
Vivienne|I understand.
Guillaume|Come back quickly.
Guillaume|My Lady, I live to serve you. Whatsoever you require, you need but beckon. I am yours to command!
Vivienne|Are you quite finished? Is that all you wish to say?
Guillaume|I… I-I suppose so.
Vivienne|So, you shall do what I command, sir?
Vivienne|Very well, then. Listen carefully. Leave this tent. Turn towards the duchy's northern marches. And run. Run until the tourney grounds are no longer within sight.
Vivienne|Return only once you've cooled off. Then leave me be forever more. Understood?
Guillaume|My Lady… but… your troubles… I only wished … The witcher, see…
Vivienne|Out! Now!
Vivienne|You assured me I could trust you.
Geralt|Absolutely sure you did the right thing? Not too hasty, rejecting his help?
Geralt|Can't conduct the ritual using your reflection without him. Needed someone who'd willingly assume the curse in your stead.
Vivienne|And you thought I would agree to this? No, Geralt. When we spoke in the meadow, you told me of a ritual which required no lusty knights to aid us.
Vivienne|This is the method I wish to pursue.
Geralt|I kept your secret. Didn't tell him anything he didn't already know.
Vivienne|I understand he hired you, so you had to report to him. But this is not his affair, Geralt. This is my life.
Geralt|Sure. Wanna tell you something, though. Think we should try the alternate method first.
Vivienne|I was clear. It is out of the question!
Geralt|Let me finish. Second method's less than reliable. To put it simply, might work, might not.
Guillaume|But it will! I shall save you, oh lovely Vivienne!
Vivienne|Why are you here, sir?! This is a private conversation!
Geralt|He's not your foe. Got good intentions. You guessed right, he hired me, but only because he wanted to help you.
Guillaume|Be not angry, my Lady. You no longer bear this burden alone - I know all.
Vivienne|You told him?!
Guillaume|I know a curse afflicts you. A curse which grows more severe by the day. I understand how you feel. My aunt, Countess de Launfal, once contracted a strange illness which ate away at her from the inside.
Guillaume|She grew weaker by the day, the light fading from her eyes. I remember her saying the worst was not the pain, but losing mastery of her own body. She was so helpless…
Guillaume|I fear you feel the same. The witcher knows a way to lift the curse from you and let it rest on me. I wish to do this, to take it from you, Vivienne.
Vivienne|Why?
Guillaume|Because I love you.
Guillaume|I might have died in the arena. I sought to slay a shaelmaar, for you… but now I see the fool I was, now I see how I risked my life for no purpose. Yet with this, I can truly do something for you.
Vivienne|I do not wish to inflict this horror on anyone. You saw how it looks.
Vivienne|Witcher… I turn to you as one elder and, hopefully, one wiser as well. Do you think this a good idea?
Geralt|Worth a try, as I see it. Original curse fell on an unborn child. Doubt it'll take hold as strongly when transferred to a full grown man.
Guillaume|You've now heard the expert opinion. Let us do this together, Vivienne.
Vivienne|Very well… I was prepared to die. Thus I am also prepared to attempt something mad. Now we must go to my pool in the woods, yes?
Geralt|Honestly, don't know. Already told you both, I can't predict the ritual's side effects. Guillaume's right about one thing, though.
Geralt|He's risked his life in completely pointless ways. Till now.
Geralt|No need to be sharp with him, my Lady. And If I'm to help you, gotta do one thing for me - hear what Guillaume has to say.
Vivienne|Is that an ultimatum?
Geralt|Looks to be.
Geralt|Sure, but… seems your tent's grown ears.
Geralt|Show yourself, Guillaume. Can hear you breathing. And I know damn well it's you.
Vivienne|Why are you here, sir?! This is a private audience. Geralt, what is the meaning of this? Is this some scheme you've hatched unbeknownst to me?
Geralt|No, no scheming involved. Guillaume hired me. But this matter relates to you, not him. Didn't invite him here, in any case.
Geralt|Actually, surprised he showed up.
Geralt|Guillaume's no foe. Though there's little honor in meddling, he meant well, means well.
Geralt|You guessed correctly - he was the one to hire me. But only because he wanted to help you.
Geralt|Greetings, my Lady. Have you decided?
Vivienne|I have. I stand by all I said. I wish to endanger no one and thus choose the method involving an egg. If it's to be the egg of an oriole, I know where to find one. There is a nest in my clearing.
Vivienne|Might you explain the nature of the ritual, its exact course?
<|endoftext|>
Vivienne|So… this is my true form. It is not too late, you may still change your mind. It would bring no shame.
Guillaume|My mind is made up, my resolve is firm. If you can handle it, so will I. You are beautiful to me, even as you stand now.
Vivienne|Oh, that's clearly rubbish.
Geralt|Shut your eyes, both of you, and don't move.
Vivienne|Guillaume…?
Guillaume|Yes, my love?
Vivienne|If you become as I am now, I wish you to know - I shall not leave you.
Geralt|Picture yourselves reflected in a pool of water. Focus on that…
Geralt|Now… open your eyes.
Geralt|Damn… Think it might've worked.
Geralt|How do you feel? In general. You feel a change, Guillaume?
Guillaume|I was struck, hard, as if by a battering ram. But now, I feel not at all different… apart from a slight itch on my skin. Are you certain it worked?
Geralt|Yes. Something happened, definitely. Must be an intersection beneath this pond. Powerful magic at work here - look at Vivienne.
Guillaume|What now?
Geralt|Now? Now you get to live together, happily ever after.
Geralt|Still, watch yourselves carefully. Notice any troubling symptoms, find me.
Guillaume|Naturally. I thank you, Geralt. Oh, and your payment.
Vivienne|Ahh… At last! I've so much to make up for! Balls to attend! Distant lands to see!
Guillaume|Free at last… as a bird.
Vivienne|Hah! I find you droll. I had not noticed before.
Guillaume|But you will not fly away without me?
Vivienne|That remains to be seen, I think… But I, too, must thank you, witcher.
Geralt|Don't mention it. You take care, both.
Geralt|Up to you, now. Here's hoping you'll solve your own problems, and never run into any that require a witcher.
Geralt|Honestly didn't think this'd work. Doubted anything would happen. Read about this ritual in grimoires, descriptions all seemed dramatic, embellished, all stipulated a condition that seemed improbable…
Guillaume|What condition was this?
Geralt|A real bond between those involved, true love.
Vivienne|The aunt you mentioned… what became of her?
Guillaume|She passed on.
Guillaume|Die, beast!
Guillaume|My Lady… Might I be allowed…? I've written… verses… with you in mind… for you… I would like to recite them. If it be your will.
Vivienne|It is.
Guillaume|Ahem… Your locks like waves of wheat stalks crowned gold by the sun!
Guillaume|Your midriff soft as down, your voice a nightingale's trill! Errrr, no, I mean… the simile… not the best… Do forgive me.
Vivienne|I mean no offense, but… I'd rather you spoke normally. Poetry puts me to sleep, I fear. Scholarly treatises - somehow I've always preferred those.
<|endoftext|>
Vivienne|This is the place.
Vivienne|Oh no! A panther's gotten at the nest!
Geralt|Stand back. I'll take care of this.
Geralt|Eggs fell on a moss patch. They're fine except for one - it's cracked.
Vivienne|Will it do?
Geralt|Think so.
Vivienne|Now, what must I do?
Geralt|You need to concentrate, now. Repeat after me - Munna gan dehrau, munna finerat.
Vivienne|Munna gan dehrau, munna finerat.
Vivienne|Munna gan dehrau, munna finerat.
Vivienne|Munna gan dehrau, munna finerat.
Geralt|Dammit…
Vivienne|Geralt! Look! Look!
Vivienne|Ah, gods! I shall be able to attend balls! I shall travel to Oxenfurt, to Novigrad, even! Thank you, witcher!
Geralt|Oughta thank Guillaume. He's the one hired me… to help you.
Vivienne|Yes… I am grateful to him as well, immensely. Will you tell him so for me?
Geralt|Sure. I'll tell him. Farewell, Vivienne.
Geralt|Should tell him yourself, don't you think?
Vivienne|Perhaps I should. But I would prefer not to. Convey my gratitude to him in my stead, please? Be so kind?
Geralt|Just to be sure, gonna ask one last time - positive you want to do this. If we succeed, the changes'll be irreversible. You'll probably also only have seven years left to live. At the most.
Vivienne|Seven years free of the fear that someone might spy me at the wrong moment? Of the stigma of being a freak? A monster?
Vivienne|Seven years of a life both true and unfettered. Yes, Geralt. I'm certain I wish to do it.
Geralt|All right.
<|endoftext|>
Vivienne|Greetings, witcher.
Geralt|You're well? Everything seem in order?
Guillaume|We are. And it is. I thank you again, Geralt.
Geralt|Well… take care, you two… love birds.
Geralt|Noticed any changes? Anything strange on your body? Troubling symptoms?
Guillaume|Ah… Hm, how shall I put this? Ahem… I've grown some feathers… well, down, to be precise.
Geralt|Whereabouts?
Guillaume|Ahhh…. Why mention it. It's such a minor a problem.
Vivienne|Personally, I like it.
Vivienne|I'm not at all fond of that chain you wear. It clashes horribly with my dress.
Guillaume|But it's my dynastic crest…
Vivienne|I don't like it.
Guillaume|Very well, darling. I shall put it away.
Guillaume|My mother's invited us to afternoon tea tomorrow. She would like very much to meet you.
Vivienne|But I told you, my dear. We're expected tomorrow at a Mandragora soirée.
Vivienne|For a boy, I'm most fond of Vivaldi. And our daughter we shall name Marilla.
Guillaume|Yes, my beloved, yes.
<|endoftext|>
Guillaume|Geralt! What of Vivienne?
Geralt|Managed to lift her curse.
Guillaume|Truly? So all will be well, her troubles are done?
Geralt|Vivienne chose what suited her best. She's completely free now. And happy… I think.
Guillaume|Without me…
Geralt|You helped her. But that doesn't mean she owes you her love.
Geralt|Got this bard friend, philosopher, too, I guess, amateur. He'd say, if you love somebody, set them free.
Guillaume|Do you know what, Geralt? You earned your reward, so take it. But keep your advice to yourself. Adieu.
Geralt|Method she chose worked. Thing is, she might only live for a few years more. Seven or so, most likely. Though I could be wrong.
Guillaume|You had better be! You failed me, witcher. I placed my trust in you, and--
Geralt|It was Vivienne's decision. Wanted to do it her way. Can't blame me for that.
Geralt|Asked me to give you a message - said she's grateful. Thanks to you, she can live a normal life.
Guillaume|Good, good… but how does she fare?
Geralt|Guillaume. What--? What're you doing here?
Guillaume|Leave me be… Without my Vivienne, life has no meaning. You are the last to whom I wish to speak.
Geralt|What's brought you to Novigrad?
Vivienne|I've toured the entire city, already. Now I seek a ship to take me to the Skellige Isles.
Vivienne|I've heard there are beautiful flying sirens there. And mountains that rise out of the sea into the sky. Is any of it true?
Geralt|It all is, actually. Except you'll want to watch out for the sirens. As beautiful as they are dangerous.
Vivienne|I shall be careful, I promise. Farewell, Geralt. Ah! One last thing. I would like you to have this. I kept it at first… as a memento. But I think I'd prefer not to have anything to remind me of that time. Will you take it?
Geralt|Course. Thank you. And take care.
Geralt|How do you feel? No relapse?
Vivienne|None. I feel wonderful. You've no idea how relieved I am. I went to see a mummers play in Pont Vanis. Out of doors, and it went on late into the night.
Vivienne|And I did not need to flee at dusk. I also attended Baroness de Cordelle's ball, danced till the break of dawn!
Geralt|Vivienne. Hey.
Vivienne|Witcher! So good to see you.

Toussaint Inkeeper Man 01|Fried endrega glands! Dog's nipples! Get them while their hot! Spiraled pig's ears! Wren's tongues! On sale now! Come and get them!
Toussaint Knight 02|Good man, I need a fresh set of shoes for my mount. Promptly!
Toussaint Blacksmith 02|At your service, sir. The racing model is one I recommend - light, durable and a mere fifty crowns apiece.
Toussaint Knight 02|I shall pay you double provided they are ready today.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|The archery - that's what I like. Maybe this year they'll pop off another onlooker?
Toussaint Noble Woman 01|Ahh, the flower of chivalry… Strapping lads!
Beauclair Drunk Man 02|That gray-domed scoundrel - ever seeking Lady Vivienne. Some kind of maniac.
Toussaint Boy 02|Hey! He fought in the tourney! He looked taller in the arena…
Toussaint Girl 02|I was there. Papa took me. I saw him fight the other knights! What a sight, what a bumbotching! Ooh!
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Brave knights - what are they good for? They nail no barrels together, they sew no stockings… Parasites, leeches, that's what they are.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Long live the champion!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|I could use one like you! To bring water from the well, to show off about town…
Toussaint Knight 06|Troooy! Redaniaaa!
Toussaint Knight 08|Yap less, fight more, bumbotcher.
Toussaint Inkeeper Man 01|Fried toad's eggs! Dragon's eyes on a stick! Come and get it! Fresh and wholesome!
Toussaint Chorus|Geeralt! Geeralt! Geeralt!
Toussaint Chorus|Raavix! Raavix! Raavix!
Geralt|A knight's body… Guillaume. Poor fool.
Geralt|Lost blood, lots of it. Wrung dry, you might say. Numerous wounds… must've fought a tough battle before he died.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Mean me?
Kovir Nobleman|Who else?! You are the White Wolf, are you not? You saw my notice, I presume?
Kovir Nobleman|Forgive me. I should introduce myself. Count Beledal, a great admirer of your deeds.
Geralt|Thanks. Not something we witchers hear often.
Kovir Guard 01|But Count, sir, d'you mean to go off with just this witcher? A right hardy fellow he is, no ponce, I'm sure, but your expedition's too risky on the whole. And not takin' us with you's, pardon my sayin' it, right daft.
Kovir Nobleman|You exaggerate, Vilmar. I believe I can manage to survive half a day without someone there to wipe my arse in my stead.
Kovir Nobleman|My guards lament, witcher, but you must forgive them. Now, to get down to brass tacks.
Kovir Nobleman|I've a rather extraordinary proposition for you.
Kovir Nobleman|I'm a lover, witcher, of nature, haha! A devotee of the wild, and Toussaint is home to several species not encountered elsewhere.
Kovir Nobleman|I'd like you to accompany me on an expedition whose aim is to… hmm, preserve them.
Kovir Guard 01|Ahem.
Kovir Nobleman|Ah, yes. Naturally, you'll protect me should the need arise. My ever vigilant guards, see, will report any reckless behavior to my wife if I get so much as a scratch. And then woe will be me.
Geralt|Need some details before I can say anything. Where're we going, what'm I supposed to do, exactly…?
Kovir Nobleman|In the roundest terms, we shall admire the local flora and fauna. And while we do, I might preserve a thing or two.
Geralt|Preserve?
Kovir Nobleman|I've this device, see - a parestisomach. It, uh, it captures, uh, likenesses.
Geralt|A parisestawhat?
Kovir Nobleman|It's like a moveable megascope, capturing moments, transforming them into illusions, based upon which I then paint a painting.
Geralt|So… you want me with you, looking at animals and flowers and…
Kovir Nobleman|That's more or less what it amounts to, yes. Except, you will first have to track down the creatures I wish to capture. I know only the very approximate locations of their habitats.
Kovir Nobleman|Well, and should any trouble arise, we'll have your sword at the ready, right? So, agreed?
Geralt|Doesn't seem hard… Be glad to do something pleasant for a change.
Kovir Nobleman|Sublime. In that case, here's your map.
Kovir Nobleman|Before coming here, I dispatched requests to several local hunters. They located the habitats of the species of interest to me and marked out their ranges on the map.
Geralt|Good thinking. It'll save us some time, won't need to track. Ready to go?
Kovir Nobleman|I'm afraid we've to await the morn. Proper light, see, it's very important.
Kovir Nobleman|In the meantime, be my guest at my fire, sir. In fact, I'd be delighted to hear some tales of witcher life…
Kovir Nobleman|Well, the wide and wild world beckons. The light now is perfect.
Kovir Nobleman|Yes, let's. The light seems perfect just now.
Geralt|All in all… why not. You convinced me, let's say.
Geralt|Pretty unusual contract…
Kovir Nobleman|I couldn't agree more, yes. And I'm prepared to pay a commensurately high fee.
Geralt|Don't mind if we actually talk about exactly how high that'll be first, do you?
Kovir Nobleman|Why ever would I? Please, simply tell me how much you wish to receive.
Geralt|Not sure you actually get what it is I do. I'm a professional monster slayer.
Geralt|Not some guide for nature walks.
Kovir Nobleman|Forgive me, master, I meant no offense.
Geralt|None taken. Just, next time you post a notice for a witcher, at least make sure it's witcher work you've got in mind.
Kovir Nobleman|Naturally. Yet should you have a change of heart, whatever the reason, I shall wait here a while longer.
Geralt|Count Beledal? Famous poultry farmer - is that it?
Kovir Nobleman|Ahem, heheh, that was my grandpapa. Dear man. But my trade is the wine trade - I import the finest vintages to Kovir, my homeland.
Kovir Nobleman|The very reason for my frequent visits to Beauclair, during which I like to, hmm, partake of nature, let us say.
Geralt|Really need a witcher to, uh, partake? Got guards of your own. Take them, save some coin.
Kovir Nobleman|I could, surely, but they too deserve a bit of rest, relaxation - right, lads? Besides, I've plenty of coin, coin that needs spending. Who dares stop me?
Geralt|Ah. So this is about a rich man, bored stiff, seeking thrills.
Kovir Guard 01|There's also Clarissa, who--
Kovir Nobleman|Vilmar, please…
Geralt|Who what?
Kovir Nobleman|Ehh… my daughter. I always return from my travels with some souvenir or another. She looks forward to them tremendously.
Kovir Nobleman|But we did not meet to chat about my family. We must discuss our venture, must we not?
Kovir Nobleman|As you've no doubt gleaned from the notice, I've a rather extraordinary proposition for you.
Geralt|Greetings.
Kovir Nobleman|Greetings to you, White Wolf! I presume you saw my notice? Ah, a foolish question - you are here, thus you must have seen it!
Kovir Nobleman|Sorry, but that's too much. Even for one like me.
Kovir Nobleman|Hm. I'm close to agreeing, very, very close… Could you drop it just a bit lower?
Kovir Nobleman|Sublime! We've a deal!
Kovir Nobleman|No! Now that's going too far. I believe I was mistaken about you, witcher.
Kovir Nobleman|Either take what I offer, or we can forget the whole thing.
Kovir Nobleman|White Wolf! You're back after all! A change of heart, is it?
Geralt|Still thinking about it.
Kovir Nobleman|You don't deem this witcher work, I know, yet I assure you it shall leave no stain on your honor.
Kovir Nobleman|Apart from which, it's a chance at easy coin. Perhaps also a pleasant diversion.
Kovir Nobleman|So, how do you see it? Are you in?
Kovir Nobleman|Lads, I find your concern touching, I do. Yet I've long awaited this day. So you must forgive me, but I shall go through with it as planned.
Kovir Nobleman|Ah! It seems my guide has arrived!
Kovir Nobleman|You make mountains of molehills, Vilmar. I shall be better than fine.
Kovir Guard 01|I must insist, Count. You'll be much, much the safer with us at your side.
Kovir Nobleman|Balderdash!
Kovir Guard 02|Count, if I may. I believe Vilmar's in the right. There's no knowin' what lurks in these wilds.
Kovir Nobleman|Oh, you've returned. Splendid! We shall await dawn's superior light and venture out then.
Geralt|Seems I got the map, so I'll lead.
<|endoftext|>
Kovir Nobleman|Aaargh! Geralt, save me!
Geralt|Seems like a safe spot.
Kovir Nobleman|Safe, perhaps. But it offers no view whatsoever.
Geralt|Hm. Fine, we'll keep looking.
Geralt|Here, maybe? Distance seems right, light's not bad either.
Kovir Nobleman|Yes, this will work perfectly!
Kovir Nobleman|Can you lure them out?
Geralt|Gimme a minute, need to think… Vibrations - gotta send some through the ground.
Geralt|I'll try tossing a bomb or casting a Sign. And you watch out, don't get any closer.
Kovir Nobleman|Wait, we were to find a safe place for me first.
Kovir Nobleman|Blast it, I see you're simply unreliable.
Geralt|Got pretty broad interests for a "man of the city."
Kovir Nobleman|I suppose I dabble in my share of things - wine, nature, painting…
Kovir Nobleman|I imagine the life of a witcher must be rather more monotonous… with all due respect.
Geralt|It is. Never boring, though.
Kovir Nobleman|I for one cannot fathom only ever consorting with the same creatures, day in and day out.
Geralt|Got a wife?
Kovir Nobleman|Yes. What's that got to do with anything?
Geralt|Nothing, just asking.
Kovir Nobleman|Oh, this will be a masterpiece! Smile, please!
Kovir Nobleman|Do not look in my direction!
Kovir Nobleman|You don't truly intend to leave me on my own?
Geralt|I'm back. Let's go.
Kovir Nobleman|Oh, thank the gods. I'd begun to think you'd abandoned me.
Kovir Nobleman|No, no, no, not like that! What have you done?!
Kovir Nobleman|Just a few more captures! Keep them above ground!
Kovir Nobleman|Oh my, I failed to warn you! Apologies!
Kovir Nobleman|The parestisomach has an added lantern! You must look away, or it will blind you!
Kovir Nobleman|I wish to admire the wildlife, preserve it. Not watch them kill it in a fit of misguided fear for my life.
Geralt|What if the wildlife attacks us?
Kovir Nobleman|Then we shall have no other recourse. I do not wish to be something's supper. Do you?
Kovir Nobleman|But as long as they remain calm, we've no need to provoke them. It's of the utmost importance to me, in fact.
Geralt|Map says there should be panthers around here.
Geralt|Stay close. Keep your eyes peeled.
Kovir Nobleman|I've but one request, witcher. Avoid bloodshed if at all possible.
Geralt|Hear that? Panthers.
Kovir Nobleman|Frankly, I did not hear a thing. Clearly, your senses are far more acute than mine. I must rely on them.
Kovir Nobleman|I cannot abide poaching. I'm content you share my love for animals.
Kovir Nobleman|You need not have killed her. She had young…
Geralt|Didn't intend to, believe me. Was worried about your safety. It's why you hired me, isn't it?
Kovir Nobleman|Ehh, I suppose you're right. Let's move on. But this time be more cautious, please.
Geralt|We're here.
Kovir Nobleman|Well, this vantage point's no good. I shan't capture a good image from here.
Geralt|All right, wait. We'll find you a better spot that's safe, too.
Geralt|Tread lightly. Giant centipedes sense the softest sounds, the lightest vibrations. You wake one up, it wakes up angry.
Geralt|How about here?
Kovir Nobleman|I don't know… Isn't it a bit close?
Geralt|Right. We'll find another spot.
Kovir Nobleman|I thank you. Truly magnificent that was.
Kovir Nobleman|We can move on now.
Kovir Nobleman|You were to find a place where I would have a good view. Instead, you ran into their lair.
Geralt|Sorry. Got carried away.
Kovir Nobleman|Lovely. I've exactly what I wanted.
Kovir Nobleman|Come, we've disturbed them enough…
Geralt|I was wondering… why peacocks?
Kovir Nobleman|My… my daughter is rather fond of them. They will be a treat for her.
Geralt|We're close. Eyes in the back of your head.
Geralt|A feather from the rump, coated in suet. Cock shed it recently and the suet's got a distinct scent. Oughta be able to track the flock.
Kovir Nobleman|A witcher in action, what a treat to watch…
Geralt|Sh, hear that? They're calling to each other.
Kovir Nobleman|Fabulous, we're getting close.
Kovir Nobleman|Ready! Use your magic, witcher!
Kovir Nobleman|Ohh, that's lovely! Now if they could just splay their tails…
Geralt|See what I can do.
Geralt|Find a good spot.
Kovir Nobleman|No! What are you doing?!
Kovir Nobleman|Do not kill them!
Kovir Nobleman|Splendid work, thank you.
Kovir Nobleman|So much blood, this is tragic… I made a terrible mistake taking a witcher along.
Geralt|Sh. Heard something. Grunting, panting… something like a bear's.
Kovir Nobleman|Ooh, I'm not the least bit eager to come face to mug with a bear. We should move on..
Geralt|Hear that? Deer, I think…
Kovir Nobleman|Incredible. Sharp as a razor, your hearing…
Geralt|Parestisomach's upset the animals. Better get out of here.
Geralt|Wouldn't rather be out here with those guards of yours?
Kovir Nobleman|Haha. You jest! It's deliverance to emerge from under their wings. Believe me. They're overprotective, oppressively so.
Geralt|Giant centipedes! Dammit!
Kovir Nobleman|Where did they come from?!
Geralt|Must've followed us! Get back!
Geralt|Watch out! Giant centipedes!
Kovir Nobleman|But you killed them already!
Geralt|Clearly not all! Get back!
Geralt|See that? Soil's been turned over recently. Smells of fresh peat, too…
Kovir Nobleman|Hm. And what does that mean?
Geralt|Giant centipede nests, close by.
Geralt|Step softly or they'll detect the vibrations. And we don't want them coming too close.
Geralt|Shh. Hear 'em?
Kovir Nobleman|It's those, uhh…
Geralt|Centipedes, giant. Underground, tunnel burrowers. Make a distinct sound.
Geralt|We can use that to track them.
Geralt|Sound's loud and clear here. Must be near the nest.
Geralt|Damn poachers. Snares - looks like they were hoping for a bear. Panther got caught instead.
Kovir Nobleman|Look, a cub. Will you help the mother?
Geralt|Give it a shot. Gotta calm her first. Likely to lunge at us otherwise.
Kovir Nobleman|Brilliant. You freeing her - a superb image.
Kovir Nobleman|Exhilarating! Positively exhilarating! Thank you! I've one more request - local peacocks performing their mating ritual. I'd love to see that. Apparently, a flock dwells not far from here.
Geralt|We can go, just don't count on peeping at them while they mate. Season ended a month back.
Kovir Nobleman|Oh, that's terrible. I so wished to capture their splendorous tails in full bloom. Is there nothing you can do if they prove uneager to present? Perhaps challenge them somehow, goad them?
Geralt|What'd you have in mind? Don't have a tail myself. And I'm not likely to sprout one anytime soon.
Kovir Nobleman|My thoughts were more along the lines of witcher magic. They say you can exert influence over lesser creatures.
Geralt|Ehh, yeah. Guess I can try. Can't promise you anything, though..
Kovir Nobleman|Splendid, consider me contented. I cannot pinpoint the flock's location, but a hunter I know told me of a few likely spots. I'll mark them for you.
Geralt|All right. Let's go find some peacocks.
Geralt|All over now…
Kovir Nobleman|Phew, that was… that was… tense. I believe I've had my fill of excitement for today.
Kovir Nobleman|An excellent day for capturing moments!
Kovir Nobleman|And folk call witchers heartless… This will put the lie to that!
<|endoftext|>
Kovir Nobleman|What a wonderful adventure!
Geralt|Get everything you wanted?
Kovir Nobleman|Yes.
Geralt|In that case, time to get back to your camp.
Geralt|Returning your lord to you - safe and sound.
Kovir Guard 01|You've our gratitude, master.
Kovir Nobleman|You see, lads? There was nothing to fear.
Kovir Guard 01|Thank you, witcher, for lookin' after our dear count. Seems the jaunt did 'im wonders, breathed some new life into 'im.
Kovir Nobleman|Wait here a moment, Geralt. I've to fetch my coin pouch, pay my dues.
Geralt|No need to thank me. Gladly have more contracts like this.
Kovir Guard 01|Count's a wonder, ain't he. It's a sad injustice the misfortune that's touched the family.
Geralt|Misfortune?
Kovir Guard 01|Made no mention, did he?
Kovir Guard 01|Ten years back his lass, Clarissa's her name, took a spill off her horse. Been bedridden ever since, cannot walk of her own.
Kovir Guard 01|She'd been the life of the house before the calamity, a merry sprite what filled every corner with joy. Count would oft take her out on trips - she loved animals, too.
Kovir Guard 01|Excursions he makes now, or rather the paintin's he brings home - they's her only window on the wider world.
Kovir Nobleman|Sorry to make you wait.
Kovir Nobleman|I thank you for your efforts yet must admit I expected just a bit more from the famed White Wolf…
Kovir Nobleman|There you are, the agreed sum. Now do forgive us, there are things we must tend to.
Kovir Nobleman|Your reward. Use it well.
Geralt|Thanks.
Kovir Nobleman|Some of your shenanigans proved a little unnerving, yet I still consider the day a success.
Kovir Nobleman|Seems even witchers have a sense of humor, stand to do something deranged at times, heheh. Good to know.
Geralt|Yeah… I'm a wild and crazy guy.
Kovir Nobleman|I've one other matter I wished to broach.
Kovir Nobleman|In a few day's time, I shall exhibit my work for some friends, my coterie, so to speak. Would you come by?
Geralt|Why not, if I'm in the area…
Kovir Nobleman|Splendid. In that case, I shall see you at my lodgings. I'm staying with a friend while in Toussaint, near a village named Francollarts.
Geralt|I'll be by. See you.
Geralt|Thanks for the invitation, but don't wait up. Got more than a few of my own matters to tend to.
Kovir Nobleman|I understand. Yet should you change your mind, just come see me. I'm staying with a friend, near a village named Francollarts.
Geralt|All right, if I'm in the area. Farewell.
Kovir Nobleman|I was dead chuffed to be able to observe you in action, to confirm for myself there that the tales about you were not exaggerated in the slightest. You showed discipline, reliability, responsibility.
Kovir Nobleman|I daresay you'd make the ideal business associate. It's a shame you've no interest in the wine trade.
Geralt|One day, maybe.
Geralt|I'm not your boss - no need to kiss up to me.
Kovir Guard 01|You've read us all wrong. Count Beledal's a bit odd, aye, but a better man to serve I cannot imagine.
Kovir Guard 01|What he does for his daughter - well, speaks for itself.
Geralt|His daughter?
Geralt|New life? He was feeling down?
Kovir Nobleman|This is not what I expected. I was to immortalize the peacocks, not their butchered remains.
Geralt|I know… Sorry, instincts get the better of me sometimes.
Kovir Nobleman|Ah, I suppose I too am to blame. I should not have taken a witcher on an expedition like this, never. Ehh, let us return to camp…
<|endoftext|>
Lector|Both male and female Beauclair centipedes are formidable predators.
Lector|The beasts prefer to hunt in packs, yet the author of this extraordinary work was able to capture a lone specimen, preparing to attack.
Lector|Cast your eye on the hunter, who, though fully aware of the danger, wears a look of cold determination on his face as he awaits the optimal moment to strike.
Geralt|Ahem.
Kovir Nobleman|Ah, Geralt, you're here! Wonderful. Come, please.
Kovir Nobleman|I'm delighted to see you. I've a small gift for you, and I shan't let you refuse.
Geralt|Thanks.
Geralt|Talked to your guards back at the camp. Told me about Clarissa. Sorry to hear about her accident.
Kovir Nobleman|Thank you. Kind words that mean a great deal to me.
Geralt|How's Clarissa these days? Probably can't wait for you to get back.
Kovir Nobleman|Haha, to get her gifts, you mean. I've dispatched two already. She'll not need to wait for my return.
Kovir Nobleman|En route home, I mean to pass through Dol Blathanna. They say one can see sylvans there.
Geralt|Yeah, actually happen to know one. Name's Torque. He can be mean, but for the right fee he'll do anything you ask.
Kovir Nobleman|Splendid. I thank you for the hint.
Geralt|Tell him I send my regards.
Geralt|Good crowd. You got a lot of friends… All of 'em seem to be fawning over your paintings, too.
Kovir Nobleman|Oh, when you've as much coin as I do, friends buzz around like flies on fresh meat. And they praise you to high heavens for each trip, burp and sneeze.
Kovir Nobleman|Not all are lying sycophants, that's not what I mean… just most, unfortunately.
Geralt|Why bother? Why even invite them around?
Kovir Nobleman|I'm a man of enterprise and must put my trade before any personal hatreds or sympathies. Besides…
Geralt|Besides…?
Kovir Nobleman|At times I'll exhibit a completely failed painting just to listen to them twist their tongues into knots trying to find just the right superlatives to lather on smeared rubbish.
Kovir Nobleman|Naturally, the more intent someone is to get into my good graces, the louder they praise my "masterpiece." It's devilish fun, I tell you.
Geralt|Nice meeting you. So long, now.
Kovir Nobleman|You are free to sell it, of course… Though I would be honored were you to hang it in your home.
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|Ah, master witcher, welcome. Count Beledal is expecting you.
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|He awaits in the courtyard, with the other guests.
Lector|The wilds of Toussaint harbor innumerable fascinating secrets.
Lector|Its picturesque meadows and untouched woodlands are home to one of the most dangerous species of myriopoda this side of the Yaruga.
Lector|The Beauclair centipede, as it's commonly called, is seen here proudly displaying its remarkable chitin and calcium carbonate carapace.
Kovir Nobleman|Geralt, a pleasure to see you again. What's brought you back?
Lector|It's wonderful to meet the subject of the baron's new cycle. Such an opportunity. Enjoy the exhibit.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|House of yours in White Orchard? Pretty nice. Thing is, you forgot to clean it out before setting off.
Talar|Shite. Thought I'd covered me tracks. How'd you find it?
Geralt|By accident, that took the form of a frying pan. Long story. Here's your monocle. It's broken but could still be useful.
Geralt|It's been a while. Fill me in.
Talar|Nilfgaard fuckin' dismantled the Temerian secret service in one night. I barely escaped with me life. Proceeded to drown me sorrows till my liver screamed bloody murder.
Geralt|What do you do now?
Talar|Grassroots work. I hang about the area, watchin', listenin', askin' questions, and recruitin' new agents.
Geralt|Life treating you all right?
Talar|Meh, bit like a potato beetle. I keep quiet, stay outta trouble and live on fuckin' potatoes.
Geralt|Farewell.
Talar|Yeah, I do, most of the fuckin' time, thanks.
Talar|Hm?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Got anything unusual? You know, goods you wouldn't normally show? Willing to pay a lot for things of the right… kind.
Hakland Merchant|Yes, something I had could of interest have been. Diagrams four, detailing how to forge gear fantastic . A gift for one of your kings to be they were.
Hakland Merchant|All now lost, I say sadly. I, with my companions, was on the high road. Attacked we were by locals. Of my brethren one cut down was, and our cargo all we lost.
Geralt|Mhm, lots of "locals" are like that, unfortunately. But not all.
Hakland Merchant|A particular reason you say this?
Geralt|Well, wouldn't want an Ofieri to say all easterners are thieves. Tell you what, lemme help you get those diagrams back.
Hakland Merchant|Is this truth? I should be grateful were you to find them. And in thanks draft duplicates marked in the tongue of your craftsmen. A gift for you.
Geralt|Where'd it happen, this attack?
Hakland Merchant|At a crossroads, a sawmill near to it. And the ruins of a residence to the north, I believe.
Geralt|See what I can do. Farewell.
Geralt|Just saying that even in a land as barbarous as this, you'll run into kind folk, too. Need a little luck, that's all.
Hakland Merchant|This I do not doubt. If you happen near the place where occurred this attack on us, ask, if will you, after diagrams marked in a foreign tongue.
Geralt|Where'd it happen, this attack?
Hakland Merchant|A crossroads, the ruins of a residence to its north, not far a sawmill, abandoned.
Geralt|Think I can remember that. Take care.
Geralt|Found this diagram. Think the markings might be Ofieri, can't decipher them. Willing to help?
Hakland Merchant|This writing I recognize. We arrived in this land to immediate trouble - local men. Frankly, rogues. Attacked we were.
Hakland Merchant|These are good instructions to forge fantastic gear fit for a king. To the ruler here I was to present them. But assist me, retrieve the entire set, and I shall draft duplicates marked in the tongue of your craftsmen.
Geralt|Sounds like a fair deal. Think I can probably find those diagrams for you.
Hakland Merchant|These bandits, they knights seemed. A blow even harder.
Geralt|Tempting, but I just don't have the time right now.
Hakland Merchant|I will keep hope. And give thanks should you turn your mind to searching for my diagrams when you find time.
Geralt|Where'd they attack you? And how many diagrams were there?
Hakland Merchant|Diagrams three remain missing. And the violence, at a crossroads it happened, a sawmill nearby. North of the spot, a residence, a ruin almost.
Geralt|Don't worry. I'll find your diagrams.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Hmm. A diagram? Seem to be Ofieri markings on it. Might find someone who could explain them to me.
Geralt|Interesting. Another diagram with Ofieri markings. Could use someone fluent in the tongue.
Geralt|Ofieri diagram, again. Should look around for someone who knows Ofieri.
Geralt|Ofieri diagram, another one. Useless if you don't know Ofieri, though.
Geralt|Someone was wounded. Started bleeding heavily.
Geralt|Hmm. Took a traveler hostage, I guess. Blood trail's the hostage's. Must've been a burden if they left him here to die.
Geralt|Trail ends here. Hmm. Dirt and ground cover concealing a hatch. Secret passageway?
Geralt|Bloody fight, looks like. Folk in the caravan didn't stand a chance. Tracks lead north.
Geralt|Trail's gone cold. Tsk. Need to look around, see if I can't pick it up again.
Geralt|Lost the trail. Gotta look around for something else.
Geralt|Found it! Leads this way.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Merten went to the lakeside to seek final atonement. Should look into it.
Geralt|Just like the Great Beggar described it - chapel Merten visited must be in the cave.
Geralt|Hmm… wonder if it's a relic of some sort.
Geralt|Dammit… What's going on here?
Geralt|Bruxae might've been hallucinations. Sure as hell fought as if they were real.
Geralt|Beggars? Here? Must be a test…
Geralt|Sorry, fresh out of coin.
Geralt|Last one. Wonder what'll happen now…
Geralt|Man looks a lot like Lebioda. Impossible.
Geralt|Man being swarmed by kikimores… Wonder if he's real or just an illusion.
Geralt|Nude women? In a cave? Something's not right…
Geralt|Not seeing visions anymore. Hope that's the end of that.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|More symbols… Where you gonna lead me?
Geralt|Whatever beast the witcher was hunting, doesn't seem like he killed it.
Geralt|Gotta keep my eyes peeled.
Geralt|Left his school's symbol on the wall. Clever. Gotta keep a look out for more.
Geralt|He should've never taken this risk. Must've really wanted the armor.
Geralt|Remaining diagrams at the vineyard? Maybe I can find them.
Geralt|I can probably make really good use of these diagrams.
Geralt|Collapsed building. Foundations probably caved in. Literally undermined.
Geralt|Cave entrance… Let's see if this witcher left any tracks.
Geralt|Must be the corpse of the witcher from the School of the Bear.
Geralt|Looks like he came here to hunt the shaelmaar I slew.
Geralt|Cept he failed to make it home.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Gotta find a way inside.
Geralt|Great little concealed cubby. No ordinary folk could ever reach it.
Geralt|Another tale of a life compromised and ultimately claimed by greed and ambition.
Geralt|Witcher and armorer - both had shit luck.
Geralt|Pits of Brume, hm. Strange name for a series of caverns. Should investigate.
Geralt|Wonder if the bandits got the treasure out of the cave.
Geralt|Every witcher's felt it - the urge to drop it all and ride off into the sunset.
Geralt|This one decided to act on the urge. Costs be damned.
Geralt|No one lives there anymore. Might still find some clues, though.
Geralt|Diagrams have a sad history, but I'll make good use of them.
Geralt|Damn. Tortured him.
Geralt|Must be de Launay's residence.
Geralt|Bandit camp de Launay wrote about, gotta be.
Geralt|Need to look around.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Can't activate the portal until I find the missing crystal.
Geralt|Now to activate the portal, see where it drops me.
Geralt|Moreau - yet another piece of his story.
Geralt|Hmm… Back of the diagram, Jerome made a note.
Geralt|Wonder what happened at Mont Crane?
Geralt|So the witcher was taken somewhere via portal.
Geralt|Hm, Jerome was Moreau's son. Be nice to know the full story.
Geralt|Ehh, a grim tale. But I came for the diagrams. Should be somewhere around here.
Geralt|Must be that ruined fort Lafargue mentioned. Worth a look.
Geralt|Abandoned castle mired in a dark legend - dream hideout for bandits.
Geralt|Moreau kept Jerome here. Need to look around.
Geralt|Moreau eventually came to terms with his son being a witcher.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|The bodies… Seems they were running for the exit.
Geralt|They were scholars - should've guessed the passages inside were blocked for a reason.
Geralt|Good thing they didn't try to go in there without a witcher.
Geralt|Adon came to Toussaint at Vesemir's request. Interesting.
Geralt|Too bad things ended here for this Wolf. Not many of us left alive.
Geralt|Scholars pitched camp here. Should look around.
Geralt|Magic barrier. Got a bad feeling, dammit.
Geralt|A witcher. Brought the ceiling down to bury his foes. Ended up burying himself, too.
Geralt|Satchel looks like it belonged to a witcher.

Novigrad Rich Man 02|Humblest greetings, sir! Care to peruse!
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Have a look, perhaps even procure?
Geralt|Greetings.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Salutations. Wither do you come from, and where will you go?
Geralt|Hard to say. Seen a lot of the world and plan to see more.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|As have I, as do I.
Geralt|Take a peek, if you don't mind.
Geralt|Not the best place for a traveling peddler.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Profits lie amidst risk. True, the war's brought strife and hardship - but folk live on. And where there is life, there is trade.
Geralt|Prepared to risk your life for a bit of coin?
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Coin, my friend, is of little import. Hard as I try, I simply cannot remain still. So I wander, and wander, the world.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|I see new places, speak with folk I've never known. It's what I like, and that's worth the risk.
Geralt|Nice area. Business booming, I guess?
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Travelers stream north, many refugees among them. They lack for near everything, so I make ends meet.
Geralt|Any dealings with soldiers?
Novigrad Rich Man 02|A bit of trade, a bit of bribery, extortion, too, at times. But all in all, I finish ahead.
Geralt|So close to Novigrad… Wouldn't you rather trade inside the city walls?
Novigrad Rich Man 02|The guilds entrenched there… why, their members fix prices to stifle any competition.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|I do a robust trade here, with none to pester me, no walls to ring me in. The open's a pleasure in itself, I'm certain you agree.
Geralt|Farewell.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|We'll meet again, I know this.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Hahah. Mountains don't move and thus never meet, but men…
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Been in Novigrad long?
Triss|Long enough to know how not to get caught… and survive.
Geralt|And before you came here, where were you?
Triss|Oh, places… where I managed to get by without your help, too.
Triss|Which doesn't mean I'm not happy to see you.
Geralt|See you kept the rose of remembrance I gave you in Flotsam.
Triss|Seems so long ago… Probably because so much has changed.
Geralt|So, sentimental value… that why you kept it?
Triss|Partly. Though… more as a warning.
Geralt|Your earring, am I right?
Triss|Wait a second… Yes! Lost it years ago. Where did you find it?
Geralt|Kaer Morhen. In a bed. You know the one.
Triss|Ah… yes… the good old days.
Geralt|I ever tell you you're beautiful when you blush?
Triss|Mhm. Back then. Like I said, the good old days.
Triss|Oh, my favorite earrings. I can wear them again now that I have both. Thanks, Geralt.
Geralt|Feel all right?
Triss|Hm. So-so. Why do you ask?
Geralt|When you slit Menge's throat, and then… You were fierce. Never seen that side of you.
Triss|What would you have had me do? Conjure up a cloud of butterflies?
Geralt|Not what I mean, and you know it. I'm a little worried how it might affect you.
Triss|Well, yeah, I'd probably relive it in my dreams if I wasn't already having nightmares about mages roasting on pyres.
Geralt|Been wondering - how's your hand, your fingers?
Triss|They'll heal.
Triss|Listen, it was my idea. I knew exactly what I was getting into.
Triss|Don't need to worry about me.
Geralt|Matter of that agent - still bothering you?
Triss|Of course. Pretty damn badly.
Triss|I don't want to be like them.
Geralt|You're not, never will be. Believe me.
Triss|Ugh, Geralt… if you only knew what I think… what I feel when I see the next pyre… when I find the bodies of friends and adepts… massacred so badly I can't possibly identify them…
Triss|If you knew, you wouldn't be so sure.
Geralt|Hm… Maybe we should talk about something else?
Triss|Gladly. I was about to ask the same.
Geralt|Back there at the Kingfisher…
Triss|Oh, you really want to talk about it? Maybe I should get Yennefer? Wouldn't want her to miss any of this.
Geralt|Hm, no. You're right, bad idea.
Geralt|So, there you were in Putrid Grove, and out of nowhere I show up. What did you think?
Triss|Honestly? "Oh no, not him again."
Geralt|Figured as much. You weren't easy to find, you know.
Triss|You'd recovered your memory, found Yennefer. So naturally, I thought the two of you'd--
Geralt|But it turned out my amnesia'd changed nothing. Wanted to be with you before, during, after - always.
Triss|I know that now.
Geralt|You, uh, holding up all right?
Triss|Ugh, it'll be a hard slog for everyone…
Geralt|You know what I mean.
Triss|What'm I supposed to say? I mean, I knew you and Yennefer… that you'd end up back together. It was a lost cause, always.
Geralt|I guess so. I just don't want you to--
Triss|Can we not dwell on it? I need to focus on other things now.
Geralt|Right. Understood.
Geralt|Listen, think you could help me with this mark? It's driving me crazy.
Triss|Tsk… Oh Geralt… What've you gotten yourself into now?
Geralt|Long story. Can you get rid of this thing?
Triss|Afraid not. And I doubt anyone else'll be able to, either. So sorry.
Geralt|Agh… Folk give me strange looks anyway. Guess I  oughta be used to it.
Geralt|So long, Triss.
Triss|Yes, Geralt?
<|endoftext|>
Triss|What're you doing?
Triss|Hah!
Triss|Enough!
Triss|Aaaghhh!
Triss|You should've run!
Triss|Not about to let you off!
Triss|Here's something.
Triss|Geralt, look.
Triss|Geralt, you'll hurt someone.
Triss|Uhhh!
Triss|You're dead, you're gone.
Triss|Well?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|The fight for the throne's grown fierce.
Udalryk|Strife 'tween siblings is never good. I know from experience.
Udalryk|Hjalmar's ambitious, but to a fault. We'd all be better off were his sister to win.
Geralt|Really think so, or is that gratitude speaking?
Udalryk|I am grateful, as Hemdall's my witness. No one's ever done more for me than you and that lass.
Udalryk|More important, she showed great cunning and courage. Qualities the Isles need now more than ever.
Geralt|What do you think of Skellige's new ruler?
Udalryk|The better claimant won.
Udalryk|Hjalmar's a fierce and able warrior, that's clear, but he'll never make a good king.
Udalryk|Worst possible claimant won. We'll all regret it, mark my words.
Geralt|Farewell.
Geralt|Remember me, Jarl?
Udalryk|I remember, Geralt. I remember.
Udalryk|Forgive me, the gods speak.
Udalryk|Geralt, friend. What brings you here?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Can we talk?
Geralt|You think universals exist as real and distinct entities, or only as mental constructs?
Ugliest Man Alive|Umaumaumauma mauma eme eme eme eme.
Geralt|Mhm. So do I.
Geralt|I'm looking for Ciri. Ashen hair, scar on her cheek. Seen her?
Ugliest Man Alive|Uma! Uma! Umamama!
Geralt|How can I help you?
Ugliest Man Alive|Uma uma.
Geralt|So long.
<|endoftext|>
Ves|Geralt, restrain yourself.
Ves|Yes! Yes!
Ves|Aaaahh!
Ves|That all you can muster?
Ves|Fuck.
Ves|What?! Your bollocks drop off?!
Ves|Temeria!
Ves|Is that it? You done?
Ves|Yes?
<|endoftext|>
Vesemir|Yes? What is it, Wolf?
Geralt|Realize it's been half a year since we hunted down that fiend in Vorune?
Vesemir|Yes. Though that was more than a fiend. What was that bastard's name? Drugan? May the soil lie light upon him.
Vesemir|Things used to be simpler. Monsters were bad, humans good. Now, everything's all confused.
Geralt|Used to be exactly the same. You've just forgotten.
Vesemir|Do well not to point up my age. You're near a century old yourself.
Geralt|No offense, but… why all the construction?
Vesemir|So the roof tiles don't drop on our heads?
Geralt|Roof tiles usually fall from the roof. You're putting up walls, rebuilding the fortress… for three people. Why?
Vesemir|Because I remember how it was, Wolf, before the massacre. We were twenty, and that's just teachers. As for candidates…
Vesemir|I can't turn back the clock, I know. But I refuse to just sit and stare at these ruins.
Geralt|So, ready for battle? How do you feel?
Vesemir|Old.
Vesemir|If things don't go as planned… take Ciri and run. As far away from here as you can.
Geralt|Not a chance. Won't abandon you.
Vesemir|It's not a request, Geralt.
Geralt|I know. But I'm not your student anymore.
Vesemir|Shame you aren't. 'Cause it seems there's something I failed to teach you. That at times you can't win without making a sacrifice.
Geralt|I met with Emhyr.
Vesemir|Any crowned heads you haven't met?
Geralt|A few. Hoping it stays that way.
Vesemir|Remember the first war with Nilfgaard? Battle of Sodden? The North, all of it, fought together - Temeria, Redania, Kaedwen, Aedirn… And the mages were heroes - on the field first, then in ballads.
Vesemir|Not much left of that world.
Geralt|See you later, Vesemir.

Vimme Vivaldi|Well, well! Look who's here? The White Wolf himself in my humble establishment!
Vimme Vivaldi|How can I be of service?
Geralt|I need coin. Guess I have to take out a loan?
Vimme Vivaldi|Course. I'll arrange it right away.
Geralt|Just like that?
Vimme Vivaldi|Lady Yennefer of Vengerberg long ago declared herself your guarantor - were these circumstances ever to arise.
Vimme Vivaldi|Besides, we've tried and true methods for collecting debts.
Geralt|Wanna pay back my loan.
Vimme Vivaldi|Splendid. I see you as even more credit worthy than before.
Geralt|Got a bill of exchange. Need to redeem it.
Vimme Vivaldi|I'll need a spell to verify that the issuer's credit worthy. But it shouldn't take long.
Geralt|Got some coin I'd like to convert into crowns.
Vimme Vivaldi|You've come to the right place. A better rate you'll not find anywhere in the city.
Geralt|How's business?
Vimme Vivaldi|Really? That's the best you've got? That's like asking a fisherman if they're biting, or an old gran about her health.
Vimme Vivaldi|Business is booming. There's profit to be made from war, provided you've the know-how. Before Nilfgaard had even crossed the Pontar, I'd contracted for insured deliveries of wood and iron from Kovir. Reaped a sevenfold return on my investment.
Geralt|Nice.
Vimme Vivaldi|So you might think. But then there's the nonhuman poll tax, the church's tithe, war taxes and my overhead. Subtract all that and you're left with a pittance - a dozen or so chests, and no more.
Geralt|Till next time.
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Found and killed the murderer.
Geralt|It was Hubert. You were right not to trust him. He was a higher vampire.
Von Gratz|I thought nothing could surprise me in Novigrad… Seems I was wrong. Deeply wrong.
Von Gratz|Thank you, Geralt. Were it not for you, this would never have ceased.
Geralt|It was Nathaniel. Caught him red-handed at Kate's - he was just about to cut into his next victim. Innkeeper wanted to keep me out. "Important customer," he said.
Geralt|Hubert told me about your past. Even more vivid than I'd assumed.
Von Gratz|I've not time for riddles, Geralt. Be straight or begone.
Geralt|Any truth to his claim that people died during the riots at the university? Died for your cause?
Von Gratz|I was young and stupid… I thought a better future was worth any price, even a human life or two. But those are past sins, sins I've atoned for.
Geralt|Bad news - saw another victim. Turns out Nathaniel wasn't the murderer.
Von Gratz|Blast it. Did you gather any new clues?
Geralt|No. Crime scene was completely clean. No prints, no blood, not even a hair. Murderer's learning from his or her mistakes.
Von Gratz|We've but one recourse under the circumstances - caution. Looking out for ourselves and our loves ones.
Geralt|These murders - got any suspects?
Von Gratz|No, Geralt. Though all in all I should have.
Geralt|What do you mean?
Von Gratz|By virtue of my profession, I know Novigrad's underworld better than most. Dozens of mercenaries, racketeers, bandits and hired assassins have had their turn on my operating table. Rogues, one and all.
Von Gratz|But I believe even they could not kill in this manner - so horribly cruel, yet cold, methodical, with absolute precision.
Von Gratz|Concluding this overlong explanation, I've no notion who's behind it, but I fear them like hell.
Geralt|Why's the university in Oxenfurt closed?
Von Gratz|Because it suits Radovid. You've not heard the story?
Von Gratz|The rector wished to grant him an honorary doctorate. The faculty disagreed. Nonetheless, Radovid arrived for the ceremony, donned a gown, collected his diploma… and when it was over, imprisoned the deans and the entire academic senate - so they "wouldn't raise a stink."
Von Gratz|I've been at Vilmerius Hospital ever since. But perhaps it's for the best. I'm far more adept scalpel in hand than I ever was behind a lectern.
Geralt|Know another surgeon from Oxenfurt Academy. Her name's Shani. Know her? Red hair cropped short, freckles…
Von Gratz|…and a hopeless idealist. Naturally, I know her. She was my assistant for a year.
Geralt|Any idea where she is now?
Von Gratz|My gut tells me she's somewhere along the front, patching up pikemen. I told her it would be futile. In the time she saved a hundred lives, another thousand would be lost. But medics with a mission - you can't argue with them.
Geralt|Farewell.
Von Gratz|Yes, Geralt?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|Big changes afoot in the Empire?
Voorhis|You've no notion? The emperor summoned you, he only ever summons with reason. It's clear he seeks his daughter.
Geralt|You know a lot.
Voorhis|I must. I am my father's son.
Geralt|What's your father got to do with this?
Voorhis|Hm, he is close to the emperor… and knows the opposition, knows they press for abdication. Ceding the throne to Cirilla, it's the best the emperor can do.
Voorhis|But, as is known, an empress needs an emperor at her side. My father will ensure the right man is chosen.
Geralt|Farewell.
Geralt|D'you find Derghoff?
Voorhis|Oh, yes. He was talking to some friends of my father. Poor chaps can't get their minds off politics, not for an instant.
Voorhis|I truly hope they'll allow themselves some respite after the coronation.
Voorhis|Ah, Geralt. What can I do for you?

Baron Bandit Strong 01|It's ploughin' pourin' again.

Baron Bandit Strong 01|Don't give a cryin' fuck.
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Our boys wanted to take some wenches for a roll in the hay, but the local shitpickers stood up to 'em.
Baron Bandit Strong 01|So they bound a few of the bumpkins together, then burned 'em alive in a barn!
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Die!
Baron Bandit Strong 01|Want more?
Baron Bandit Strong 01|You, White One, look like you got soused last night, too.
Baron Bandit Strong 01|What is it, grayboy?

Baron Bandit Weak 01|Kill! Kill 'im!
Baron Bandit Weak 01|All together - now!
Baron Bandit Weak 01|How, dammit?!
Baron Bandit Weak 01|Blast him!
Baron Bandit Weak 01|No!
Baron Bandit Weak 01|Boys say there's a lass round one of the villages that'll let you poke 'er for a few scraps.
Baron Bandit Weak 01|And this ain't no toothless old wench. Young and supple, braid down to her shapely arse.
Baron Bandit Weak 01|Where'd you say you heard this?

Baron Bandit Weak 02|You're a goner!
Baron Bandit Weak 02|Uh-uh-uh.

Baron Bandit Weak 03|Blast!
Baron Bandit Weak 03|You'll die in agony!
Baron Bandit Weak 03|Bid life farewell.
Baron Bandit Weak 03|Nighty-night!
Baron Bandit Weak 03|Fuckin' shiteater.
Baron Bandit Weak 03|Baron gets soused, he gets angry. And he's always drinkin'.
Baron Bandit Weak 03|Heh.

Beauclair Bastard 02|We'll boil you in a bouillabaisse!
Beauclair Bastard 02|You'll hang for that!
Beauclair Bastard 02|Tsk tsk, witcher!
Beauclair Bastard 02|Follow me! Follow me!
Beauclair Bastard 02|Whoa-ho, you shan't be needing that steel!
Beauclair Bastard 02|He's magicking!
Beauclair Bastard 02|Now why did you have to go and do that…?
Beauclair Bastard 02|That's it!
Beauclair Bastard 02|Feeling peckish? Head to the Pheasantry!
Beauclair Bastard 02|Say, do witchers eat their cheese before dessert or after?

Beauclair Bastard 03|Were I in your boots, I'd go far away. Your protectress is no longer around.
Beauclair Bastard 03|The duquessa's champion… Ptooey.
Beauclair Bastard 03|Here in Beauclair, all's right and fair!
Beauclair Bastard 03|We've got to go at him together! Together!
Beauclair Bastard 03|For Duchess Henrietta!
Beauclair Bastard 03|Mutant!
Beauclair Bastard 03|I'll tear your legs from your bum!
Beauclair Bastard 03|Damned. wandering gray-haired pee-pee-licker!
Beauclair Bastard 03|Noooo!
Beauclair Bastard 03|Think you can do whatever you please?!
Beauclair Bastard 03|Understood!
Beauclair Bastard 03|Sheathe that blade, you twit!
Beauclair Bastard 03|Watch out! He's a witcher!
Beauclair Bastard 03|I knew you for a scallywag from the start!
Beauclair Bastard 03|That's better.
Beauclair Bastard 03|Have your chit-chat with someone else.
Beauclair Bastard 03|Begone from my sight.

Beauclair Bastard 04|Botch my bum, vampires! Real live, flesh, filth and blood vampires…!
Beauclair Bastard 04|All is in order!
Beauclair Bastard 04|Keep calm! Start no brawls!
Beauclair Bastard 04|Don't let him gain momentum!
Beauclair Bastard 04|Onward! For Beauclair!
Beauclair Bastard 04|Ptooey. Your bottom's as good as kicked!
Beauclair Bastard 04|Son of a scag!
Beauclair Bastard 04|Her Grace! Anna Henrietta!
Beauclair Bastard 04|Out of my way!
Beauclair Bastard 04|Oh, damn my luck…
Beauclair Bastard 04|I know, I know - the duchess' favorite. But that doesn't mean you can twirl and do cartwheels.
Beauclair Bastard 04|Formation! Don't disperse!
Beauclair Bastard 04|Sheathe your weapon, traveler. Please?
Beauclair Bastard 04|Oh, feck! Feck, feck, fudge, crud!
Beauclair Bastard 04|Unwise through and through!
Beauclair Bastard 04|Thoroughly wise!
Beauclair Bastard 04|Is it not evident I'm busy?
Beauclair Bastard 04|Yes?

Beauclair Bastard 05|You're done for, murderer!
Beauclair Bastard 05|What's the meaning of this? Well, witcher?!
Beauclair Bastard 05|We can do it!
Beauclair Bastard 05|The blade - put it away, witcher.
Beauclair Bastard 05|Fairground trickery!
Beauclair Bastard 05|Your choice. Come here!
Beauclair Bastard 05|That's better!

Beauclair Bastard 06|Geralt of Rivia, slayer of the Beast. I am in your debt. We all are.
Beauclair Bastard 06|You can't pull one over on me, witcher. I can see you're a killer.
Beauclair Bastard 06|Stocks and the whip await those running riot! Our duchy values peace and quiet!
Beauclair Bastard 06|Look lively! Rush at him, boys!
Beauclair Bastard 06|Toussaint!
Beauclair Bastard 06|Mumsy!
Beauclair Bastard 06|You're one fast son of your mum!
Beauclair Bastard 06|Did that hurt? Dammit, did it?!
Beauclair Bastard 06|No!
Beauclair Bastard 06|Come, now, keep calm!
Beauclair Bastard 06|He shall not escape!
Beauclair Bastard 06|Witcher! You'll put someone's eye out!
Beauclair Bastard 06|Spells! He's hexing hard!
Beauclair Bastard 06|Is that how it's to be?!
Beauclair Bastard 06|That's more like it.
Beauclair Bastard 06|At your service, witcher.
Beauclair Bastard 06|Geralt of Rivia, perchance?
<|endoftext|>
Beauclair Bastard 07|Ooh! Here he comes - our hero! Geralt the Riv!
Beauclair Bastard 07|Around here, it's wine, wine and more wine! But me, I prefer brandy.
Beauclair Bastard 07|La dee dee dah dah!
Beauclair Bastard 07|Finish him good!
Beauclair Bastard 07|Death! Pain! You shall be slain!
Beauclair Bastard 07|One, two! And through and through!
Beauclair Bastard 07|Snicker-snack! Snicker-snack! Break the rotten bum hole's back!
Beauclair Bastard 07|Come rain or sun, it shall be fun!
Beauclair Bastard 07|Am I invisible?!
Beauclair Bastard 07|Try that on me, you boots of the puss!
Beauclair Bastard 07|Bloody blazes, calm down!
Beauclair Bastard 07|Onward, onward, onward!
Beauclair Bastard 07|I've got something of my own to pull out!
Beauclair Bastard 07|He's some sort of mage!
Beauclair Bastard 07|If that's your stance, then this is mine…
Beauclair Bastard 07|Much better!
Beauclair Bastard 07|Catch some winks, grab some tit - it's what life's all about, isn't it?
Beauclair Bastard 07|Brandy and bosoms - my two true loves.

Beauclair Bastard 08|That's a good lad.
Beauclair Bastard 08|Ptooey, blast, ptooey!

Beauclair Bastard 08|I'll make your bum a trumpet!
Beauclair Bastard 08|Nipping at my heels, wolfie?
Beauclair Bastard 08|Very well. Time for a lesson in law and justice…
Beauclair Bastard 08|Ooh, no, no, no! Put it away!
Beauclair Bastard 08|Thrash him, boys!
Beauclair Bastard 08|You! What the devil are you doing?!
Beauclair Bastard 08|Don't crowd around.
Beauclair Bastard 08|Nothing to see here! Move along!
Beauclair Bastard 08|The duquessa's dead, a terrible tragedy… But order in the duchy must be maintained.
Beauclair Bastard 08|Magic!
Beauclair Bastard 08|Hurraaaah!
Beauclair Bastard 08|Now you're kerflooeyed…

Beauclair Bastard 11|Ashes, ashes, the wolf falls down!
Beauclair Bastard 11|Whack him! Whack him good!
Beauclair Bastard 11|We will teach you decency!
Beauclair Bastard 11|All work and no play, right, witcher?

Beauclair Bastard 14|Aaaargh!
Beauclair Bastard 14|Surrender!
Beauclair Bastard 14|I'm too young to die!

Beauclair Bastard 16|Do I know you?

Beauclair Bastard 17|You just signed your death warrant…
Beauclair Bastard 17|I want to kill him! Me!
Beauclair Bastard 17|Don't dare to think you've got carte blanche here!

Beauclair Bastard 18|Thrust your pike, swing your sword, eradicate the witcher horde!
Beauclair Bastard 18|I'll blow your house down!
Beauclair Bastard 18|Sniff a pit, fiend scum!
Beauclair Bastard 18|Damned bedbugs. Didn't sleep a wink…

Beauclair Bastard 19|Pickled… herring… Blech…
Beauclair Bastard 19|Sheathe that blade!
Beauclair Bastard 19|Seems this is your end, Master Witcher!
Beauclair Bastard 19|Oh, we will thump you good…
Beauclair Bastard 19|Not very frisky for a witcher!
Beauclair Bastard 19|I could go for some foie gras… A nice, rich hunk, with onion and mustard seed…
Beauclair Bastard 19|I wonder what the old lady's fixing for supper.
Beauclair Bastard 19|A thousand pickled herrings!

Beauclair Bastard 21|You will rot in a dungeon!
Beauclair Bastard 21|Here we come a-walloping!
Beauclair Bastard 21|Raise no fuss! Water no wine!
Beauclair Bastard 21|Sight any sign of the Beast, report it to the Ducal Guard post haste!
Beauclair Bastard 21|So you know the duchess - do you believe that means you can do what you please?!

Beauclair Bastard 22|Heard about our Beast?
Beauclair Bastard 22|Will you help us, witcher?

Beauclair Bastard 22|There'll be naught left of you to gather!
Beauclair Bastard 22|I'm coming for you!
Beauclair Bastard 22|I'll lop off his head!
Beauclair Bastard 22|Anyone making trouble during the festival will be severely punished!
Beauclair Bastard 22|Fair folk! It's recommended you stay in your homes after dark!

Beauclair Citizen Man 01|It cannot be!
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Inconceivable…
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|They say the Beast devoured Sir Milton, armor and all. Now the medics all fear it'll come to them, begging them to soothe its heartburn!
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Can you believe the tidings from the quarry? A cow dropped from the sky in broad daylight? It's a miracle there weren't more dead!
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Guard! Help!
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Summoning a witcher, was that truly necessary? And our knights, what are they - chopped liver?
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Ahh, pecker it all.
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Without Duchess Anna Henrietta, our duchy's no duchy at all!
Beauclair Citizen Man 01|Witcher! Our duchess! How could you fail so miserably? You were to protect her!
<|endoftext|>
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|Ugh, the dungboots that visit our town. They come but to pour wine down their peasant gullets and start quarrels.
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|You'd best behave, friend. You're in Beauclair, see?
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|Sir de Peyrac-Peyran dead… How the mighty fall.
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|I would hate to come off as impertinent, but was it not you who won the tourney, Sir Graylocks?
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|I tell you, no man knows the day or the hour!
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|The merchant, the one so giddy the hanse let him go? He drank himself stupid, fell in the lake and drowned!
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|Did you hear? Some stranger from the North won the tourney. They say he's a… witchman, or something of the sort…
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|Have you heard? It's raining cows at the Ardaiso quarry! Not frogs, not cats and dogs, but cows!
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|Ahoy, ahoy.
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|I don't give a fig one way or the other.
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|You don't say?!
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|Whoa! Calm down!
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|Boor!
Beauclair Citizen Man 02|You must loosen up, else you'll pop a cork.

Beauclair Citizen Man 03|To be born in Toussaint is to be born under a lucky star.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|I'm my own master with a bottle in front of me. It's no disaster, not like a frontal lobotomy!
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Sir Geralt of Rivia! Three cheers for the tourney's victor! Hip-hip hooray-hooray-hooray!
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Sir Ravix of Fourhorn! Three cheers for the tourney's victor! Hip-hip hooray-hooray-hooray!
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Agh, during the tourney, one knight got stuck in his armor, so bent out of shape it was from repeated blows of a flail. A whole team of smiths worked half a day to get him out - but the poor chap died on them.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|The word is that witcher - you know, Her Grace's chum - posed for a painting… gearless, no less!
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|My warmest greetings.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|That's an eye-opener!
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Yes, yes. Of course. Obviously.
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|You cannot be-- You're not serious, are you?
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Hey! Excuse me!
Beauclair Citizen Man 03|Excuse me.
<|endoftext|>
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|That witcher's rather handsome.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|The duchess summoned him… I wonder what for.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|Will you stay with us, witcher? Now that you've a vineyard?
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|Hey! Geralt! All the best!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|The blacksmith's wife, she's always showing off their costlies. Yet I hear they bought it all with loans from Cianfanelli…
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|The noises at the cemetery… it's thieves ripping caskets from the ground, I'm sure. You only hear them at night, because they're scared of the Guard!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|You hear? The Ardaiso quarry's cursed. Cows fall upon it from the sky!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|Hullo!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|Lebioda's wounds…
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|Who the devil knows? Perhaps it's true.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|Are you mad?!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|Hey! You gray-haired chit!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 01|Hey there!
<|endoftext|>
Beauclair Citizen Woman 02|A witcher. That can only mean trouble.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 02|He's no hero. That's the Butcher of Blaviken…
Beauclair Citizen Woman 02|The massacre at Dun Tynne - was that your cleaver at work, too, Butcher of Blaviken?
Beauclair Citizen Woman 02|Our dearest duquessa lies dead. Thanks to you, hero!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 02|One clever sot claimed to be a medic. He ordered all who came to see him - especially the maidens - to strip… nude!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 02|A trader at market claims some foulness lurked in the cellars beneath Tufo. It made the whole vineyard shake!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 02|Have you heard? Loth Halfbreed attacked Fox Hollow! Folk say not a soul survived…
Beauclair Citizen Woman 02|Good day.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 02|Golly gee willikers…
Beauclair Citizen Woman 02|I heard about that.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 02|Help! Guards!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 02|What a brute!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 02|I'm busy. Be off.
<|endoftext|>
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|A smashing place we have, eh? Wine by the barrel, peace and quiet, lovely views…
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Eat, drink and loosen your belt! For you are in Toussaint!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Did Her Grace truly grant you a vineyard?!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Our hero, the Beastslayer!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Have you heard? Some madman's been running about the docks, waving his bare noodle at the merchants.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Those friends of history, de Savarin's oddballs… The word is they got drunk and went at each other's throats! That, or some monsters ate them…
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Yes… So the witcher's supposed to have cleared the cemetery. Brought an end to those eerie nighttime noises - they say it was wraiths arguing!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Greetings.
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|It can't be!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|You're taking the piddle!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Witcher! Are you mad?!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Behave yourself!
Beauclair Citizen Woman 03|Lebioda keep you, from hangovers, too!

Beauclair Thug Strong 01|So, Snow White, what's new?
Beauclair Thug Strong 01|Mean to hunt the Beast?
Beauclair Thug Strong 01|I'll crack, thwack and sgack you!
Beauclair Thug Strong 01|Where there is smoke, there is fire!
Beauclair Thug Strong 01|Oh, you are so bimbazzled…
Beauclair Thug Strong 01|Heighdie-heighdie-heighdie-ho!
Beauclair Thug Strong 01|A group of rogues walks amidst the trees, willies aswinging betwixt their knees!
Beauclair Thug Strong 01|When I was a little lad, my stones stank awfully bad.
Beauclair Thug Strong 01|Hoping it would cure the smell, I dipped my pouch in a well…
Beauclair Thug Strong 01|Why the wide stride? A keepsake from your stay in the clink?
<|endoftext|>
Beauclair Thug Strong 02|What? Eh? Just blasted what?
Beauclair Thug Strong 02|That duchess of ours - have you at least diddled her udders?
Beauclair Thug Strong 02|Quite the bottom, quite the bosom our duchess has, don't you think?
Beauclair Thug Strong 02|Want to learn a magic trick? It's called "fuff off."
Beauclair Thug Strong 02|Why so figly fiercely tense, friend?
Beauclair Thug Strong 02|Huh, the duquessa's dead. Something tells me you laid a hand to that, Graytufts!
Beauclair Thug Strong 02|Meat rod, meat rod, suck it hard, suck it hard!
Beauclair Thug Strong 02|You popped bum hole!
Beauclair Thug Strong 02|Filthy goatknobber!
<|endoftext|>
Beauclair Thug Strong 03|Go stir the pot elsewhere, Graylocks…
Beauclair Thug Strong 03|Learn some bleeding culture, Graylocks. You're in Toussaint.
Beauclair Thug Strong 03|Buuuurp! Ugh, blast… I hawked up a bit of sick.
Beauclair Thug Strong 03|Beat it, twit.
Beauclair Thug Strong 03|Can you do this? *Frrrrp* Bwahaharahar!!
Beauclair Thug Strong 03|I heard you did a jaunt in the joint. Is that true, Graylocks?
Beauclair Thug Strong 03|Pash off! Come here!
Beauclair Thug Strong 03|Ooh la la!
Beauclair Thug Strong 03|Goodnight, dirt urchin!

Beauclair Thug Strong 04|So, shall we dance?
Beauclair Thug Strong 04|You shoo away the Beast, sugarlips? You?
Beauclair Thug Strong 04|Grab your poker and hop to it! Boom, boom!

Beauclair Thug Weak 01|See, sugarpuss…? You banished the Beast, but duchess dumped you in the dungeon. Heheheheh.
Beauclair Thug Weak 01|You're not afraid of the blessed Beast, are you?
Beauclair Thug Weak 01|A courtesan is like a rat catcher - good for when the pussy at home grows too fat! Harharhar!

Eternal Fire Guard 01|Look awfully suspicious to me, tramp.
Eternal Fire Guard 01|Move it.
Eternal Fire Guard 01|What was that?
Eternal Fire Guard 01|Bloody hell, not again.
Eternal Fire Guard 01|Don't be stupid.
Eternal Fire Guard 01|*Cough* Nooo *snort*…
Eternal Fire Guard 01|He killed him!
Eternal Fire Guard 01|We'll not manage!
Eternal Fire Guard 01|Cover your eyes!
Eternal Fire Guard 01|Surround him!
Eternal Fire Guard 01|Quiet! Spread out!
Eternal Fire Guard 01|You'll rot in a dungeon, wretch!
Eternal Fire Guard 01|Drop your weapon!
Eternal Fire Guard 01|Waste of words.
Eternal Fire Guard 01|If they tell me to guard whores 'cause of some ripper being after them, I'll quit.
Eternal Fire Guard 01|Yes, and…?
Eternal Fire Guard 01|Got my eye on you, White One.
Eternal Fire Guard 01|Die!
Eternal Fire Guard 01|Thanks for your help, Geralt. We'd not've nabbed the bastard elsewise.
Eternal Fire Guard 01|How'd you discover it was the city coroner?
Eternal Fire Guard 01|Now, now. Place the sword in the scabbard.
Eternal Fire Guard 01|You asked for it.
Eternal Fire Guard 01|Reasonable of you.

Eternal Fire Guard 02|{*Whistles*}
Eternal Fire Guard 02|A scum's a scum's chum, but the word 'round town is Cleaver's out to kill Whoreson.
Eternal Fire Guard 02|Think that'd interest the commandant?
Eternal Fire Guard 02|Take the night shift with me?
Eternal Fire Guard 02|Stop botherin' me, for kitty tit's sake!
Eternal Fire Guard 02|There must be order.
Eternal Fire Guard 02|Move on.
Eternal Fire Guard 02|I'm watchin' you.
Eternal Fire Guard 02|They oughta never let your kind in Novigrad proper.
Eternal Fire Guard 02|Watch where you step!
Eternal Fire Guard 02|Hmm?
Eternal Fire Guard 02|We'll catch the whoreson who's doin' this.
Eternal Fire Guard 02|Who do you think you are?
Eternal Fire Guard 02|Help!
Eternal Fire Guard 02|Go right!
Eternal Fire Guard 02|No way to!
Eternal Fire Guard 02|He's castin' curses!
Eternal Fire Guard 02|Oh, you prick!

Eternal Fire Guard 02|Hmm?
Eternal Fire Guard 02|I'm warnin' you!
Eternal Fire Guard 02|That Nathaniel fellow, he was always strange. Never trusted him.. Right not to, turns out.

Eternal Fire Guard 03|I like rain. Keeps the rogues indoors.
Eternal Fire Guard 03|Heard the patrol's report: corpse gutted, eyes plucked, no evidence.
Eternal Fire Guard 03|Stop it, my head's spinning from all that yammering…
Eternal Fire Guard 03|Much longer till we get paid, you reckon?
Eternal Fire Guard 03|Probably not.
Eternal Fire Guard 03|Duty calls.

Eternal Fire Guard 03|Uh-uh.
Eternal Fire Guard 03|You did the right thing with the murderer. We'll have peace now.
Eternal Fire Guard 03|Know what I like you for? The fact that you dropped that whoreson coroner.

Eternal Fire Priest 01|Uh-oh.
Eternal Fire Priest 01|A woman, an herbalist, came looking for shelter.
Eternal Fire Priest 01|And the elder priest - he flew into a rage! Chased her off with a stave instead of calling the guards.
Eternal Fire Priest 01|My brethren won't believe it…
Eternal Fire Priest 01|Should I lead prayers tonight? With that murderer on the loose…?
Eternal Fire Priest 01|For the third time, I don't know.
Eternal Fire Priest 01|Eternal Fire light your path.

Eternal Fire Priest 01|You wouldn't dare…
Eternal Fire Priest 01|Muuuurder!
Eternal Fire Priest 01|…for you are our life, our strength, and our power.
Eternal Fire Priest 01|A generous donation from the jeweler's widow. Why, you could build a chapel for it!
Eternal Fire Priest 01|Eternal Fire!
Eternal Fire Priest 01|Pray.
Eternal Fire Priest 01|Baptism of Fire - do you know what it is, White-haired One?
Eternal Fire Priest 01|You have the blood of many on your conscience. I see it in your eyes.
Eternal Fire Priest 01|Thieving scum! Heeelp!
Eternal Fire Priest 01|If you're a nonhuman, you'd best flee the city.

Eternal Fire Priest 02|The rain will cleanse the city's streets of filth.
Eternal Fire Priest 02|This murderer's a demon sent by vengeful mages.
Eternal Fire Priest 02|Where did you hear that?
Eternal Fire Priest 02|Is it true Menge fornicated with a witch?
Eternal Fire Priest 02|Eternal Fire! We've spoken about this already.
Eternal Fire Priest 02|Praise the Fire.
Eternal Fire Priest 02|Whosoever sins shall burn in the Fire!
Eternal Fire Priest 02|Mages, mutants, blasphemers, cobolds. *Spits*
Eternal Fire Priest 02|Your very presence is an affront to the Eternal Fire.
Eternal Fire Priest 02|What!
Eternal Fire Priest 02|Swoooord!
Eternal Fire Priest 02|Good folk, help!
Eternal Fire Priest 02|Give me strength!
Eternal Fire Priest 02|Do you really believe you need not fear the stake?

Eternal Fire Priest 03|Brother, sister.
Eternal Fire Priest 03|Well, well, a witcher.
Eternal Fire Priest 03|Pardon me.
Eternal Fire Priest 03|What just happened?
Eternal Fire Priest 03|What is this?
Eternal Fire Priest 03|Don't hurt me!
Eternal Fire Priest 03|Please… I beg you…
Eternal Fire Priest 03|Fire… Fire burns in my heart!
Eternal Fire Priest 03|You'll not find any monsters in Novigrad. The Eternal Fire burns within these walls.
Eternal Fire Priest 03|Yes?
Eternal Fire Priest 03|Here to convert, perhaps?
Eternal Fire Priest 03|Robbery! Thievery!

Mage 01|Hmm… I wasn't supposed to rain.
Mage 01|They finally cornered him in an alley. So tired he barely mustered the spell.
Mage 01|As soon as he'd uttered the incantation, the air grew so thick with magic you could cut it with a knife.
Mage 01|There was but one thing he could do…
Mage 01|Never thought I'd live to see times like these.
Mage 01|I can't believe it. I simply can't.
Mage 01|Are you suggesting Merigold profits from all this havoc?
Mage 01|You forget who you're talking to.
Mage 01|Master witcher?
Mage 01|Yeees?
Mage 01|Well, well, Geralt of Rivia in the flesh.
Mage 01|A legend cannot be killed, can it?
Mage 01|Who do you hunt, White Wolf?
Mage 01|Ah, sorry.

Mage 01|Someone help me!
Mage 01|Sigh…
Mage 01|Ah yes, good day.
<|endoftext|>
Mage 02|Aaaaaah.
Mage 02|He blew himself up. Understand? Exploded. Took a good lot with him…
Mage 02|Four hunters, three Temple Guards… a beggar, and a dog.
Mage 02|Enough.
Mage 02|Sorcerer who sought shelter in Silverton - has he been captured? What do you think?
Mage 02|Don't push.
Mage 02|The sword is un… necessary.
Mage 02|Desist!
Mage 02|Good sir?
Mage 02|Please, leave me alone.
Mage 02|A mutated monster slayer - fascinating example of genetic engineering…
Mage 02|Your white hair - an aberration resulting from deviation from the norms during the Trial of the Grasses, correct?
Mage 02|Do you really wish me to comment?
Mage 02|Greetings.
Mage 02|We must be strong together!
Mage 02|What if it's true and one of us has sold out to Radovid?
Mage 02|I never thought I'd say this… But all we can do is pray.

Mage 03|Carry the seven makes forty, now deduct eleven…
Mage 03|Gives two hundred ninety-eight and half quarts of rain per square fathom.
Mage 03|They've invented this new machine. Makes torture so painful…
Mage 03|…the stake seems a blessing afterwards.
Mage 03|The group that hid in the old warehouse… refused to be taken alive.
Mage 03|Someone's managed to flee Novigrad. Do you know who?
Mage 03|I'm sorry, but I refuse to answer the question.
Mage 03|Greetings.
Mage 03|How are you?
Mage 03|The famed White Wolf, I bow before you.
Mage 03|Can I help you? In any way?
Mage 03|Rumor has it you murdered Foltest. Might I suggest it's Radovid's turn?
Mage 03|I once knew this sorcerer, had a terrible aversion towards witchers. Istredd. That was his name - Val Istredd.
Mage 03|What was that?!
Mage 03|Hold on, wait…
Mage 03|Please, no…
Mage 03|I do not want to hear this.
Mage 03|If this makes its way around the guild…

Novigrad Bard 01|I'm singin' in the rain, and slippin' just the same…
Novigrad Bard 01|They say the Temple Guard interrupted the "Sorcerer's Apprentice," dispersed the crowd!
Novigrad Bard 01|Court wants to commission me to pen a panegyric. Should I accept? What do you think?
Novigrad Bard 01|I don't know.
Novigrad Bard 01|How are you faring?
Novigrad Bard 01|Fortune favor you.
Novigrad Bard 01|Yes, master?
Novigrad Bard 01|The threatening stride, the gaze, oh so fierce. Mock a witcher just once, and your gut he could pierce…
Novigrad Bard 01|Humph. Want a hug?
Novigrad Bard 01|What was that?
Novigrad Bard 01|Eternal Fire!!
Novigrad Bard 01|I'm a pacifist!
Novigrad Bard 01|Mummy!
Novigrad Bard 01|Eyes see, ears hear, but lips are shut.
Novigrad Bard 01|They shoved a mandolin up his arse just for playing impolitic couplets?! A flute, I might survive, but a mandolin?
Novigrad Bard 01|Unbelievable.
Novigrad Bard 01|In springtime the roads wet with rain, the sun bright and warming our hearts…
Novigrad Bard 01|For a Riv, it never rains, does it? It pours.
Novigrad Bard 01|La la la liii, ha ha ha haaa!

Novigrad Bard 02|You call this rain? You've clearly not seen true precipitation!
Novigrad Bard 02|A fortnight in a cell and a smashed lute - that's the price he paid for a couplet about the hierarch.
Novigrad Bard 02|My mates from the ensemble must hear about this!
Novigrad Bard 02|Now do you understand why a zither's better than a common lute?
Novigrad Bard 02|Sure.
Novigrad Bard 02|Hello-ee!
Novigrad Bard 02|Hahahahahahahahahaha…
Novigrad Bard 02|Nice do!
Novigrad Bard 02|You know the ballad of Wanda, uh, who scorned a Nilfgaardian?

Novigrad Bard 03|Does Irina need new players or not?
Novigrad Bard 03|I believe someone promised not to dwell on the subject…

Novigrad Boy 02|My uncle's in the circus, 'cause he can swallow swords. Can you?
Novigrad Boy 02|Saw a dead man yesterday! Smelled funny and had no eyes!
Novigrad Boy 02|Yeah!

Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Oh, that's bad luck.
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|And she replied, "Religion is the opium of the masses."
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|And that she'll not beg anyone for her life!
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Then the flames flared up, licking the rooftops! She hadn't the time to scream.
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Blimey…
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|The new fee, for the Big Four… Will you pay it?
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Dammit, I don't know.
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Good day.
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|I don't believe I know you.
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Begone.
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Ahem, washed your hair lately?
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Damnation!
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Guard! Guard!
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Murder! Someone help me, please!
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Eternal Fire, if your light of truth were to blind him…
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|…as he ascended the stairs… With any luck he'd trip and smash his mug.
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Want my advice? Dump all this rubbish in the channel.
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|What you have here is shit, not wares.
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Sod off.
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Well, well, another freak. Pah.
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Listen, there's more! Word is she's not his daughter at all…
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Really…
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Must you really repeat this nonsense?
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Think you can steal from me? Guards!
Novigrad Citizen Man 01|Saw you portside… Just before the blaze broke out at the hunters' haunt…

Novigrad Citizen Man 02|Hey you! Yes, you! Have you water on the brain?
Novigrad Citizen Man 02|…at that brothel, why, they'll even let you take a goat.
Novigrad Citizen Man 02|Yes, yes. Definitely. Of course.
Novigrad Citizen Man 02|You expect me to believe that?
Novigrad Citizen Man 02|Oi! Think he can get his wife out of the dungeon?
Novigrad Citizen Man 02|Hmm, I'd say so.
Novigrad Citizen Man 02|Ehhh… Greetings…

Novigrad Citizen Man 02|Youth these days - hare-brained, all of them!
Novigrad Citizen Man 02|Guards! Just wait, they'll drag you away in shackles!
Novigrad Citizen Man 02|Now they've got their new king, perhaps the Skelligers'll calm down…?
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Rain again. Damned mages.
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Know what she drinks in the evening before she retires? Not milk - but blood.
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|From a sorcerer's skull.
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|And it's a sorcerer's blood, of course.
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Must say I'm curious what my wife would say about that.
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|He must be a mage, that barber. To heal your daughter in a day?
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|I shall pretend I did not hear that.
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Kiss a dog's arse.
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Fare thee unwell.
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Yes?
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|I'm sick, sick of it all.

Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Guaaaards!
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Mercy!
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Oh, for a rain of fire and brimstone that would burn this ploughing city to ash.
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Same shit as always? You ever get new wares?
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Piss off.
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Another drifter in from Temeria.
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|Guards! Help!
Novigrad Citizen Man 03|We'll have order at last! Long live Radovid! Hail the mage hunters!

Novigrad Citizen Woman 01|Rain. The one thing that's ploughing free in this city.
Novigrad Citizen Woman 01|Jeweler's widow gave her whole inheritance to the priests!
Novigrad Citizen Woman 01|I'm at a loss for words!
Novigrad Citizen Woman 01|Will you have your rags properly laundered? Or go to the fountain again?
Novigrad Citizen Woman 01|We've spoken about it already, haven't we?
Novigrad Citizen Woman 01|Be well!
Novigrad Citizen Woman 01|My regards to you.
Novigrad Citizen Woman 01|What do you want of me?
Novigrad Citizen Woman 01|You must sweat like swine in that jacket.

Novigrad Citizen Woman 01|You are the light that never fades…
Novigrad Citizen Woman 01|Ugh…
Novigrad Citizen Woman 01|Good sir…
Novigrad Citizen Woman 01|Not a headache again…
Novigrad Citizen Woman 01|There are rumors about her. All kinds of rumors.
Novigrad Citizen Woman 01|Even that she… flies to sabbaths on a broomstick.
Novigrad Citizen Woman 01|Tell me you jest.
Novigrad Citizen Woman 01|Robbery in broad daylight! Guards!
Novigrad Citizen Woman 01|Those sadists ought to change their name now - to nonhuman hunters.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Citizen Woman 02|When it rains, it pours.
Novigrad Citizen Woman 02|She's left herself nothing. Gave every last copper to the church…
Novigrad Citizen Woman 02|Eternal Fire! You don't mean it…
Novigrad Citizen Woman 02|Your husband seeks other employment? Why? Is he unhappy with the coin changer?
Novigrad Citizen Woman 02|Akh akh akh… Eternal Fire!
Novigrad Citizen Woman 02|Good day!
Novigrad Citizen Woman 02|May the Eternal Fire light your path!
Novigrad Citizen Woman 02|Your peepers. So strange.
Novigrad Citizen Woman 02|Did you see those poor wretches who fled Velen?
Novigrad Citizen Woman 02|Don't touch me!
Novigrad Citizen Woman 02|Murderer! Murderer!
Novigrad Citizen Woman 02|Help meee!
Novigrad Citizen Woman 02|Hmm, how did that… Eternal Fire, light my path, give me strength, warm my bath…
Novigrad Citizen Woman 02|A discount - would you give me one?
Novigrad Citizen Woman 02|Greetings.
Novigrad Citizen Woman 02|Oof, I've worked up quite the appetite!

Novigrad Citizen Woman 03|That famous bard… what's his name - the celebrity! They wanted to throw even him in a dungeon!
Novigrad Citizen Woman 03|Lebioda wept…
Novigrad Citizen Woman 03|Do you really see your son as a monk?
Novigrad Citizen Woman 03|What can I say? I don't know. I just don't know.
Novigrad Citizen Woman 03|Hello.
Novigrad Citizen Woman 03|I wish you luck. You'll need it.

Novigrad Dockworker 02|And 'stead of droppin' his body in the nearest channel…
Novigrad Dockworker 02|He diced it up real fine. Made some headcheese!

Novigrad Dockworker 03|They're eatin' moss other side o' the Pontar! Bow wow mutton's a delicacy o'er there!
Novigrad Dockworker 03|Eternal Fire…
Novigrad Dockworker 03|Got that twinge in me back again…
Novigrad Dockworker 03|Ugh, you look awful. Then again, who doesn't these days…
Novigrad Dockworker 03|Haven't arf' arf' an arf'ed it with you. Sod off.
Novigrad Dockworker 03|Swords? Wise. Not safe 'round here.
Novigrad Dockworker 03|Watch where you're walkin'!
Novigrad Dockworker 03|Buzz off, mate.
Novigrad Dockworker 03|You that madman wanted to sail to Skellige?
Novigrad Dockworker 03|You cheeky whoreson. Help!
Novigrad Dockworker 03|See the hunters' house go up in flames? They must've seen the smoke in Skellige!

Novigrad Female Bard 01|Ta ra ta ra ta raa. Du pa ra ra raa…
Novigrad Female Bard 01|Have you heard? Some circus troupe's angered Menge!
Novigrad Female Bard 01|I'd rather not hear this.
Novigrad Female Bard 01|I wonder if anyone in Novigrad would stage the work of a novice.
Novigrad Female Bard 01|My answer is no. And don't ask me again.
Novigrad Female Bard 01|How fare you?
Novigrad Female Bard 01|You look dapper today.
Novigrad Female Bard 01|Hullo, sourpuss!
Novigrad Female Bard 01|My, what a sour mug! Did you mistake vinegar for mead?
Novigrad Female Bard 01|Gray, but so coarse!
Novigrad Female Bard 01|Hey, what--?
Novigrad Female Bard 01|Poor thing.
Novigrad Female Bard 01|Whaaa…
Novigrad Female Bard 01|I beg you… help!
Novigrad Female Bard 01|Where do you hear these tales?
Novigrad Female Bard 01|Apparently, some dwarf's opened a brothel in Novigrad…
Novigrad Female Bard 01|They say he's got she-dwarves, she-gnomes, and a two-headed she-troll!
Novigrad Female Bard 01|Don't stick your neck out, White One. You're liable to lose it.
Novigrad Female Bard 01|This is no country for troubadours…
Novigrad Female Bard 01|Well! You're easy enough on the eye.
Novigrad Female Bard 01|Sticky fingers, have we?
Novigrad Female Bard 01|So Hubert Rejk was a monster…?
Novigrad Female Bard 01|So holy boy Nathaniel was a monster…?

Novigrad Female Bard 02|I should've played that music hall - my arse wouldn't be so wet.
Novigrad Female Bard 02|The guards nabbed him, started ripping out his nails. And he gave up their hideout right quick.
Novigrad Female Bard 02|Horseshit, that's what.
Novigrad Female Bard 02|It's nice enough as a tavern, but the pay's dismal. I honestly don't know if I should take the work.
Novigrad Female Bard 02|But of course!
Novigrad Female Bard 02|Ahahahaha! Heeheeheehee!
Novigrad Female Bard 02|Good morning!
Novigrad Female Bard 02|Yes, handsome?
Novigrad Female Bard 02|Cut yourself while shaving?
Novigrad Female Bard 02|Darnit!
Novigrad Female Bard 02|Guards! Guards!
Novigrad Female Bard 02|Noooooooooo!
Novigrad Female Bard 02|Well, hellooooooo.
Novigrad Female Bard 02|I need that lute I saw at market yesterday. I'd sell my soul to the devil to get it…
Novigrad Female Bard 02|Thiieeeeeeef!
Novigrad Female Bard 02|"The Doppler's Salvation" - quite the rousing little play.
Novigrad Female Bard 02|"A Changeling Rescued, or the Witcher's Triumph" - quite the rousing little play.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Female Bard 03|The city weeps 'neath its veil of rain…
Novigrad Female Bard 03|You needn't believe me, but even the Temple Guard's afraid to go out nights.
Novigrad Female Bard 03|Yeeees, I'd heard that, too.
Novigrad Female Bard 03|Should I see that philanderer again, or is it just a bad idea?
Novigrad Female Bard 03|What do you think?
Novigrad Female Bard 03|My my, who do my lovely eyes spy?
Novigrad Female Bard 03|Hullo!
Novigrad Female Bard 03|A minor or D minor?
Novigrad Female Bard 03|I doubt you know many rolled chords…
Novigrad Female Bard 03|Clumsy oaf!
Novigrad Female Bard 03|Hit a woman, would you?
Novigrad Female Bard 03|Ah! Oh, help!
Novigrad Female Bard 03|Hmmm… Hm hm.
Novigrad Female Bard 03|Hm, I really thought witchers would look more… witchery.
Novigrad Female Bard 03|Somebody call the guards!
Novigrad Female Bard 03|Did you hear? Dandelion's been found! I was so sad with him away…
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Girl 01|Uuuuugh…
Novigrad Girl 01|When guards came to take the lady next door away, she screamed real loud and turned some of them into frogs!
Novigrad Girl 01|Oh bollocks!
Novigrad Girl 01|Will you run away from home with me?
Novigrad Girl 01|Are you joking?
Novigrad Girl 01|Hullo!
Novigrad Girl 01|Hurray!
Novigrad Girl 01|That hurts!
Novigrad Girl 01|Oh! Oh!
Novigrad Girl 01|Daddy!
Novigrad Girl 01|Teeheeheehee! Aheeheehee! Hahaha! Oo hmhmhm.
Novigrad Girl 01|A wolf ate my gran!
Novigrad Girl 01|Mister, why are your eyes so strange?
Novigrad Girl 01|My dad doesn't like elves very much? Are you an elf?
Novigrad Girl 01|I'm not lying! Elves took him, I heard my parents say so!
Novigrad Girl 01|Woo-hh-woow!
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Girl 02|Can't let my jacket get wet again. I'll get lashed…
Novigrad Girl 02|I've been to a witch-burning! Stank so bad I had to plug my nose.
Novigrad Girl 02|Oh my!
Novigrad Girl 02|Want to play blind man's bluff?
Novigrad Girl 02|All right! But in a minute.
Novigrad Girl 02|Hey!
Novigrad Girl 02|Hello.
Novigrad Girl 02|I don't know you. Go away.
Novigrad Girl 02|Daddy will get mad if he sees me talking to you…
Novigrad Girl 02|My daddy's a witch hunter and chases old crones!
Novigrad Girl 02|Are you a wizard?
Novigrad Girl 02|Excuse me.
Novigrad Girl 02|Everyone! Run!
Novigrad Girl 02|Waa waaa waaa!
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Girl 03|I'm bored!
Novigrad Girl 03|The redheaded witch got away! Flew off on her broom!
Novigrad Girl 03|Nice!
Novigrad Girl 03|Stole my brother's sling. Will you go rat hunting with me?!
Novigrad Girl 03|Course I will!
Novigrad Girl 03|Hahahaha!
Novigrad Girl 03|My mummy says hello!
Novigrad Girl 03|Good golly! A witcher!
Novigrad Girl 03|Take me along on the Path?
Novigrad Girl 03|Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, Catch a witcher by the toe. If he sees you, let him go, Run away, and don't be slow.
Novigrad Girl 03|Can I become a witcherette? Please, please, please?!
Novigrad Girl 03|That hurt!
Novigrad Girl 03|Aaaaa!
Novigrad Girl 03|Help!
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Nobleman 01|This weather makes me downright melancholy.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|You will see. Radovid will move Redania's capital to Novigrad.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Honestly? I'm not interested.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|You still aim to get ten cases of Est Est for the feast?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|I'm not certain I understand.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Enchanted.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Pleasure's all mine.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Why would a witcher come here?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|You'll not find much to do in Novigrad.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Sirrah, what is this?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Deepest apologies.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Aaah!
Novigrad Nobleman 01|I entreat you to protect me, I surrender myself unto you.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Certainly doesn't look very enticing.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|And the madman running about town, gutting beggars and prostitutes…
Novigrad Nobleman 01|I've no doubt it's another of Menge's ideas for "cleansing" the city.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Every time I hear something of the sort I cannot help thinking…
Novigrad Nobleman 01|…that it could very well be time for a change of scenery. Kovir, perhaps?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Yes?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|You are the famed Geralt of Rivia, are you not?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|I've heard ballads about you. And that sorceress of yours, Guinevere.
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Where are the guards?
Novigrad Nobleman 01|Have you paid Radovid? His new war tax? I will not, I refuse!
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Nobleman 02|Mushy poulaines…
Novigrad Nobleman 02|…to think a whole garrison will be stationed here - in the free city of Novigrad.
Novigrad Nobleman 02|I'm sorry, but I don't believe it.
Novigrad Nobleman 02|Is it your belief Novigrad stands to gain from being annexed by Redania?
Novigrad Nobleman 02|Naturally.
Novigrad Nobleman 02|Greetings.
Novigrad Nobleman 02|Salut!
Novigrad Nobleman 02|I'm listening, sirrah.
Novigrad Nobleman 02|Been to Vizima? The word is it's more like a pig sty than a capital.
Novigrad Nobleman 02|Calm down!
Novigrad Nobleman 02|Are you mad?
Novigrad Nobleman 02|Spare me!
Novigrad Nobleman 02|Oh, Eternal One!
Novigrad Nobleman 02|Pff, measly selection.
Novigrad Nobleman 02|The baths are in Silverton. I highly recommend you visit.
Novigrad Nobleman 02|Hm hm.
Novigrad Nobleman 02|You thieving bastard! Guards!
Novigrad Nobleman 02|Nilfgaard has sailed for Skellige. Radovid occupies Novigrad. It's war, witcher.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Nobleman 03|The Pontar will rise yet again.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Very well, but what about the trade we do with the empire?
Novigrad Nobleman 03|We shall lose our shares in the maritime companies.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Such are the times, my good fellow.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|I suppose so, but will we actually profit from this?
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Pfff, oaf.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Please accept my most heartfelt regards!
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Don't be brash.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Back again, Rivian tramp?
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Watch it, peasant!
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Weapon!
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Have mercy on me!
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Ahh…
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Are you certain your goods are fresh?
Novigrad Nobleman 03|You lumpenproletarian.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|I bid you a cool farewell.
Novigrad Nobleman 03|We shall talk about this later, all right?
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Help! Guards!
Novigrad Nobleman 03|Away with you, charlatan, or I will summon the mage hunters.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Noblewoman 01|My hair, just done! The rain will ruin it!
Novigrad Noblewoman 01|absolutely impossible, in my humble opinion.
Novigrad Noblewoman 01|You agree with the priests?
Novigrad Noblewoman 01|Naturally.
Novigrad Noblewoman 01|My friend's chambermaid has gone missing!
Novigrad Noblewoman 01|The Temple Guard has refused to search for her? Can you believe it?
Novigrad Noblewoman 01|You look positively charming.
Novigrad Noblewoman 01|Good day, good day!
Novigrad Noblewoman 01|Do you think it becoming to disturb a lady, hmm?
Novigrad Noblewoman 01|Capital of the world, they call it. But what's it matter when superstition and the frocked ones rule Novigrad…?
Novigrad Noblewoman 01|Hold on!
Novigrad Noblewoman 01|Oh my!
Novigrad Noblewoman 01|Someone help me!
Novigrad Noblewoman 01|I kneel before You, oh Eternal Fire.
Novigrad Noblewoman 01|Pretty, that.
Novigrad Noblewoman 01|Mhm?
Novigrad Noblewoman 01|You're here with the circus, yes?
Novigrad Noblewoman 01|I am not a racist. Human, elf, dwarf - it matters not, provided he's well-mannered.
Novigrad Noblewoman 01|Likely they shall find her blue in the Pontar!
Novigrad Noblewoman 01|Though some say she ran off with a Nilfgaardian, a spy.
Novigrad Noblewoman 01|Who knows? Maybe it's true?
Novigrad Noblewoman 01|Thief!
Novigrad Noblewoman 01|At the Vegelbuds' feast - a brawl. The city swarming with rogues… Novigrad is not what it used to be.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Someone at the ball said that thug used to be a Redanian count!
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Unbelievable.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Well, it only just stopped!
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|We've talked about this, numerous times…
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|How are you?
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Changeling freak.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Greetings.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Does your husband plan to continue to trade with the empire?
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Stop staring or I shall call the guards.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Lout!
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Guards!
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Eternal Fire!
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Give me respite, give me hope…
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|This? At that price? Heh!
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Pfff.
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|We pay taxes, support the Temple Guard, and still they let in this rabble?
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|Rape!
Novigrad Noblewoman 02|It was you! You captured that rogue, that butcher of innocents.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|This weather draws me down, it does.
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|To threaten one nobly born with a whip?
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|For refusing to bow before a chapel?!
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|My husband will faint when he hears this…
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|Will you sell that racing mare of yours?
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|Could you repeat that?
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|When will the next witch burn, I wonder…
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|Greetings to you and your family.
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|There's still blood on your swords!
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|There's a laundry in Farcorners, did you know? They'll wash your clothing for you there.
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|Watch where you step.
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|Don't be unreasonable!
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|No! I don't want to die…
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|Deliver our children from every evil.
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|Eeeh.
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|Have you long been in Novigrad, sir?
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|How do you dye your hair? Is it a brew of parsley root?
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|Guards! Help!
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|Greetings.
Novigrad Noblewoman 03|My husband and I, we would flee to Kovir - were it not for those raiders… A new monarch in Skellige, yet nothing's changed!
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Old Man 01|Oi! Beware the gutters!
Novigrad Old Man 01|Guard kicked his face in. Lost so many teeth he'll be slurpin' soup the rest of his life!
Novigrad Old Man 01|I'm not certain I believe that…
Novigrad Old Man 01|Know what they're sayin'?
Novigrad Old Man 01|Of course.
Novigrad Old Man 01|Salutations.
Novigrad Old Man 01|Hm.
Novigrad Old Man 01|Not from around here, are you?
Novigrad Old Man 01|Mind the guards. They're worse than thugs.
Novigrad Old Man 01|Oh!
Novigrad Old Man 01|Mercy!
Novigrad Old Man 01|Don't do anything stupid!
Novigrad Old Man 01|My health - it's all I ask for.
Novigrad Old Man 01|Oh, lovely trifles…
Novigrad Old Man 01|The impudence! You heard? Some cobold, some godless dwarf's opened a brothel…
Novigrad Old Man 01|Uses she-ogres as courtesans!
Novigrad Old Man 01|Eh, right…
Novigrad Old Man 01|Yes?
Novigrad Old Man 01|Eh, to leave this city somehow…
Novigrad Old Man 01|You all right? You're pale as death.
Novigrad Old Man 01|Eternal Fire… Guards!
Novigrad Old Man 01|Heard they've the black pox other side of the river… And you, you don't look well to me!
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Old Man 02|Rain was comin'. Felt it in my bones…
Novigrad Old Man 02|Why'd they descend on him? He was sellin' love talismans!
Novigrad Old Man 02|Go on!
Novigrad Old Man 02|Can you pay him what he wants?
Novigrad Old Man 02|Meh!
Novigrad Old Man 02|Akh akh akh ptooey!
Novigrad Old Man 02|Ah yes, greetings, welcome!
Novigrad Old Man 02|Wanders 'round pesterin' folk.
Novigrad Old Man 02|Nonhuman, are you? Look for your kind beyond the walls.
Novigrad Old Man 02|Buzz off.
Novigrad Old Man 02|Mugger!
Novigrad Old Man 02|Spare me…
Novigrad Old Man 02|To thee, Eternal Fire, I entrust my soul!
Novigrad Old Man 02|Wares are impressive, but the stall keeper's a bastard.
Novigrad Old Man 02|Leave me be.
Novigrad Old Man 02|The folk in this city… racial hygiene's as poor as…
Novigrad Old Man 02|…their personal hygiene.
Novigrad Old Man 02|Gobbers! Sneeves!
Novigrad Old Man 02|Hags would've burnt the city down! Fortunately, we've the hunters to protect us.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Old Man 03|Gods damn this weather.
Novigrad Old Man 03|They beat his face to a pulp…
Novigrad Old Man 03|…and threw him in a cell for three nights. All for a handful of amulets.
Novigrad Old Man 03|I even heard about that!
Novigrad Old Man 03|Did you get your scrofula ointment?
Novigrad Old Man 03|What now?
Novigrad Old Man 03|How are you farin'?
Novigrad Old Man 03|When it rains, it pours.
Novigrad Old Man 03|Them Temerians - cowards all! Fled across the Pontar, 'stead of defendin' their fatherland…!
Novigrad Old Man 03|Your blades - why not at your waist, like everyone else?
Novigrad Old Man 03|Ho, there!
Novigrad Old Man 03|Have mercy on me.
Novigrad Old Man 03|By Lebioda's wounds!
Novigrad Old Man 03|Guards!
Novigrad Old Man 03|Pretty, but blooming expensive!
Novigrad Old Man 03|Mhm?
Novigrad Old Man 03|The power of the Eternal Fire be with you.
Novigrad Old Man 03|Guards! Help!
Novigrad Old Man 03|A wench on the throne?! Only the Skelligers could think of it.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Old Woman 01|But I just hung the laundry!
Novigrad Old Woman 01|So his mother paid Mr. Reuven, and they let the boy go.
Novigrad Old Woman 01|Eternal Fire!
Novigrad Old Woman 01|Will you finish the work on time?
Novigrad Old Woman 01|You jest!
Novigrad Old Woman 01|Eternal Fire be praised.
Novigrad Old Woman 01|Eh, I've not the strength.
Novigrad Old Woman 01|Leave me be.
Novigrad Old Woman 01|Akh akh akh akh akh…
Novigrad Old Woman 01|Ouch!
Novigrad Old Woman 01|Leg it, good folk!
Novigrad Old Woman 01|Mercy…
Novigrad Old Woman 01|A stall with rubbish shan't survive for long. Hm!
Novigrad Old Woman 01|Eternal Fire, deliver us from all evil, in body and soul.
Novigrad Old Woman 01|Horrid massacre, it was. They say the mages fought bravely…
Novigrad Old Woman 01|But finally they flushed them out with fire and riddled them with arrows, like ducks!
Novigrad Old Woman 01|I'm at a loss.
Novigrad Old Woman 01|I said it already - I haven't the time!
Novigrad Old Woman 01|They're starvin' in Vizima, you know. They eat horse carcasses.
Novigrad Old Woman 01|It's not safe to go out in the streets anymore.
Novigrad Old Woman 01|Someone call the guards!
Novigrad Old Woman 01|Ah. They're true pests, those Skelligers… Perhaps that new queen'll calm them?
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Old Woman 02|It just rains and rains…
Novigrad Old Woman 02|Did you know elves now roam the city, selling fisstech to children?!
Novigrad Old Woman 02|Arrant nonsense!
Novigrad Old Woman 02|And you believe it…
Novigrad Old Woman 02|Yes.
Novigrad Old Woman 02|Will you see that drunk scag tomorrow?
Novigrad Old Woman 02|Fortune favor you!
Novigrad Old Woman 02|Take care, now!
Novigrad Old Woman 02|Oh, you frightened me!
Novigrad Old Woman 02|Odd though he is, girls can't seem to look away.
Novigrad Old Woman 02|Hey, now!
Novigrad Old Woman 02|Devils take you!
Novigrad Old Woman 02|Gods save me!
Novigrad Old Woman 02|Hear us out.
Novigrad Old Woman 02|Argh, if only my husband weren't so tight fisted…
Novigrad Old Woman 02|Yes, handsome?
Novigrad Old Woman 02|Must have broken many a heart, eh dandy?
Novigrad Old Woman 02|Robber! Help!
Novigrad Old Woman 02|"The Doppler's Salvation" - your performance was mag-ni-fi-cent!
Novigrad Old Woman 02|"A Changeling Rescued, or the Witcher's Triumph" - your performance was mag-ni-fi-cent!
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Old Woman 03|Lots of fuss over lots of rain.
Novigrad Old Woman 03|Butchered him like a pig! Plucked his eyes out!
Novigrad Old Woman 03|My sister won't believe this!
Novigrad Old Woman 03|See you tomorrow?
Novigrad Old Woman 03|I don't know yet.
Novigrad Old Woman 03|How are you faring?
Novigrad Old Woman 03|Greetings!
Novigrad Old Woman 03|Hurt your head?
Novigrad Old Woman 03|That emperor'll choke to death on Novigrad.
Novigrad Old Woman 03|Watch where you step!
Novigrad Old Woman 03|Save yourselves!
Novigrad Old Woman 03|Help!
Novigrad Old Woman 03|Eternal Fire protect King Radovid!
Novigrad Old Woman 03|To buy or not to buy, that's the question…
Novigrad Old Woman 03|Sickly, you look to me.
Novigrad Old Woman 03|King Radovid is our ray of hope!
Novigrad Old Woman 03|Hope for a better tomorrow!
Novigrad Old Woman 03|Got you, thief!
Novigrad Old Woman 03|Those elves, they're as evil as those mages! Let them die, I say!

Novigrad Peasant 01|No use doin' any work in this rain.
Novigrad Peasant 01|Double levy to pay come spring, and that means…
Novigrad Peasant 01|Another storm's a-brewin'…
Novigrad Peasant 01|Rubbish of that sort's nothin' new.
Novigrad Peasant 01|But I wouldn't o' thought to find you spreadin' it!
Novigrad Peasant 01|Goin' to the fish market come morn?
Novigrad Peasant 01|Uuuuh, don't know.
Novigrad Peasant 01|Greetings.
Novigrad Peasant 01|Could use a dram of hooch.
Novigrad Peasant 01|What do you want?
Novigrad Peasant 01|White head like a miller's son!
Novigrad Peasant 01|Oy!
Novigrad Peasant 01|Bobbery!
Novigrad Peasant 01|Help! Good folk!
Novigrad Peasant 01|Deliver us from evil.
Novigrad Peasant 01|Starvation's pushed folk beyond the river to trade and eat human babies!
Novigrad Peasant 01|Can't be!
Novigrad Peasant 01|Bailiff's a harsh man, best not cause any trouble at the inn.
Novigrad Peasant 01|Why don't y'all just get off my back!
Novigrad Peasant 01|{*Slurp slurp*}
Novigrad Peasant 01|Thief!
Novigrad Peasant 01|We both know the Black Ones won't cross the Pontar - the pox's got 'em.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Peasant 02|Hope it rains like this come sowin' time.
Novigrad Peasant 02|Neighbors were so envious of that horse, and then…
Novigrad Peasant 02|King's messenger came by, took Shaggy, left the young'uns cryin'.
Novigrad Peasant 02|Aye, and pigs can fly!
Novigrad Peasant 02|What if we stop sowin' rye, try buckwheat instead?
Novigrad Peasant 02|Aye, that's a tough one. Lemme think…
Novigrad Peasant 02|Fire be praised!
Novigrad Peasant 02|Sow buckwheat and millet, they said. It'll pay off, they said.
Novigrad Peasant 02|Aaa, what?
Novigrad Peasant 02|Wouldn't be so pale if you ate onions in oil.
Novigrad Peasant 02|Oooy!
Novigrad Peasant 02|Please! Spare me!
Novigrad Peasant 02|Heeeeelp!
Novigrad Peasant 02|Hear me out.
Novigrad Peasant 02|Good sir?
Novigrad Peasant 02|You're a fierce one, but you've fairness in yer eyes.

Novigrad Peasant 03|So our boys nabbed 'er by the hair, dragged 'er to the guard post.
Novigrad Peasant 03|Heard that at the tavern?
Novigrad Peasant 03|Is it true peasant's gotta calve his cows hisself nowadays?
Novigrad Peasant 03|I just told ya.
Novigrad Peasant 03|Ah, welcome!
Novigrad Peasant 03|*Tsk* Got an itch 'neath my sack…
Novigrad Peasant 03|Kiss my arse!
Novigrad Peasant 03|Hide the wenches, witcher's comin'!
Novigrad Peasant 03|Sod off!
Novigrad Peasant 03|Run! Run away!
Novigrad Peasant 03|Have mercy on us.
Novigrad Peasant 03|You go your way, I'll go mine.
Novigrad Peasant 03|Had your fill of fool's parsley, have you?
Novigrad Peasant 03|Help! Thieves!
Novigrad Peasant 03|How'd you get a pass? Been beatin' me brain about it all day.

Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Achoo!
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Heard the miller's wife's millin' other men…
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|While the miller's away at market.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|What's this tripe you're sayin'?
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Takin' all your crop to the mill again after harvest?
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Already told you - no.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Mornin'!
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|All souls praise the Eternal Fire!
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Shave your mug.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|One glance tells me all I need to know about you.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Where you walkin'?!
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Save yourselves!
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|I don't want to dieeee!
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Hold us in your grace…
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Snots nowadays don't fly to the city, not interested in coin. They fly to fight for them Temerian guerillas.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Manly thing to do, they bloody say.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Unbelievable…
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Bugger off.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|No leadin' our lasses astray, scamp!
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|That reptile gaze o' yours don't scare me.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 01|Insolent knave! You thief!
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Peasant Woman 02|Just so it don't come down hard at harvest this year.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 02|Witch Hunters've been tellin' folk that any hag with a wart on her mug…
Novigrad Peasant Woman 02|…is a witch and she's to burn!
Novigrad Peasant Woman 02|You think it's true?
Novigrad Peasant Woman 02|Will you go to the chapel with me the night?
Novigrad Peasant Woman 02|Cor blimey…
Novigrad Peasant Woman 02|How's the gut feel today?
Novigrad Peasant Woman 02|All thumbs today…
Novigrad Peasant Woman 02|Yeeees?
Novigrad Peasant Woman 02|Won't let them boss you around, eh Whitehaired One?
Novigrad Peasant Woman 02|Oof!
Novigrad Peasant Woman 02|What's this?!
Novigrad Peasant Woman 02|Nooooooo!
Novigrad Peasant Woman 02|And may the harvest be bountiful, lest we starve to death…
Novigrad Peasant Woman 02|My man carries his pitchfork like you, on his back. I say you're both daft.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 02|What's it you need, boy?
Novigrad Peasant Woman 02|Stop the thief!
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|You like runnin' around, soaked to your bloomers?
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|How should I know?
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|Is it true she's whorin' around?
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|How many times will you ask me, for cock's sake?
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|Well met!
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|Fare ye well!
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|Shoo!
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|Stop starin' at the kids, you're scarin' 'em!
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|You drunk?
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|Wait! What was that?
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|Heeeeeeeelp!
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|What d'you want to do that for?
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|Eternal Fire!
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|Keep us in thy grace.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|Josef's pigs got hoof-and-mouth. Must be a curse!
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|You deaf?
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|Lingerin' like flies 'round shit, instead of doin' some honest work.
Novigrad Peasant Woman 03|Burglar, burglar!

Novigrad Poor Man 01|Raaaaaain, I like raaaaaaaain!
Novigrad Poor Man 01|Dyeworks'll only give you ringworm…
Novigrad Poor Man 01|Gouache leaves you toothless and hairless.
Novigrad Poor Man 01|What you on about now…?
Novigrad Poor Man 01|So? You in? Want the job?
Novigrad Poor Man 01|Course!
Novigrad Poor Man 01|Umblest greetin's.

Novigrad Poor Man 01|You call this livin', witcher?!
Novigrad Poor Man 01|Oi, man, this is Novigrad - no monsters to be 'ad!
Novigrad Poor Man 01|Aych!
Novigrad Poor Man 01|Guards!
Novigrad Poor Man 01|Gods…
Novigrad Poor Man 01|Ease me of doubt, of anguish, of fear…
Novigrad Poor Man 01|At's devilish dear!
Novigrad Poor Man 01|What's that I heard you done down in Blaviken?
Novigrad Poor Man 01|Waste of breath.
Novigrad Poor Man 01|If it ain't the White Wolf in… person?
Novigrad Poor Man 01|Yea! Heard about that, I did.
Novigrad Poor Man 01|They've growed fat on our misery! He's guttin' their pork bellies now!
Novigrad Poor Man 01|And pluckin' their eyes out 'cause they looked down on us simple folk!
Novigrad Poor Man 01|Guaaards!
Novigrad Poor Man 01|They're wrong to say you can only cut and slash. You're an able mummer.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Poor Man 02|And it's raining again.
Novigrad Poor Man 02|All was fine. Till she found out…
Novigrad Poor Man 02|…her mistress'd been secretly doin' magic!
Novigrad Poor Man 02|Should I tell the Temple Guard?
Novigrad Poor Man 02|That what now?
Novigrad Poor Man 02|Blimey!
Novigrad Poor Man 02|La li li li la…
Novigrad Poor Man 02|What do ya want?
Novigrad Poor Man 02|*Sighs* 'Nough said.

Novigrad Poor Man 02|Stop pretendin' you can't hear me! Knock the price down!
Novigrad Poor Man 02|Hit him!
Novigrad Poor Man 02|I'm busy.
Novigrad Poor Man 02|Long as the Black Ones're chasin' guerillas 'round the Kaedweni woods…
Novigrad Poor Man 02|Novigrad's safe.
Novigrad Poor Man 02|Help! Thieves!
Novigrad Poor Man 02|Hunters won't hassle you, witcher. But your average nonhuman can't do cock when they come.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Poor Man 03|A-a-achoo!
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Heard he's a vigilante, only kills bastards…
Novigrad Poor Man 03|…and whoresons who hurt folk.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Don't know what to believe anymore.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|That a witch murderin' folk at night?
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Looks that way.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Mornin'.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|How is everyone?
Novigrad Poor Man 03|You'd do well not to pester folk.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Eternal Fire burns, yet they's lettin' witchers into Novigrad?
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Where ya goin'?!
Novigrad Poor Man 03|No, please no…
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Enough to feed the tykes…
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Eh, if only me purse weren't empty.
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Oh! See that? That musta hurt!
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Menge's Guard - they're barmy. Burn you for just about anythin'!
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Can it get any worse…?
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Call the guards! Anybody!
Novigrad Poor Man 03|Eternal Fire protects us, it does. But if not for the witcher, Rejk'd still be huntin'.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Poor Woman 01|Akh akh akh akh!
Novigrad Poor Woman 01|The guards have got themselves a brothel in the dungeon…
Novigrad Poor Woman 01|…where they keep the witches…
Novigrad Poor Woman 01|Sweet mother of man…
Novigrad Poor Woman 01|You think they'd do it?
Novigrad Poor Woman 01|I think so.
Novigrad Poor Woman 01|Be praised!
Novigrad Poor Woman 01|Mum was right, should've stayed in the village…
Novigrad Poor Woman 01|What's that frown about?
Novigrad Poor Woman 01|Silver sword must be worth a lot!
Novigrad Poor Woman 01|Don't do it!
Novigrad Poor Woman 01|Oh, you don't mean to!
Novigrad Poor Woman 01|Good folk, help!
Novigrad Poor Woman 01|Deliver us from evil…
Novigrad Poor Woman 01|Just lookin', I was.
Novigrad Poor Woman 01|She's a country lass! Can't read, can't write.
Novigrad Poor Woman 01|No trade up 'er sleeve!
Novigrad Poor Woman 01|You surprised to hear she's sellin' her arse in that dwarven brothel?
Novigrad Poor Woman 01|Aye! I heard about that as well.
Novigrad Poor Woman 01|What?
Novigrad Poor Woman 01|What devil brings you here?
Novigrad Poor Woman 01|You're from beyond the river! Boors and rabble and onion-munchers!
Novigrad Poor Woman 01|Help! Thieves!
Novigrad Poor Woman 01|Your medallion's magic, ain't it? Could very well interest the hunters…
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|Must be mad runnin' around in this rain!
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|What's got into him, actin' so high an mighty?
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|Must be dealin' fisstech.
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|And how would you know?
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|Will you get those chancres cut at a barber's?
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|How should I know?
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|Eternal Fire be with you!
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|Yes, yes…
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|Yes, witcher?
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|No vampeers here in Novigrad. Eternal Fire protects us!
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|Don't push!
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|Aaaaah!
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|Most Hallowed Fire!
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|This all you got?
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|Mugger!
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|Take care, stay safe.
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|You must be filthy rich. Liftin' the spell off Temeria's princess…?
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|Guards! Guards!
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|The city coroner, was it? Ooo, good thing you dropped him…
Novigrad Poor Woman 02|Reverand Nathaniel, was it? Good thing you dropped him…
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Poor Woman 03|Hm, didn't look like rain…
Novigrad Poor Woman 03|Spends all her days in the chapel?
Novigrad Poor Woman 03|That whore who lifts her tail for all comers?!
Novigrad Poor Woman 03|Can you believe it?
Novigrad Poor Woman 03|If he's such a drunk, why don't you leave him?
Novigrad Poor Woman 03|Maybe?
Novigrad Poor Woman 03|Are you all right?
Novigrad Poor Woman 03|Morning, morning!
Novigrad Poor Woman 03|Were you born with those eyes?
Novigrad Poor Woman 03|Them Skelligers's whoresons, too! Attackin' any who go out to sea.
Novigrad Poor Woman 03|Get off!
Novigrad Poor Woman 03|Good folk - call the guards!
Novigrad Poor Woman 03|Please, no!
Novigrad Poor Woman 03|I praise you with all my heart!
Novigrad Poor Woman 03|Halve the price and I might buy something.
Novigrad Poor Woman 03|Yes?
Novigrad Poor Woman 03|Welcome.
Novigrad Poor Woman 03|You thief..!
Novigrad Poor Woman 03|Can't you see, good folk?! With Radovid in the city, the Black Ones are sure to lay seige!

Novigrad Prostitute 01|I'm sooooo hmmm…wet.
Novigrad Prostitute 01|So the girls want to go on strike!
Novigrad Prostitute 01|Truth be told the King's exactin' too much tribute these days.
Novigrad Prostitute 01|I don't care either way. Now stop tittle-tattling and get to work.
Novigrad Prostitute 01|D'you have to pay much? Was it worth takin' the tyke to that medic?
Novigrad Prostitute 01|Hard to say.
Novigrad Prostitute 01|Hmmm…
Novigrad Prostitute 01|Hey there, handsome!
Novigrad Prostitute 01|Meooooow?
Novigrad Prostitute 01|What's the hurry, my prince?
Novigrad Prostitute 01|Easy!
Novigrad Prostitute 01|Pff. Tryin' to impress me with that… sword?
Novigrad Prostitute 01|Don't kill me!
Novigrad Prostitute 01|Give me strength…
Novigrad Prostitute 01|…so she went to the herbalist for her mix, and while she was there, witch hunters burst in!
Novigrad Prostitute 01|Boys from the Guard say she'll be put to the fire with that granny.
Novigrad Prostitute 01|There's just no hope for her.
Novigrad Prostitute 01|Where'd you hear this?
Novigrad Prostitute 01|Ahh hahahahaha!
Novigrad Prostitute 01|Snake-eyes, got a snake's tongue as well?
Novigrad Prostitute 01|Looking for… something unusual?
Novigrad Prostitute 01|Thief!
Novigrad Prostitute 01|Redanian soldier boys are so tiresome… they want it all for free.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Prostitute 02|Long as the damp don't make me sick…
Novigrad Prostitute 02|Brave lads from the Guard are already on that butcher's trail.
Novigrad Prostitute 02|Oh, it'll be a sight. A pyre, most certain. And maybe they'll draw and quarter 'im as well?
Novigrad Prostitute 02|Heard that three times already. I'll not sit and hear it a fourth.
Novigrad Prostitute 02|Will you go to the baths with me? I'm feelin' filthy somehow…
Novigrad Prostitute 02|Absolutely.
Novigrad Prostitute 02|Hmm. Prrr.. Tee hee hee.
Novigrad Prostitute 02|We can go at it here, or at my place. You choose.
Novigrad Prostitute 02|Ah. I need a rest.
Novigrad Prostitute 02|You're a vulgar one - can see it in your face.
Novigrad Prostitute 02|Boor.
Novigrad Prostitute 02|Not so rough…
Novigrad Prostitute 02|Save me.
Novigrad Prostitute 02|Mitts to yourself.
Novigrad Prostitute 02|It's a material world. And I'm a material girl.
Novigrad Prostitute 02|Guards!
Novigrad Prostitute 02|I feel safer with you around, witcher.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Prostitute 03|Cost you double in the rain.
Novigrad Prostitute 03|That feast the hierarch threw - why, they had everything there!
Novigrad Prostitute 03|The best fisstech, girls from all round town, a family of midgets, and even a striped horse from lands across the sea!
Novigrad Prostitute 03|Rubbish.
Novigrad Prostitute 03|Think it could be the clap?
Novigrad Prostitute 03|Can't be bothered right now…
Novigrad Prostitute 03|Hey, darlin'. Like what you see?
Novigrad Prostitute 03|Hey, handsome!
Novigrad Prostitute 03|Prrrrr…
Novigrad Prostitute 03|You'll look fuckin' amazin'. On top of me.
Novigrad Prostitute 03|You'd normally pay for that!
Novigrad Prostitute 03|Guards!
Novigrad Prostitute 03|Ha-aw ekh ekh…
Novigrad Prostitute 03|You always wear tight trousers?
Novigrad Prostitute 03|Wanna bite me, wolfie?
Novigrad Prostitute 03|Wanna dip your dingle?
Novigrad Prostitute 03|This life, sometimes it's a handful…
Novigrad Prostitute 03|Help! Thief!
Novigrad Prostitute 03|Geraaaalt, positively divine performance, you make a splendid mummer!
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Refugee Man 01|Ehh…
Novigrad Refugee Man 01|Whoreson rode about, helpin', he said, givin' food to the hungry…
Novigrad Refugee Man 01|But the vittles were pox-ridden! Ehh… Whether by sword or plague, they's always killin' peasants…
Novigrad Refugee Man 01|Gods…
Novigrad Refugee Man 01|Long live a free Temeria.
Novigrad Refugee Man 01|Traitor.

Novigrad Refugee Man 01|Watch it.
Novigrad Refugee Man 01|Don't hurt me! Aaaaah!
Novigrad Refugee Man 01|Good health to you.
Novigrad Refugee Man 01|Save yourselves!

Novigrad Refugee Man 02|Not that… Not again… Please…
Novigrad Refugee Man 02|No, no, no, noooo!
Novigrad Refugee Man 02|That hurt.
Novigrad Refugee Man 02|Vernon Roche already vexes the Black Ones… Got 'em scared shitless.
Novigrad Refugee Man 02|All Temeria's abuzz about it.
Novigrad Refugee Man 02|A black Temeria's no Temeria at all.
Novigrad Refugee Man 02|Shoulda stayed in the motherland, 'stead o' fleein' to foreign parts…
Novigrad Refugee Man 02|Greetings.
Novigrad Refugee Man 02|Radovid a bringer of freedom? Just another invader, as I see it, witcher.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Refugee Man 03|My regards.
Novigrad Refugee Man 03|Any news from Temeria, traveler?
Novigrad Refugee Man 03|Mhm?
Novigrad Refugee Man 03|Even the rain smells different here.
Novigrad Refugee Man 03|Stop, please…
Novigrad Refugee Man 03|Down with war! Down with violence!
Novigrad Refugee Man 03|Help!
Novigrad Refugee Man 03|What's this?!
Novigrad Refugee Man 03|All of 'em! They looted all Vizima's treasures! Gold, jewels, paintings, candlesticks…
Novigrad Refugee Man 03|They fattened themselves on our capital, oh yes, ate their fill… Invaders.
Novigrad Refugee Man 03|Naught for work, naught to eat.
Novigrad Refugee Man 03|What woe it is to wander foreign lands…
Novigrad Refugee Man 03|May tomorrow be better than yesterday.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Refugee Man 04|May fortune treat us with kindness.
Novigrad Refugee Man 04|Who the devil's this?
Novigrad Refugee Man 04|What'll become of us…?
Novigrad Refugee Man 04|Oh, aye. Rain. Perfect.
Novigrad Refugee Man 04|Oh dearie…
Novigrad Refugee Man 04|Gonna be killin'!
Novigrad Refugee Man 04|Cheeky bastard!
Novigrad Refugee Man 04|Wait, wait… Griffin? White Orchard? Ring a bell?
Novigrad Refugee Man 04|Monsters breed well in wartime, do they?
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Refugee Woman 01|Good health to you.
Novigrad Refugee Woman 01|What?
Novigrad Refugee Woman 01|You a deserter?
Novigrad Refugee Woman 01|Blast it all, it's pourin'.
Novigrad Refugee Woman 01|Don't rightly know… Maybe it's true, and maybe it ain't?
Novigrad Refugee Woman 01|Please, sir, don't hurt me…
Novigrad Refugee Woman 01|Aaaah! Aaaah!
Novigrad Refugee Woman 01|Watch how you walk!
Novigrad Refugee Woman 01|Surrounded 'em at the ford. Me brother managed to cross, but o' those left, the Black Ones hanged all the men…
Novigrad Refugee Woman 01|And the women, gods… All the women, they…
Novigrad Refugee Woman 01|Why'd exile have to be our lot?
Novigrad Refugee Woman 01|No roof over me head, coin's about run out…
Novigrad Refugee Woman 01|Greetings.
Novigrad Refugee Woman 01|Radovid is in Novigrad. Vizima will be ours again tomorrow.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Refugee Woman 02|Good day, good day.
Novigrad Refugee Woman 02|What're you doin'?
Novigrad Refugee Woman 02|Go bother someone else.
Novigrad Refugee Woman 02|I don't want to hear it!
Novigrad Refugee Woman 02|Where's the guards?! Guards!
Novigrad Refugee Woman 02|Heeeeelp!
Novigrad Refugee Woman 02|Oaf.
Novigrad Refugee Woman 02|They've these special units that do naught but travel from village to village, murderin' folk…
Novigrad Refugee Woman 02|Tis extermination, the extermination of the Temerian nation. And the world watches and does nothin'!
Novigrad Refugee Woman 02|Just hope my man finds some work…
Novigrad Refugee Woman 02|How's a body live amidst such crowds, noise, stench…?
Novigrad Refugee Woman 02|Good day.
Novigrad Refugee Woman 02|Let the witches burn, I say! Damned war's their fault!
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Refugee Woman 03|Greetings.
Novigrad Refugee Woman 03|Don't scare me young'uns.
Novigrad Refugee Woman 03|What?
Novigrad Refugee Woman 03|Children! Gather 'round!
Novigrad Refugee Woman 03|I heard that, too!
Novigrad Refugee Woman 03|Oh no.
Novigrad Refugee Woman 03|Where're my young'uns?! Aaargh!
Novigrad Refugee Woman 03|Eh, swine.
Novigrad Refugee Woman 03|And Vizima… Vizima they're to raze!
Novigrad Refugee Woman 03|Then plant cabbage where our capital now stands…
Novigrad Refugee Woman 03|Black Ones took Vizima, they'll take Novigrad, too.
Novigrad Refugee Woman 03|Once Nilfgaard arrives here, where'll we flee to?
Novigrad Refugee Woman 03|My regards!
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Refugee Woman 04|Leave me alone.
Novigrad Refugee Woman 04|Pfff.
Novigrad Refugee Woman 04|Get stuffed.
Novigrad Refugee Woman 04|I've had enough.
Novigrad Refugee Woman 04|Gods!
Novigrad Refugee Woman 04|We'll all die!
Novigrad Refugee Woman 04|Sod off!
Novigrad Refugee Woman 04|Come to bask in our misfortune?
Novigrad Refugee Woman 04|I know you! You're the one killed King Foltest!
Novigrad Refugee Woman 04|I hate every last one of you.

Novigrad Rich Man 01|This will pass.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|They say the income tax for trading companies is to rise.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Just like that!
Novigrad Rich Man 01|You don't believe that yourself, do you?
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Will we receive any restitution for our investments in Temeria, now lost?
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Oh, I don't think so.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Good day.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Greetings. *Yaaaaaaawn*
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Well I'll be! A true albino.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Captured and displayed in in the sideshow of a circus…
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Well, it could be quite profitable…
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Watch it.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Hmm?
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Oh, Mother Creatrix!
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Guards, guards!
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Holy Fire!
Novigrad Rich Man 01|One heart, one faith, one Fire Eternal.
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Any chance you'll tell me where you got your goods?
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Peasants beating one another…
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Well, well…
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Is there a land where I might find more of your kind?
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Did you hear the juicy bit from the last race day at the Vegelbuds?
Novigrad Rich Man 01|The Koviri legate wagered a whole bundle of villages! And he lost!
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Hah!
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Thieves!
Novigrad Rich Man 01|Radovid's first decree? Raises taxes, of course. War is a costly business.
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Rich Man 02|For some this might be a chance to bathe.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|What next? Discretionary tribute to benefit Redania or…
Novigrad Rich Man 02|*gasp* …exile?!
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Rumors, rumors, rumors.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|How much did they sell the magnificent property for?
Novigrad Rich Man 02|We've spoken of this already.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|How is business?
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Bene.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Simpleton.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|I expect model behavior, scamp.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Don't touch me!
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Noooo!
Novigrad Rich Man 02|*Snort* You jest.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Watch over me.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Might I have a look?
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Watch it!
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Stay away.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Novigrad, capital of the world. Yet they let such rabble in.
Novigrad Rich Man 02|Temple Guard! Somebody call the Guard!
Novigrad Rich Man 02|There, there - another exmple of Redanian order…
<|endoftext|>
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Rain makes this city even more dreary.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|He's a nobody, a yokel who crawled out of a hole!
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Had some luck at the races, now he thinks he's nobility!
Novigrad Rich Man 03|I trust this information is solid?
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Will you make it to the Vegelbuds' this week?
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Most probably.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Humblest greetings.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Greetings to you, sir.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Don't bother me, please.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Truth is we're already dependent on the Black Ones. Economically.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Pardon me.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Are you mad? Had your fill of hemlock?
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Aaaah!
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Eternal Fire protect us!
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Allow me, sirrah, to peruse your wares.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Gentlemen! Gentlemen…

Novigrad Rich Man 03|The second sword - is it in case the first one breaks?
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Smart.
Novigrad Rich Man 03|Hoah! What do you think you're doing?!

Novigrad Rich Woman 01|Ahh…
Novigrad Rich Woman 01|The Temple Guards refuse even to look for the murderer. Why?
Novigrad Rich Woman 01|They've orders to chase only witches!
Novigrad Rich Woman 01|We might have expected as much.
Novigrad Rich Woman 01|You think it a good idea - not to pay Cleaver now?
Novigrad Rich Woman 01|Honestly? I don't know.
Novigrad Rich Woman 01|How do you feel?
Novigrad Rich Woman 01|My regards to your mother!
Novigrad Rich Woman 01|Unbelievable, a witcher in Novigrad. What will the priests say?
Novigrad Rich Woman 01|Yes, master?
Novigrad Rich Woman 01|Slow down!
Novigrad Rich Woman 01|Do you have any idea who I am?!
Novigrad Rich Woman 01|I beg you, help!
Novigrad Rich Woman 01|My husband, that he return to me unharmed…
Novigrad Rich Woman 01|Hmmm, I don't know…
Novigrad Rich Woman 01|They wanted to imprison master Dandelion! The nerve!
Novigrad Rich Woman 01|Really?
Novigrad Rich Woman 01|Yes?
Novigrad Rich Woman 01|Oo la la!
Novigrad Rich Woman 01|Arrogant whoreson! Thief!

Novigrad Rich Woman 02|What is with this weather?
Novigrad Rich Woman 02|They say he took a mound of coin for helping catch that sorcerer.
Novigrad Rich Woman 02|The one he revealed to the Temple Guard.
Novigrad Rich Woman 02|Hmm, are you certain?
Novigrad Rich Woman 02|Do you think the hierarch supports the Temerian guerillas? With coin?
Novigrad Rich Woman 02|I doubt it.
Novigrad Rich Woman 02|What's the rush?
Novigrad Rich Woman 02|Fare thee well.
Novigrad Rich Woman 02|Mutant.
Novigrad Rich Woman 02|They're letting in vagrants from Velen? Why does the Temple Guard man the gates at all?
Novigrad Rich Woman 02|Arrogant bastard!
Novigrad Rich Woman 02|The impertinence!
Novigrad Rich Woman 02|Auuuu!
Novigrad Rich Woman 02|And if some damage could come to the neighbors' carriage…
Novigrad Rich Woman 02|Reduce your prices, then perhaps I'll purchase something.
Novigrad Rich Woman 02|Eternal Fire…
Novigrad Rich Woman 02|Don't you fear the pyre, freak?
Novigrad Rich Woman 02|You have some nerve, thief. Guards!

Novigrad Rich Woman 03|Ah, I love the air after a good rain.
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|Cleaver has raised his prices again!
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|He even bribed the Temple Guard to collect his protection coin for him.
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|Now I've seen it all.
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|I suppose there is no more hope for the accused sorceress?
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|I cannot tell you now.
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|Pff.
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|Yes, yes.
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|Do not, I repeat, do not come any closer.
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|I read one look is all it takes to get scabs.
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|How dare you?!
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|Guards!
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|Oh no! Noooo!
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|Eternal Fire light up my life… Oh, I meant…
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|This was cheaper at the other stall!
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|Are you still here?
Novigrad Rich Woman 03|A witcher… Eternal Fire have mercy.

Olgierd|Time to die, witcher!
Olgierd|You fight well, Geralt.
Olgierd|I've long not faced a foe so fierce.
Olgierd|Bravo, Geralt! You force me to strive!
Olgierd|Ptooey. Time to fight, Geralt. May the better man win.

Redanian Blacksmith 01|Hey there. *Sniff*
Redanian Blacksmith 01|What's new?
Redanian Blacksmith 01|If you can't stand the heat, get outta the forge.

Redanian Blacksmith 01|Looking for a hammering?
Redanian Blacksmith 01|Now what? Am I to call for help?
Redanian Blacksmith 01|Help! Save me!

Redanian Noble 01|It shan't continue long.
Redanian Noble 01|And yet the count, that parvenu swine - *spits* - managed to save his neck!
Redanian Noble 01|That's extraordinarily interesting.
Redanian Noble 01|Might I interest you in a chess match?
Redanian Noble 01|Absolutely.
Redanian Noble 01|Why, greetings, greetings.
Redanian Noble 01|Splendid weather we're having.
Redanian Noble 01|Yeees?
Redanian Noble 01|Have we not met before, in Loc Muinne, perchance?
Redanian Noble 01|Beg your pardon!
Redanian Noble 01|What's the meaning of this…?
Redanian Noble 01|Help!
Redanian Noble 01|Eternal Fire…
Redanian Noble 01|Your wares lack luster, stall keeper.
Redanian Noble 01|That's not all! Rumor has it the count's returned and now wreaks havoc in Novigrad.
Redanian Noble 01|You don't say? I wouldn't be so quick to believe.
Redanian Noble 01|Well, well. A witcher.
Redanian Noble 01|The famed Geralt of Rivia, I presume?
Redanian Noble 01|Akh.
Redanian Noble 01|Outrageous! A thief!
<|endoftext|>
Redanian Noble 02|It's damp, it's damp…
Redanian Noble 02|It's raining, of course it's going to be damp!
Redanian Noble 02|If he's back in His Royal Majesty's good graces…
Redanian Noble 02|Does this also mean his corpulent arse will once again grace the advisor's chair?
Redanian Noble 02|Allow me not to comment on this scandal-mongering.
Redanian Noble 02|And do you believe Radovid will stop at that?
Redanian Noble 02|Why ever not?
Redanian Noble 02|My sincerest regards.
Redanian Noble 02|Long live the king.
Redanian Noble 02|Mhm?
Redanian Noble 02|The mark of a dangerous guild you wear.
Redanian Noble 02|What's this?!
Redanian Noble 02|Assailant!
Redanian Noble 02|Nooooo!
Redanian Noble 02|Eternal Fire, grant me strength.
Redanian Noble 02|Try not to disturb me.
Redanian Noble 02|His Majesty King Radovid is a stern ruler, but a just one.
Redanian Noble 02|Help! Robber!

Redanian Officer 01|Your ploughing duty's to defend your motherland, kill your motherland's enemies, die for your motherland…
Redanian Officer 01|And soak in the fucking rain for your motherland!

Redanian Officer 01|Watch out! Witchcraft!
Redanian Officer 01|Avenge your comrade!
Redanian Officer 01|Witchers, good folk, are like necrophages.
Redanian Officer 01|Vile in appearance and reeking of dead men's bile, it's rotting flesh they truly crave.
Redanian Officer 01|To kill one or the other is a service to mankind.
Redanian Officer 01|I don't think you know what you're doing.
Redanian Officer 01|Hoo-ah!
Redanian Officer 01|Ooh, that's it!

Redanian Soldier 01|Oooaaa…
Redanian Soldier 01|Word around camp's that he'll lose his head if it goes to a tribunal.
Redanian Soldier 01|Folk say all sorts of things, needn't believe it all.
Redanian Soldier 01|Think Nilfgaard'll brave an assault?
Redanian Soldier 01|Who knows, who knows.
Redanian Soldier 01|Redania!
Redanian Soldier 01|Sod off, before I lose me patience.

Redanian Soldier 01|He's a quick devil!
Redanian Soldier 01|Whoreson's a witchman!
Redanian Soldier 01|No!
Redanian Soldier 01|Know why they're threatening him with a tribunal?
Redanian Soldier 01|They say he lined some prisoners up against a wall, had at 'em with a crossbow.
Redanian Soldier 01|Doesn't surprise me a bit.
Redanian Soldier 01|Gonna puree your bowels.
Redanian Soldier 01|For Radovid!
Redanian Soldier 01|Aw, they've chased the students out, so the whores've buggered off, too.
Redanian Soldier 01|Zzzz… huh? What the fuck?
Redanian Soldier 01|Hey! Bloody hell!
Redanian Soldier 01|And with that, you're fucked.
<|endoftext|>
Redanian Soldier 02|Lovely weather. For sittin' in the barracks.
Redanian Soldier 02|But to threaten one of our own with the noose 'cause he killed a few Nilfgaard prisoners?
Redanian Soldier 02|If they gave me a stripe for every piece o' tripe I hear…
Redanian Soldier 02|I'd be a general by now.
Redanian Soldier 02|Drinkin' in the barracks tomorrow, or do we crash the inn?
Redanian Soldier 02|You asked that already!
Redanian Soldier 02|Hail!

Redanian Townsman 01|*Sigh* Lovely.
Redanian Townsman 01|Witch hunters took his wife because she was a midwife…
Redanian Townsman 01|… but she had droves of herbs and ointments, like a true witch.
Redanian Townsman 01|*Sigh* World these days…
Redanian Townsman 01|They claim she's got a black cat? But what if she's innocent?
Redanian Townsman 01|I'll have to think about that.
Redanian Townsman 01|Good day.
Redanian Townsman 01|Good day to you, sir.
Redanian Townsman 01|Yes?
Redanian Townsman 01|What's an oddity like that doing here?
Redanian Townsman 01|You needn't shove!

Redanian Townsman 01|Heeeelp!
Redanian Townsman 01|Eternal Fire, protect us from all evil.
Redanian Townsman 01|Lower your price and I'll consider it.
Redanian Townsman 01|The drill at the Temerian camp's bad, worse than at Drakenborg!
Redanian Townsman 01|March 'em so hard, they end up carrying half out feet forward!
Redanian Townsman 01|I'm speechless.
Redanian Townsman 01|Hullo.
Redanian Townsman 01|You do know there're witch hunters in the city?
Redanian Townsman 01|Witcher.
Redanian Townsman 01|Hey! What're you doing there?!
<|endoftext|>
Redanian Townsman 02|Achoo!
Redanian Townsman 02|Heathen dwarves in Novigrad have molded a golem out of Pontar mud…
Redanian Townsman 02|…At night it hunts those who believe in the Eternal Fire, breaks their necks!
Redanian Townsman 02|I want to believe you made that up…
Redanian Townsman 02|See you at the pub tonight?
Redanian Townsman 02|I don't know…
Redanian Townsman 02|Eternal Fire light your path!
Redanian Townsman 02|Where're you rushing off to?
Redanian Townsman 02|I won't talk with you.
Redanian Townsman 02|Just you wait, the witch hunters'll see to you!
Redanian Townsman 02|Why?!
Redanian Townsman 02|Sword, he's got a sword!
Redanian Townsman 02|Have mercy!
Redanian Townsman 02|Faith, hope, the Eternal Fire…
Redanian Townsman 02|Out of here!
Redanian Townsman 02|Cat eyes… Mark o' the devil.

Redanian Townsman 03|What a downpour…
Redanian Townsman 03|Elves stole her kid and sold it to a witch!
Redanian Townsman 03|Really?!
Redanian Townsman 03|Perhaps I should enlist?
Redanian Townsman 03|We'll discuss it later.
Redanian Townsman 03|G'day!
Redanian Townsman 03|All the best.
Redanian Townsman 03|Oh. The White Wolf.
Redanian Townsman 03|Such excellence, my, my.

Redanian Townsman 03|And may the old coot bite the dust - after he's written me into his will!
Redanian Townsman 03|My goodness!
Redanian Townsman 03|Know what they say about you lot? If you seek justice, hire a witcher!
Redanian Townsman 03|Those were the days… A tavern, a brothel at every corner… Student lasses shakin' their lovely little arses…
Redanian Townsman 03|I saw that! You robbed me!
<|endoftext|>
Redanian Townsman 04|Tam ta ram tam tam tam.
Redanian Townsman 04|Wanderers and vagrants by the dozen in Redania now. Know why?
Redanian Townsman 04|Some cheat on the Temerian side's selling counterfeit passes!
Redanian Townsman 04|Unbelievable!
Redanian Townsman 04|Think I'd be any good at tracking down witches?
Redanian Townsman 04|I think so.
Redanian Townsman 04|How are things faring?
Redanian Townsman 04|Good to see you!
Redanian Townsman 04|Have a nice day.
Redanian Townsman 04|Viva Radovid!
Redanian Townsman 04|Ah, forgive me.
Redanian Townsman 04|Desist, let me live, sir!
Redanian Townsman 04|Help!
Redanian Townsman 04|Eternal Fire…
Redanian Townsman 04|Do we know each other?
Redanian Townsman 04|That Nilfgaardian imperror can kiss my arse.
Redanian Townsman 04|Take your paws off my things!

Redanian Townswoman 01|Maybe it's true what they say? The witches prepare a deluge?
Redanian Townswoman 01|Once she'd been shaved, they began to dunk her. They say that's when she summoned demons!
Redanian Townswoman 01|And the one hunter she touched got the mange and died three days after!
Redanian Townswoman 01|Where'd you hear that?
Redanian Townswoman 01|Can you look after my daughter tomorrow?
Redanian Townswoman 01|Hrmm…
Redanian Townswoman 01|Greetings.
Redanian Townswoman 01|Go in health!

Redanian Townswoman 01|Nooooo!
Redanian Townswoman 01|Most Hallowed Fire, which illuminates our path through life…
Redanian Townswoman 01|What else, with her husband dead? She works the streets!
Redanian Townswoman 01|You don't say…
Redanian Townswoman 01|What is it?
Redanian Townswoman 01|Are you a witcher?
Redanian Townswoman 01|The witch hunters defend us from monsters.
Redanian Townswoman 01|Now where did you haul these goods in from, eh?
Redanian Townswoman 01|Thieeeeeef!
<|endoftext|>
Redanian Townswoman 02|Rats!
Redanian Townswoman 02|No decent woman coaxes men by danglin' her tits.
Redanian Townswoman 02|They say she's either a harlot or a witch.
Redanian Townswoman 02|It's true, I heard the same!
Redanian Townswoman 02|So will you visit your mum after all?
Redanian Townswoman 02|Sorry?
Redanian Townswoman 02|Greetings!
Redanian Townswoman 02|All praise the Eternal Fire!
Redanian Townswoman 02|Good day.
Redanian Townswoman 02|The knight from the fairytales, did he have white hair or a white horse?
Redanian Townswoman 02|Beg your pardon!
Redanian Townswoman 02|Mercy! Spare me!
Redanian Townswoman 02|Eternal Fire, save me!
Redanian Townswoman 02|Our hope lies in the Eternal Fire!
Redanian Townswoman 02|Beware the witch hunters.

Skellige Armorer 01|Eh?
Skellige Armorer 01|Help! Good folk!
Skellige Armorer 01|What is it?
Skellige Armorer 01|And a sword cross his back 'stead of an oar…
Skellige Armorer 01|Half a jug of busthead in one gulp! He was that terrified!
Skellige Armorer 01|But he'd looked a griffin in the eyes and lived… So I'm not surprised.

Skellige Druid 01|Mhm…
Skellige Druid 01|Ehh… 'Twas Crach told his son to kill the Giant *pant pant*. Screamed at him *pant pant* not to come home without the beast's head.
Skellige Druid 01|Hmph. It's simply not fitting to repeat such rubbish at your age.

Skellige Druid 02|The very reason Udalryk's slowly losing his mind.
Skellige Druid 02|Hm, could be true…
Skellige Druid 02|And 'twere the Wraiths of Mörhogg that razed the village, is that so?

Skellige Druid 02|By Hemdall…
Skellige Druid 02|Grant me strength and wisdom, ye gods.
Skellige Druid 02|Mhm?

Skellige Druid 03|All right, I'll take your word for it.
Skellige Druid 03|Perchance a tea of zireael extract would help her?
Skellige Druid 03|Hemdall only knows.
Skellige Druid 03|Greetings.
Skellige Druid 03|Akh akh akh akh.
Skellige Druid 03|*Heavy breathing* Ech.

Skellige Druid 03|I beg you, Modron, stop pestering me with this confounded cough.
Skellige Druid 03|You look unwell. *Cough cough*
Skellige Druid 03|Haven't seen a Continental here *cough cough* in a long while.
Skellige Druid 03|Well, well, Geralt the Ice Giant Killer!
Skellige Druid 03|You might've let the giant live? He could've defeated the Nilfgaardians single-handed…
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Druid 04|Modron Freya weeps…
Skellige Druid 04|My brother studied that legend. And I tell you, there's more than a grain of truth in it.
Skellige Druid 04|He even encountered a few, all teeth and claws and covered in fur… Half-men, half-bears!
Skellige Druid 04|Do I look like one who'd believe such drivel? Don't insult my intelligence.
Skellige Druid 04|The cursed wood, Morkvarg… Modron Freya scourges the land for we’ve faltered in our faith in the gods!
Skellige Druid 04|I feel we've spoken of this before.
Skellige Druid 04|Praise to the bravest of the brave!
Skellige Druid 04|Seek solace in the Holy Oak's shadow!
Skellige Druid 04|Ugh. A witcher.
Skellige Druid 04|Nomadic slayer of beasts and monsters.
Skellige Druid 04|Watch your step!
Skellige Druid 04|Disturb not the forces of nature!
Skellige Druid 04|Gods!
Skellige Druid 04|O Freya, swaddle all living creatures in your protective embrace.
Skellige Druid 04|I shan't parley with you.
Skellige Druid 04|Pleased with yourself, murderer?
Skellige Druid 04|Don't you think I'll fall at your feet just because you killed a giant.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Druid 05|Pff.
Skellige Druid 05|He said: "How's that? You would strangle me with rope?" And he wrenched the guard's sword away from him…
Skellige Druid 05|And plunged it into his own gut to the hilt! A Black One, aye, but a man of honor.
Skellige Druid 05|What kind of half-baked tale is that…?
Skellige Druid 05|And they wish to try him? To summon the Ting? All because he dared brandish his axe?
Skellige Druid 05|Can't be bothered at the moment.
Skellige Druid 05|Aye?
Skellige Druid 05|You look wearied, Whitehair.
Skellige Druid 05|Watch it!
Skellige Druid 05|A splendid weapon.
Skellige Druid 05|No, no! Nooooo!
Skellige Druid 05|I shall name evil wherever I find it, and grant our foes no rest.
Skellige Druid 05|The glory you attain shall never perish.
Skellige Druid 05|To battle shoulder to shoulder with a witcher!
Skellige Druid 05|What times! The Black Ones gettin' us, 'stead of us getting' them… Ehh.
Skellige Druid 05|We've got a queen ruling us - and I hear 'twas your doing, Geralt.
Skellige Druid 05|For a son to inherit what was his father's - 'tis proper, 'tis right! Hail Svanrige!

Skellige Fisherman 04|The Witcher of Rivia, welcome to Skellige!
Skellige Fisherman 04|Control yourself, man.
Skellige Fisherman 04|Hm?
Skellige Fisherman 04|Why so testy?
Skellige Fisherman 04|Got a sea beast about that they summoned a witcher?
Skellige Fisherman 04|Wonder where types like that come from?
Skellige Fisherman 04|Someone Crach summoned?
Skellige Fisherman 04|Mind yer own arse.
Skellige Fisherman 04|Jarl's guests are our guests.
Skellige Fisherman 04|Want a fish?
Skellige Fisherman 04|Akh akh akh.
Skellige Fisherman 04|King Bran? Why, a traitor the Black Ones bought poisoned 'im! That's fact!
Skellige Fisherman 04|Can't be!
Skellige Fisherman 04|Think the druids speak true?
Skellige Fisherman 04|Wild Hunt only knows.
Skellige Fisherman 04|Mercy!
Skellige Fisherman 04|Gods, don't ye take my strength.
Skellige Fisherman 04|I'd been tellin' Donar to get a witcher on that werewolf for ages. And? Was right, wasn't I?
Skellige Fisherman 04|Felt it comin' a while now! They poisoned King Bran first, now their whole fleet's upon us!
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Fisherman 05|Oh, this again.
Skellige Fisherman 05|Crach's son Hjalmar, his head's melted! He sailed off to kill the Ice Giant!
Skellige Fisherman 05|How d'you know that's true?
Skellige Fisherman 05|You believe that? Cursed trees and flyin' phantoms?
Skellige Fisherman 05|You takin' the piss?
Skellige Fisherman 05|Ahoy?

Skellige Fisherman 05|Godless defiler, begone!
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Fisherman 06|Oh no. We're in for it.
Skellige Fisherman 06|A drinkin' contest, aye, first to fall 'neath the table. So who wins? A druid!
Skellige Fisherman 06|Thing is, he cheated - swapped in a sea goat horn!
Skellige Fisherman 06|You're dreadful dull.
Skellige Fisherman 06|Say the new king ups the levy - that mean I gotta give 'im bigger fish?

Skellige Fisherman 06|So say the queen ups the levy - that mean I gotta give 'er bigger fish?
Skellige Fisherman 06|Hemdall's balls! 'Twas you Gremist took for an apprentice?!
Skellige Fisherman 06|So, 'tweren't the gods spoke to Udalryk, just some phantom torturin' 'im?

Skellige Girl 03|Watch it!
Skellige Girl 03|Jeepers, you a wraith from Mörhogg?
Skellige Girl 03|No! *Sob sob*
Skellige Girl 03|You're not that scary!
Skellige Girl 03|Uncle said folk on the Continent got heads like cats.
Skellige Girl 03|But you only got cat eyes.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Guard 01|These continental dandies come a-struttin', then we gotta drag their corpses outta the inn.
Skellige Guard 01|Just don't go pesterin' folk.
Skellige Guard 01|Hide that 'fore you hurt yourself.
Skellige Guard 01|Rain or shine - here to serve.
Skellige Guard 01|They'd sawed through his ribs, were about to rip his lung out… Then they twigged they'd no salt for the wound!
Skellige Guard 01|So one went searchin', and that's when the bird flew the coop! Keen watch they kept!
Skellige Guard 01|Fine tale you dreamt up…
Skellige Guard 01|Believe that claptrap about Bran?
Skellige Guard 01|Pfff…
Skellige Guard 01|Praised be the bravest!
Skellige Guard 01|Hael.

Skellige Guard 01|You'll regret yer mum weren't barren!
Skellige Guard 01|Peace, mate.
Skellige Guard 01|Adventure seeker?
Skellige Guard 01|Blackhand's haul in loot was so ample they had to toss some into the sea!
Skellige Guard 01|Weren't enough room in the longboat!
Skellige Guard 01|Got one word: bollocks.
Skellige Guard 01|We need every sword-arm we can get! Nilfgaard's at the gates.
Skellige Guard 01|So Folan were eaten by trolls! Neverendin' shame, that, dyin' as chowder!
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Guard 02|Them supper knives're good for pickin' your teeth, sure. An axe - there's a weapon.
Skellige Guard 02|Best not get in the way of me axe.
Skellige Guard 02|Stop wavin' that around, you'll scare folk.
Skellige Guard 02|Hope it k-keeps to a drizzle.
Skellige Guard 02|One of our lads tried to kill that whoreson Morkvarg.
Skellige Guard 02|Monster but looked at 'im, and our hero fled so fast he lost his cacks!
Skellige Guard 02|Good one.

Skellige Guard 03|Who's this?
Skellige Guard 03|Stay outta trouble, or you'll answer to me.
Skellige Guard 03|Kaer Trolde ain't the continent, put it away.
Skellige Guard 03|This here's Skellige. We don't run 'round town with our sword hangin' out!
Skellige Guard 03|Got a hankerin' for mischief? Put that away.
Skellige Guard 03|Oughta keep an eye on him.
Skellige Guard 03|I'd advise ye not to look for trouble. 'Cause you'll find me.
Skellige Guard 03|Watch who you cross.
Skellige Guard 03|Akh akh!
Skellige Guard 03|Lucky the sooths saw to the cursed wood.
Skellige Guard 03|Thicket was swallowin' folk. Whosoever ventured in never returned!

Skellige Guard 03|All healed, wounds licked? You better now?
Skellige Guard 03|Hmmm… I think so.
Skellige Guard 03|How'd you do.
Skellige Guard 03|How're things?
Skellige Guard 03|Hey you!

<|endoftext|>
Skellige Guard 05|Yaaaaawn…

Skellige Guard 05|You're too eager to believe.
Skellige Guard 05|Hahaha, think our young beau'll set off on another adventure?
Skellige Guard 05|You bleat on and on like an old ewe.
Skellige Guard 05|Get back to your affairs.

<|endoftext|>
Skellige Guard 06|Me boots're fuckin' soaked.

Skellige Guard 06|Leave it be, me head's fuckin' poundin'…
Skellige Guard 06|You believe the wood's cursed?
Skellige Guard 06|Naaaye…
Skellige Guard 06|Move along, move along.
Skellige Guard 06|*Yawn* I am tuckered.
Skellige Guard 06|What is it?
Skellige Guard 06|Watch yourself, Whitehair.
Skellige Guard 06|Watch where ye step!
Skellige Guard 06|Now slide it back in the scabbard.
Skellige Guard 06|Mercy! Spare me life!
Skellige Guard 06|I promise you a quick death.
Skellige Guard 06|You're fucked.
Skellige Guard 06|Don't let 'im get away!
Skellige Guard 06|I want 'im alive!
Skellige Guard 06|Cover your eyes!
Skellige Guard 06|C'mon! At 'im!
Skellige Guard 06|Mörhogg devour ye!
Skellige Guard 06|Die!
Skellige Guard 06|Will you keep loiterin', botherin' folk?
Skellige Guard 06|Heed our ways, drifter.
Skellige Guard 06|Till Hjalmar split its massive skull,
Skellige Guard 06|Rid the isles of this fearsome foe.
Skellige Guard 06|Nilfgaard in Skellige… Never fuckin' thought I'd see the day…
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Hunter 01|Eh?
Skellige Hunter 01|Hm?
Skellige Hunter 01|Seekin' somethin'?
Skellige Hunter 01|Don't like foreign folk 'round here.
Skellige Hunter 01|But you ain't a foreigner no more, Geralt.
Skellige Hunter 01|Huh?
Skellige Hunter 01|Run!
Skellige Hunter 01|Leg it!
Skellige Hunter 01|Flee!
Skellige Hunter 01|It'll stomp the gras down, cover all tracks.
Skellige Hunter 01|…trees deformed, game killed! The curse of Mörhogg's wraiths…
Skellige Hunter 01|Suppose you've seen the White Whale, too, eh?
Skellige Hunter 01|Wouldn't fancy headin' out with me, would ye? On a hunt?
Skellige Hunter 01|Maybe?
Skellige Hunter 01|Whoa!
Skellige Hunter 01|Freya!
Skellige Hunter 01|You'll not escape.
Skellige Hunter 01|Die!
Skellige Hunter 01|Round the left! Now!

Skellige Hunter 01|By Hemdall!
Skellige Hunter 01|Noooo!
Skellige Hunter 01|Pshaw.
Skellige Hunter 01|Put ye down like a dog!
Skellige Hunter 01|Fuck!
Skellige Hunter 01|Then Lugos grabbed his battle axe… cleaved 'im in two with one blow! In halves!
Skellige Hunter 01|Spend too much time in the woods… Really miss tales like that!
Skellige Hunter 01|Ice Giant, then that werewolf Morkvarg… You been busy, witcher.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Hunter 02|Don't ye putter 'round here.
Skellige Hunter 02|Go back where you come from.
Skellige Hunter 02|We deal with our own monsters.
Skellige Hunter 02|Need somethin'?
Skellige Hunter 02|Don't know ye, don't wanna know ye.
Skellige Hunter 02|Split!
Skellige Hunter 02|Fuck me!
Skellige Hunter 02|Fuck!
Skellige Hunter 02|Game can't hear a hunter in the rain. Can't smell 'im, either.
Skellige Hunter 02|Wench'd like to sit Svanrige on the throne.
Skellige Hunter 02|Don't mean much to me, that.
Skellige Hunter 02|Tellin' ye, it's a marvel. A zefhar, twisted four-fold, reinforced with whale bone. Do I buy it?
Skellige Hunter 02|Will you pester me 'bout that again?
Skellige Hunter 02|Forest grant you generous bounty.
Skellige Hunter 02|Where ye walkin'?!
Skellige Hunter 02|Why you whoreson…!
Skellige Hunter 02|I'll rip out yer liver.

Skellige Hunter 02|Faster, dammit! Move!
Skellige Hunter 02|We'll avenge ye!
Skellige Hunter 02|Aaaaa-ah!
Skellige Hunter 02|Spawn of a slave and an eyeless goat!
Skellige Hunter 02|Hjalmar killed the Ice Giant on his own, didn't need no witcher's help.
Skellige Hunter 02|And when the werebears attacked Kaer Trolde - where were you then?
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Hunter 03|Greetings.
Skellige Hunter 03|Sturdy weapon.
Skellige Hunter 03|Yeah?
Skellige Hunter 03|Ah shit…

Skellige Hunter 03|Hound's blood!
Skellige Hunter 03|Oh, fuck!
Skellige Hunter 03|Shit!
Skellige Hunter 03|Hope the old sow's put away me tanned furs.
Skellige Hunter 03|Monster or no, somethin' evil's taken root in the forest. It's killin' folk.
Skellige Hunter 03|And it ain't no rabid hound nor mad elk cow.
Skellige Hunter 03|You'd do better joinin' me to hunt than spreadin' gossip.
Skellige Hunter 03|Ye really intend to leave 'im?
Skellige Hunter 03|Naye… Don't think so.
Skellige Hunter 03|Akh! Ptooey.
Skellige Hunter 03|Fuck.
Skellige Hunter 03|Save yourselves!
Skellige Hunter 03|I'll clatter that pale mug o' yours…
Skellige Hunter 03|I'll kill ye.
Skellige Hunter 03|Gotta… attack… together!
Skellige Hunter 03|Hide! Take cover!
Skellige Hunter 03|Eh?
Skellige Hunter 03|I'll piss on your grave!
Skellige Hunter 03|You fucker!
Skellige Hunter 03|Can't sail out to fish with the Black Ones around, so gotta just catch more game…
Skellige Hunter 03|Freya save the queen!
Skellige Hunter 03|Freya save the king!
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Innkeeper 01|Then he says, "Fill me horn with mead." So I filled it. To the brim.
Skellige Innkeeper 01|He drank it down, smashed it on the floor and hollered, "Ice Vermin, I'm comin' for ye!" Whole story, right there.
Skellige Innkeeper 01|Sober up - then we'll chat.
Skellige Innkeeper 01|I think the lad'll run off again.
Skellige Innkeeper 01|Ohh, don't know about that…
Skellige Innkeeper 01|Greetin's!
Skellige Innkeeper 01|May Hemdall protect you…
Skellige Innkeeper 01|From your hangover on the morn! Hahaha!
Skellige Innkeeper 01|Why so pale? Seen the White Whale, have ye?
Skellige Innkeeper 01|Bit weebley, eh?
Skellige Innkeeper 01|Oy, seems you're a few sheets to the wind too many.
Skellige Innkeeper 01|People! Help me! Please!
Skellige Innkeeper 01|Used to sail with a warrior with not two, but four swords on his back! And two axes at his belt.
Skellige Innkeeper 01|Ever tried fishbone moonshine?
Skellige Innkeeper 01|Maybe them berserkers destroyed the village?
Skellige Innkeeper 01|A bear's strength and human wit, that'd do to break down a gate and light some fires…
Skellige Innkeeper 01|You're tellin' tales, right?
Skellige Innkeeper 01|Aye, aye, me dears! King Svanrige himself has drunk beer at me tavern!
Skellige Innkeeper 01|Aye, aye, me dears! King Hjalmar himself has drunk mead at me tavern!
Skellige Innkeeper 01|Aye, aye, me dears! Queen Cerys herself has drunk ale at me tavern!
Skellige Innkeeper 01|Our savior Geralt of Rivia! The one cut the dome off Morkvarg!
Skellige Innkeeper 01|Hear that witch of yours got the priestesses well peeved… Careful they don't curse you, too!

Skellige Old Man 01|Aye, 'course.

Skellige Old Man 01|I'm tellin ye, lost his eye in a tavern brawl, not on no raid.
Skellige Old Man 01|Don't know what to think anymore…
Skellige Old Man 01|Ye came to our isles, ye saved us from the giant.
Skellige Old Man 01|So now Hjalmar will go after the Black Ones…
Skellige Old Man 01|Svanrige's Bran's blood, won't let the Black Ones live!
Skellige Old Man 01|Black Ones wouldn't be on Undvik if we'd a man on the throne, as it should be.

Skellige Old Man 02|No use complainin' 'bout the weather.
Skellige Old Man 02|Rotten squirt lied to me face!

Skellige Old Man 02|Far too dear.
Skellige Old Man 02|Fine, fine.

Skellige Old Man 02|You were there, in the keep?! When the werebears attacked?!
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Old Man 03|Akh akh.

Skellige Old Man 03|Holy Bosom of Freya!
Skellige Old Man 03|Here's how I see it - we join Holger, on some raids, then build a tavern with the loot! You in?
Skellige Old Man 03|What now?
Skellige Old Man 03|Gods bless the bravest!

Skellige Old Man 03|Ye did good, findin' who was guilty of the massacre. Shame on Lady Bran! Shame!
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Old Man 04|Gotta drive the sheep down from pasture.
Skellige Old Man 04|Bran was deathly ill, they say. When he knew the time had come, he went into the mountains.
Skellige Old Man 04|That I cannot believe.
Skellige Old Man 04|You wanted to sail to the Continent? To trade? Any truth to that?
Skellige Old Man 04|You gotta be kiddin', you gotta!
Skellige Old Man 04|Good day to ye.
Skellige Old Man 04|Go in health.

Skellige Old Man 04|Give me strength, gods, that I might hunt once more.
Skellige Old Man 04|Not bad as steel goes.

Skellige Old Man 04|Lady Bran's no lady, she was a vile bitch! 'Twas right she paid with her head!
Skellige Old Man 04|Is it true blood splattered far as the castle ceiling?! Were you there?

Skellige Old Woman 01|What brings ye here?
Skellige Old Woman 01|Good day, good day.
Skellige Old Woman 01|Greetings, greetings.
Skellige Old Woman 01|What can one say?
Skellige Old Woman 01|Greetings.
Skellige Old Woman 01|Goddess, help me!
Skellige Old Woman 01|Aaahh!
Skellige Old Woman 01|Gods!
Skellige Old Woman 01|Ah!
Skellige Old Woman 01|She's a great lady, now, 'cause her son sails with Holger, brings back riches.
Skellige Old Woman 01|Ain't no use dwellin' on it!
Skellige Old Woman 01|Maybe you should see the druids 'bout that ache?
Skellige Old Woman 01|Seems to me you're from afar.
Skellige Old Woman 01|Watch it!
Skellige Old Woman 01|Freya, holiest mother!
Skellige Old Woman 01|Right, show me what you got.
Skellige Old Woman 01|Tell the jarl, he's in charge.
Skellige Old Woman 01|Didn't see their son a half year, but when he came back - ooh la la! So draped with jewels he could barely walk!
Skellige Old Woman 01|By Mörhogg's wraiths!
Skellige Old Woman 01|Aye, most likely.
Skellige Old Woman 01|Queen Cerys rules, and that is good! Maybe she'll knock some sense in those hot-tempered heads!
Skellige Old Woman 01|In Freya's garden, of all places?! What vile blasphemy'd you and that witch work there?
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Old Woman 02|Witcher.
Skellige Old Woman 02|Monster slayer. My gran told me 'bout you.
Skellige Old Woman 02|You steal folks' kiddies? Is it true?
Skellige Old Woman 02|Gran told me you blaspheme the gods.
Skellige Old Woman 02|Greetings, witcher.
Skellige Old Woman 02|Save me!
Skellige Old Woman 02|Help!
Skellige Old Woman 02|No! No!
Skellige Old Woman 02|Thaaat's why the old coot's bones were achin'.
Skellige Old Woman 02|Found her in the bay, gutted like a herring… Crabs and crayfish had had quite the feast.
Skellige Old Woman 02|All because she ran around with that bandit!
Skellige Old Woman 02|See no point lendin' credence to gossip.
Skellige Old Woman 02|Will your lad sail on the jarl's longboat?
Skellige Old Woman 02|Grant me patience, Freya!
Skellige Old Woman 02|Greetings.
Skellige Old Woman 02|How are yes?
Skellige Old Woman 02|*Sigh* Ech!
Skellige Old Woman 02|Grant me patience…
Skellige Old Woman 02|Me oh my!
Skellige Old Woman 02|You knew King Bran?
Skellige Old Woman 02|Twas true what me gran said - no monster can get the better of ye. Morkvarg has come and gone!
Skellige Old Woman 02|Till Hjalmar and Geralt, heroes brave,
Skellige Old Woman 02|Cut him down in his icy cave!
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Old Woman 03|What am I to do now?
Skellige Old Woman 03|They say he went after that bear with but a knife. How was he to survive?
Skellige Old Woman 03|Weeelll… Might be true.
Skellige Old Woman 03|That war gonna come or no?
Skellige Old Woman 03|Come again?
Skellige Old Woman 03|To have strength to the last!
Skellige Old Woman 03|How d'ye do!
Skellige Old Woman 03|Pale, y'are…
Skellige Old Woman 03|Don't cross our lads.
Skellige Old Woman 03|Oy!
Skellige Old Woman 03|Killers!
Skellige Old Woman 03|Help me! Someone!
Skellige Old Woman 03|And a pox upon our foes…
Skellige Old Woman 03|Lookin' awful pale…
Skellige Old Woman 03|And beware of bandits in the hills!
Skellige Old Woman 03|Ye don't fear none, do ye? Ye thumped Lugos in the mug, knocked the giant on his arse, gutted Morkvarg…
Skellige Old Woman 03|Think of all she can change, our Cerys!
Skellige Old Woman 03|*Heavy sigh* Ehh, young an Craite's no different than Crach. Jarls'll still be at each others' throats…
Skellige Old Woman 03|If the jarls feuded and fought under King Bran, why should they stop now his son's on the throne?
Skellige Old Woman 03|Twas you aided Udalryk, eh? You and Cerys an Craite!
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Old Woman 04|Rainin' again.
Skellige Old Woman 04|Gossip 'bout young an Craite - think it's true?
Skellige Old Woman 04|Ah, that's rubbish.
Skellige Old Woman 04|Think they'd dare do it?
Skellige Old Woman 04|Yaaaawn…
Skellige Old Woman 04|Greeti-- *Sneezes* Greetings!
Skellige Old Woman 04|Hahaha…
Skellige Old Woman 04|Aye?
Skellige Old Woman 04|Now there's a warrior. *Whistles*
Skellige Old Woman 04|Ah. Sorry.
Skellige Old Woman 04|You spied a dragon?!
Skellige Old Woman 04|Spare me!
Skellige Old Woman 04|…may he meet an honorable death. Or come home with honorable plunder.
Skellige Old Woman 04|Charm the lasses, not an old gran like me.
Skellige Old Woman 04|Sturdy lad.
Skellige Old Woman 04|That's the way to win respect in Skellige…
Skellige Old Woman 04|Heard songs about your deeds already, you know that?
Skellige Old Woman 04|Ye don't even fear the dark god Svalblod. That I didn't expect…
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Priestess 01|Oh my…
Skellige Priestess 01|And if it's true? The Naglfar on Hindarsfjall's shores…?
Skellige Priestess 01|May Modron Freya watch us and keep us…
Skellige Priestess 01|Ahhhh…
Skellige Priestess 01|Is it true what the villagers say?
Skellige Priestess 01|I do not know…
Skellige Priestess 01|Bless ye.
Skellige Priestess 01|The grace of the goddess wash over you.
Skellige Priestess 01|Let Freya be your guide.
Skellige Priestess 01|Sweet Mother…
Skellige Priestess 01|Please, be careful…
Skellige Priestess 01|Don't harm me!
Skellige Priestess 01|No! Eeeek! Aahhhhh! Help, help!
Skellige Priestess 01|You who grant us Love, Hatred and Strength…
Skellige Priestess 01|The Reverend Mother grows weak, I think. I've not seen her at morning prayers in ages…
Skellige Priestess 01|Have the other sisters heard?
Skellige Priestess 01|Yes?
Skellige Priestess 01|A killer.
Skellige Priestess 01|Have you not done evil enough?!
Skellige Priestess 01|No!
Skellige Priestess 01|Begone from here!
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Priestess 02|Modron sends the sun and Modron sends the rain.
Skellige Priestess 02|Vows barely sworn, and already she makes eyes at every lad come to pay an offering!
Skellige Priestess 02|Hmmmm...
Skellige Priestess 02|Will Mother Superior give her leave to go home? Word is her father's dreadfully weak…
Skellige Priestess 02|Ah, leave it be.
Skellige Priestess 02|Bow before Modron Freya.
Skellige Priestess 02|We serve Her who is Virgin, Mother and Crone.
Skellige Priestess 02|What is it you wish?
Skellige Priestess 02|Seems he did not come to pray.
Skellige Priestess 02|Watch your strut!
Skellige Priestess 02|Don't touch me!
Skellige Priestess 02|Heeeeeelp!
Skellige Priestess 02|Grant my brother strength, that his sword lie light in his palm, and the Nilfgaardian necks lie exposed.
Skellige Priestess 02|Godless swine.
Skellige Priestess 02|Modron Freya is patient, but she brooks no insult.
Skellige Priestess 02|Away with you.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Priestess 03|Akh akh.
Skellige Priestess 03|Mother Sigfrida says a sorceress once tried to take the jewel Brisingamen.
Skellige Priestess 03|Aaaahhhh.
Skellige Priestess 03|Will the weather hold, what do you think?
Skellige Priestess 03|Seems so.
Skellige Priestess 03|*Cough cough* Greetings.
Skellige Priestess 03|Freya be with you.
Skellige Priestess 03|I'm listening, wanderer.
Skellige Priestess 03|Kneel before the goddess. Pay Her homage.
Skellige Priestess 03|Watch how you walk!
Skellige Priestess 03|Are you mad, you twit?
Skellige Priestess 03|Aaaaah, noooooo!
Skellige Priestess 03|Freya, hear my prayer. Freya, grant my plea.
Skellige Priestess 03|Pray with me.
Skellige Priestess 03|Akh akh akh akh.
Skellige Priestess 03|No amount of prayer can help you now.
Skellige Priestess 03|Begone.
Skellige Priestess 03|Your very names be cursed!

Skellige Scribe 01|Ahh… Life.
Skellige Scribe 01|On Faroe they fear to sail out, for Madman Lugos attacks even their fishing yoles!
Skellige Scribe 01|Do you believe it?
Skellige Scribe 01|And from whom did you hear it?
Skellige Scribe 01|And what tidings from the Continent are true? In your estimation?
Skellige Scribe 01|Truly, I know not what to say.
Skellige Scribe 01|Everyone just leave me be, for Freya's sake.
Skellige Scribe 01|Oh. Another unable to spell his own name.
Skellige Scribe 01|What do you want?
Skellige Scribe 01|Here all solve their own problems.
Skellige Scribe 01|Provided their problems can be solved with an axe.
Skellige Scribe 01|Watch it!
Skellige Scribe 01|That is not at all amusing.
Skellige Scribe 01|Good folk! Help me!
Skellige Scribe 01|They say Hjalmar an Craite's dead.
Skellige Scribe 01|Incredible.
Skellige Scribe 01|Eh?
Skellige Scribe 01|A hack? A quill pusher? The quill is mightier than the sword!
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Scribe 02|Well, well.
Skellige Scribe 02|Listen! Er-ermion himself f-feared to en-enter the c-cursed wood!
Skellige Scribe 02|Heard it already at the tavern.

Skellige Scribe 02|Wh-where'd you get that idea?

Skellige Villager 01|Let our Hjalmar be your guide! He felled the giant!
Skellige Villager 01|The things that went on at Crach's castle… Still washin' the blood off the floor…
<|endoftext|>

Skellige Villager 03|Every man on the Continent so bloodless?
Skellige Villager 03|But can ye swing an axe?
Skellige Villager 03|Hah! Queen Cerys is not just clever, she's comely, too!
Skellige Villager 03|Blood ain't water. Crach an Craite's a bold man, King Hjalmar'll be, too!
Skellige Villager 03|Bran feasts with the gods, and his son on sits the throne. It is as it should be!
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Villager 04|Who's that oddball?
Skellige Villager 04|Mighty warrior, that one.
Skellige Villager 04|Another one stricken come to see the druids.
Skellige Villager 04|Not from 'round here, are ye?
Skellige Villager 04|Afore you head after the giant, best talk to Himli at the tavern.
Skellige Villager 04|Look ill to me.
Skellige Villager 04|Calm yourself, no one here'll mess with ye.
Skellige Villager 04|Control yourself.
Skellige Villager 04|Slanty eyes, must be Zerrikanian.
Skellige Villager 04|Not a weakling, I reckon, but my coin says he can't best the giant.
Skellige Villager 04|No monsters here, ye can put that away.
Skellige Villager 04|Deepest respects.
Skellige Villager 04|Greetings.
Skellige Villager 04|Welcome, welcome!
Skellige Villager 04|Maybe he's lookin' to get hired on a ship?
Skellige Villager 04|*Sneezes* Aaaaah-choooo!
Skellige Villager 04|Cross me heart, it's true! Five of 'em, steel-clad from head to toe…
Skellige Villager 04|And not a one came back alive from Freya's Gardens!
Skellige Villager 04|Quite the story. My, my.
Skellige Villager 04|Ye see the bulls this year? Fancy tryin' to hunt one down?

Skellige Villager 04|Most Hallowed Modron, lift the curse from me clan…
Skellige Villager 04|Whoa, what's this? Ye loot the Nilfgaardian flagship?
Skellige Villager 04|Geralt?
Skellige Villager 04|Mhm?
Skellige Villager 04|What'd I say? Not a soul in the Isles can go toe-to-toe with ye.
Skellige Villager 04|That giant? I wager ye, not Hjalmar, did all the work.
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Villager 05|Nothin' here for ye.
Skellige Villager 05|Nothin' here for you.
Skellige Villager 05|This here's a calm village.
Skellige Villager 05|Decent folk live here.
Skellige Villager 05|Tend to our own problems.
Skellige Villager 05|Leg it!
Skellige Villager 05|No!
Skellige Villager 05|Aaah!
Skellige Villager 05|Don't take a soothsayer to know when it's rainin'.
Skellige Villager 05|Lugos's gone completely mad. He's razed Donar's villages!
Skellige Villager 05|That's true! Heard the same!
Skellige Villager 05|Will ye enlist with me?
Skellige Villager 05|Ask me the morrow.
Skellige Villager 05|We stick together, it'll all work out!
Skellige Villager 05|What's new?
Skellige Villager 05|Step aside!
Skellige Villager 05|Oh Freya, Ye who rule land and sea!
Skellige Villager 05|Pff, all rubbish.
Skellige Villager 05|You bring ill luck, White One! First a massacre at Kaer Trolde, now the Black Ones on Undvik…
Skellige Villager 05|King Bran was a good ruler, but does that mean Svanrige deserves the crown?
Skellige Villager 05|Hjalmar's no Crach - lacks prudence. No, no good'll come of this…
Skellige Villager 05|Bah, not about to bow before that lass…
<|endoftext|>
Skellige Villager 06|Hm?
Skellige Villager 06|Go on, lively!
Skellige Villager 06|A witcher.
Skellige Villager 06|Eh?
Skellige Villager 06|Hide!
Skellige Villager 06|Move it!
Skellige Villager 06|Yaaaaawn…
Skellige Villager 06|Then the jarl on Hindarsfjall sacrificed a whole flock to the gods!
Skellige Villager 06|So they'd send a man with the courage and strength to slay Morkvarg…
Skellige Villager 06|Ye don't say?!
Skellige Villager 06|Take it to the jarl. He'll listen!
Skellige Villager 06|Naaah.
Skellige Villager 06|I'll be damned! Who's this…?
Skellige Villager 06|I'm a simple chap, seek no trouble.
Skellige Villager 06|So there's truth to that blather 'bout the Ice Giant…
Skellige Villager 06|Oyoy.
Skellige Villager 06|The gods' mercy!
Skellige Villager 06|Great Most Hallowed Mother.
Skellige Villager 06|*Sighs* Ehh, if I were a rich man.
Skellige Villager 06|Tis true what they say - no cure for trouble like a witcher!
Skellige Villager 06|Heard this one? Ahem. The towering hulk, that frosty plague…
Skellige Villager 06|Laid on the ground, and for his life begged. But Geralt the Riv, not frightened, not stirred, his heart tore out, fed it to the birds!

Skellige Woman 01|Wonder if his little sword's still got what it takes…
Skellige Woman 01|Aye, a beauty, but wasn't that sword I had in mind.
Skellige Woman 01|A roarin' gale!

Skellige Woman 02|Tell me honestly - you believe that?
Skellige Woman 02|Mean you won't visit your own mum?
Skellige Woman 02|Come again?

Toussaint Bandit Weak 06|Light the fire! We need reinforcements!
Toussaint Bandit Weak 06|The whole of us! At once!
Toussaint Bandit Weak 06|Take him alive!
Toussaint Bandit Weak 06|You killed him! You son of a tartmunch!
Toussaint Bandit Weak 06|You maggot-bummed freak!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Bandit Weak 07|I'll give it a go from the right!
Toussaint Bandit Weak 07|What? Curses!
Toussaint Bandit Weak 07|Is that eau de cadavre you're wearing…?
Toussaint Bandit Weak 07|And now, blood shall flow…
Toussaint Bandit Weak 07|Let the blood flow! Flow like wine!
Toussaint Bandit Weak 07|You weary me, gray gullet.
Toussaint Bandit Weak 07|I can't believe it… I can't believe this mangled muff minder smashed Fourfingers' hanse…
Toussaint Bandit Weak 07|We cannot let him get away!
Toussaint Bandit Weak 07|Oh, burndyducks! I despise sorcery.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Bandit Weak 08|Left! Go left!
Toussaint Bandit Weak 08|The hanse never forgives, gray tufts.
Toussaint Bandit Weak 08|Too too too too too…
Toussaint Bandit Weak 08|Shall we dance?
Toussaint Bandit Weak 08|Your stones are sweating, gray crotch!
Toussaint Bandit Weak 08|What?! Will you turn pansy and run?!
Toussaint Bandit Weak 08|This bumbuttered bork killed Loth Halfbreed?!
Toussaint Bandit Weak 08|Onward, hanse! Together!
Toussaint Bandit Weak 08|Bumbotch me backwards!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Bandit Weak 09|Curses, try to surround him!
Toussaint Bandit Weak 09|Nooooooooo!
Toussaint Bandit Weak 09|Crikeys! Help!
Toussaint Bandit Weak 09|Saintly scrotch! He's fast!
Toussaint Bandit Weak 09|It was that close!! That bloody close!!
Toussaint Bandit Weak 09|I shall kill you. Know why? Because I'm bored.
Toussaint Bandit Weak 09|You nit, you louse, you cur! You slaughtered Starling Straggen's hanse?!
Toussaint Bandit Weak 09|Blimey, twoot-sniffer's fast!
Toussaint Bandit Weak 09|Ooph, crikey!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Bard Man 01|I've heard enough. My word.
Toussaint Bard Man 01|Jumping junipers! That's something.
Toussaint Bard Man 01|In Toussaint, it is easier to find a bard without a lute than a bard who is sober…
Toussaint Bard Man 01|You may write a resounding refrain, or sing a marvelous tune, yet inside your head will remain, an achingly quiet and empty croon.
Toussaint Bard Man 01|Sir Geralt the Superb slew the Beast, not for glory but to bring the land peace!
Toussaint Bard Man 01|Geralt of Rivia, his age notwithstanding, defeated the Beast, a foe most demanding, he then rescued our town of joy and song, from the vile claws of a vampiric throng!
Toussaint Bard Man 01|Greetings!
Toussaint Bard Man 01|What's this now?!
Toussaint Bard Man 01|They say Oxenfurt scholars have proved alcohol is bad for our health. And we are to drink naught but… water!
Toussaint Bard Man 01|The witcher, the recent arrival - he's quite the art lover, apparently. And what he loves most is to pose with his bum bared!
Toussaint Bard Man 01|You won't believe it! They say someone snuck up to Reginald d'Aubry's statue and chiseled off his… jewels!
Toussaint Bard Man 01|Wait a minute, wait a minute! Aaaaaargh!
Toussaint Bard Man 01|Behold, a man of the blade.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Bard Man 02|Rumors, rumors, rumors.
Toussaint Bard Man 02|What a bloody daft yarn!
Toussaint Bard Man 02|Oh-ho! Someone got up on the wrong side of the bed!
Toussaint Bard Man 02|Ooh la la! No jesting with this one.
Toussaint Bard Man 02|That silver mane… Was it not you who won the knights' tourney?
Toussaint Bard Man 02|Geralt, you must hightail it out of here. The duchess is deadly serious.
Toussaint Bard Man 02|Heh, heh - greetings!
Toussaint Bard Man 02|That's just plain rude!
Toussaint Bard Man 02|One of the horses collapsed beneath a knight at the starting line during the tourney. Apparently he had fed it fisstech to make it swifter!
Toussaint Bard Man 02|The hairdresser, Jean Louis - a knight kidnapped him and threatened to disembowel him. All because Louis gave him a crooked cut.
Toussaint Bard Man 02|They say Durand Faucher-Plamondon de Savarin went mad and summoned some demon that devoured all the friends of history!
Toussaint Bard Man 02|Witcher! Calm down!
Toussaint Bard Man 02|Well, heidily-ho!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Bard Man 03|Come, now. That is clearly rubbish.
Toussaint Bard Man 03|I don't know… It might be true, it might not be.
Toussaint Bard Man 03|The famed witcher from the North!
Toussaint Bard Man 03|Seek shelter, ladies, the witcher's on the prowl!
Toussaint Bard Man 03|Her Grace's sister was behind the murders… Now that is basis for a ballad!
Toussaint Bard Man 03|Oh, a truly happy ending! Long live the duchess! Long live witcher Geralt!
Toussaint Bard Man 03|Hey there, old chap!
Toussaint Bard Man 03|Hayseed dung smearer!
Toussaint Bard Man 03|Our knights - so immaculately virtuous, yet two brawled over a girl at the Belles! They ripped each other's chest hair out, they say. Clearly, they were bereft of their armor at the time.
Toussaint Bard Man 03|The word is some tarts outside town began to play at summoning spirits. They actually managed to summon a wraith and… wham-bam! Gone in seconds, all of them!
Toussaint Bard Man 03|Have you heard? That barbarous witcher from the North defeated the Maestro at fisticuffs!
Toussaint Bard Man 03|Whoa, have you made my virtue your quarry?!
Toussaint Bard Man 03|I'm, hm, something like sleepy… Nostalgic… No, more at pensive…
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Bard Man 04|But that's complete and utter hogwash.
Toussaint Bard Man 04|Ooh la la!
Toussaint Bard Man 04|Dooo! Reee! Miii! Fiddlesticks, I'm always off-key when hungover.
Toussaint Bard Man 04|Right and true, the knight returned from his days at war, yet the lass for whom he'd pined and yearned, had married just days before.
Toussaint Bard Man 04|Ahem, listen to this - "The witcher of whitened locks, harkened to the people's cries, and cleft in twain the foul Beast's hocks, so it shall never its terror reprise."
Toussaint Bard Man 04|Is that how it's to be, witcher? You save us from the Beast, and Her Grace - hop-chop, off with his head?
Toussaint Bard Man 04|Cheerio!
Toussaint Bard Man 04|All your damn bums be botched!
Toussaint Bard Man 04|Apparently they're to ban racing come springtime. Know why? Some druids wrote the duchess, complaining it tires the mounts!
Toussaint Bard Man 04|Geralt, the chap who won the tourney - do you know the man? Apparently, he's no knight at all!
Toussaint Bard Man 04|Ravix, the chap who won the tourney - do you know the man? Apparently, he's no knight at all! And his name's not Ravix, but Geralt!
Toussaint Bard Man 04|Save me!
Toussaint Bard Man 04|Change your foot-wrappings, mate! Ugh!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Bard Man 05|Let me keep then, please, this treasury of memories, this magic blossom glistening with tear-like drops of dew. It I shall cherish until the day I perish, this living sign of love that bloomed that we so fiercely once consumed.
Toussaint Bard Man 05|On destiny's slender path endure, in battle, rage, persist. Your blade shall know no taste of rust - blood shall its sheen obscure.
Toussaint Bard Man 05|One day you're there drinking wine, the next some vampire's drinking your blood…
Toussaint Bard Man 05|The duchy will never be the same again without our Grace, the duchess…
Toussaint Bard Man 05|The witcher they summoned - he murdered the kings of the North! Or so the dockside merchants say…
Toussaint Bard Man 05|Do you know what I heard? Filibert Fourfingers and his hanse, they've been gutted to a man! They say Filibert howled like an urchin, but the witcher showed no mercy and lopped off his head!
Toussaint Bard Man 05|Have you heard about the quarry? They say the lads hung up their picks when a rain of cows came pummeling down!
Toussaint Bard Man 05|Are you drunk?! Do you want to make trouble?!
Toussaint Bard Man 05|Incredible…
Toussaint Bard Man 05|I couldn't care less. Instead of gossiping, why don't you take up some fruitful labor?
Toussaint Bard Man 05|Had a bit much?!
Toussaint Bard Man 05|Ehh. Hullo.
Toussaint Bard Man 05|Vanity of vanities… all is narcissism.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Bard Man 06|Oh my goodness!
Toussaint Bard Man 06|Yeees - akh akh - I heard the same.
Toussaint Bard Man 06|Godfried Nork - akh akh - the famed charcutier… imprisoned! For poisoning Her Grace's court with rotten sausages!
Toussaint Bard Man 06|Akh akh. Rumor has it someone slew Count Salvaress' silver basilisk. When the count learned of it, he blew his lid, dropped dead before nightfall!
Toussaint Bard Man 06|Did you hear about the massacre at the last meeting of the historical society?! Devoured, all of them, by some elven - akh akh - statuary!
Toussaint Bard Man 06|My regards.
Toussaint Bard Man 06|And the brave knights - akh - lunged - akh akh - at one another's throats… akh.
Toussaint Bard Man 06|Maybe I should mull a bit of wine? To soothe the throat…
Toussaint Bard Man 06|Geralt! Akheh… Toussaint's savior extraordinaire!
Toussaint Bard Man 06|The tourney may know only one… akh! Champion! Akh!
Toussaint Bard Man 06|Spare a poor, innocent bard…
Toussaint Bard Man 06|Watch out! Akh akh!
Toussaint Bard Man 06|Witcher Geralt! Akh akh… In the flesh!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Bard Woman 01|Really?!
Toussaint Bard Woman 01|Bollocks. Enough said.
Toussaint Bard Woman 01|You wish to live forever? Invest in a bard!
Toussaint Bard Woman 01|For tourney participants - chivalric epics, half price!
Toussaint Bard Woman 01|Sir Geralt, the tourney's victor!
Toussaint Bard Woman 01|Sir Ravix, the tourney's champion!
Toussaint Bard Woman 01|All due respect.
Toussaint Bard Woman 01|My knight?!
Toussaint Bard Woman 01|The hanses mean no end of trouble for the merchants. Another caravan's gone missing, and the river spat up more bodies… all decapitated!
Toussaint Bard Woman 01|Have you heard? The witcher gave the Maestro a licking so fierce the bruiser retched up his supper!
Toussaint Bard Woman 01|Jean Louis has been found! The witcher from the North saved his hiney. It seems some knight sought to starve him to death - vengeance for a bad haircut!
Toussaint Bard Woman 01|Help! Someone! Good folk!
Toussaint Bard Woman 01|In need of a song, sir knight? Or an epic poem, perchance?
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Bard Woman 02|Where did you hear this?
Toussaint Bard Woman 02|Ah! Yes! It's true, I heard!
Toussaint Bard Woman 02|Somewhere, past the candy-striped sky, I shall fly, to a duchy called Toussaint, my, am I ever high…
Toussaint Bard Woman 02|Oh, dear, what can the matter be, seven old ladies got locked in the lavat'ry…
Toussaint Bard Woman 02|Diamonds to dookie, you'll not ever dare show yourself to the duchess again!
Toussaint Bard Woman 02|You fended off the beast, saved our duquessa's life… Aren't you the hero!
Toussaint Bard Woman 02|Salut, salut!
Toussaint Bard Woman 02|What's got your danglies in a vice?!
Toussaint Bard Woman 02|Some courtiers got drunk and went to the Caroberta Woods to hunt… never to return! Or so they say.
Toussaint Bard Woman 02|Get gobbled up by Count Salvaress' basilisk, and your family can apply for compensation! You'll get eternal rest, and your family will get a rollicking fest! Win-win!
Toussaint Bard Woman 02|That witcher from the North got an estate from Her Grace. She means him to replace Damien - as captain of the Ducal Guard!
Toussaint Bard Woman 02|Hey! Sugarlips! Calm down!
Toussaint Bard Woman 02|Hey, diddle, diddle, your mum's a fat fiddle! A cello, meaning!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Bard Woman 03|You don't say…!
Toussaint Bard Woman 03|Yeah, right!
Toussaint Bard Woman 03|All the great poets drank! It's the very reason I cannot be rid of this thirst…
Toussaint Bard Woman 03|Gaze long enough into an empty goblet, and the goblet's like to gaze back into you!
Toussaint Bard Woman 03|Friend! Looking for the best wine in Toussaint?! It's Geralt of Rivia - remember that name!
Toussaint Bard Woman 03|Have you heard the tale of Liam and Matilda? Love conquers all, even in business!
Toussaint Bard Woman 03|Hu-hu-hullo!
Toussaint Bard Woman 03|You watch where you put those paws!
Toussaint Bard Woman 03|They say all sorts of things about that witcher… Apparently, he's friends with Viscount Julian… the duquessa's former, you know… fellow!
Toussaint Bard Woman 03|You'll never guess who won the gwent tourney. The witcher - the very same the duchess summoned from the North!
Toussaint Bard Woman 03|The Beauclair cemetery's haunted! Haunted, I say! Ghosts prance about, moaning, rattling their chains and dragging the living into graves!
Toussaint Bard Woman 03|Madman! He's a madman!
Toussaint Bard Woman 03|I wager you could stand to toss back some wine.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Bard Woman 04|What's that to do with me?
Toussaint Bard Woman 04|Wow… wow.
Toussaint Bard Woman 04|Witcher? The very same of whom Master Dandelion sings?
Toussaint Bard Woman 04|Ahem, ahem… They sharpen their blades, their armor, they buff - but the tourney shall go to the brave and the tough!
Toussaint Bard Woman 04|Without Anna Henrietta, the duchy is no duchy at all!
Toussaint Bard Woman 04|What you did for Beauclair - we shall never forget!
Toussaint Bard Woman 04|Good day!
Toussaint Bard Woman 04|Brute!
Toussaint Bard Woman 04|Some merchants from Nazair bought fifteen barrels of water at market! And they paid as if it were Est Est!
Toussaint Bard Woman 04|They say our friseur, Jean Louis, has been found. Apparently, he had holed up in a cave outside town and drunk himself stupid! The witcher from the North had to drag him out of there.
Toussaint Bard Woman 04|Rumor has it the witcher does not kill monsters at all. That man-eating basilisk he just drove off, and he culled four noble knights in place of the beast.
Toussaint Bard Woman 04|Calm down, please!
Toussaint Bard Woman 04|White hair, cat eyes…
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Bard Woman 05|I heard someone say a certain Nilfgaardian appeared at Orianna's last… what was his name… Aep Banx!
Toussaint Bard Woman 05|And if you can imagine, he said he wished to cover all her walls with paintings! Like some primitive human! Or an elf!
Toussaint Bard Woman 05|They say bandits from Mont Crane attacked Casteldaccia, tortured the whole family to death, looted the estate and burned it to the ground…
Toussaint Bard Woman 05|Reginald has his ronnies back! Some old fogey had stolen them, hoping to make his withered stalk bloom anew!
Toussaint Bard Woman 05|Well, now you're officially spewing tripe…
Toussaint Bard Woman 05|I heard the very same.
Toussaint Bard Woman 05|Hen hinies!
Toussaint Bard Woman 05|Two swords, gray head… Whosoever's a monster soon shall be dead!
Toussaint Bard Woman 05|Past the barn, on yonder fence, the crowing cockerel sits. I'll come to you, my darling boy, as soon as I have pissed!
Toussaint Bard Woman 05|Our brave guardsmen may earn chicken feed, but they showed no fear defending us from vampires!
Toussaint Bard Woman 05|Great was our fear as death drew near… yet we were saved, the vampires graved!
Toussaint Bard Woman 05|Oh, mumsy! Help!
Toussaint Bard Woman 05|High five!
Toussaint Bard Woman 05|Kitty peepers, a face grim with strain, the witcher Geralt has labor pains!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Bard Woman 06|The Caroberta Woods have swallowed up yet more victims… Folk say… they're hauuuuunted! Heheh.
Toussaint Bard Woman 06|Some woman in town's gone mad. First she cut off her hubby's… bait and tackle, then, to spite all members of the uglier sex, she chiseled off Reginald's privates as well!
Toussaint Bard Woman 06|When Count Borhis di Salvaress learned the witcher had found his basilisk and - swish! - he was so aggrieved he found a sturdy tree branch and - clunk!
Toussaint Bard Woman 06|Ehh, there you go scheming again…
Toussaint Bard Woman 06|Pigs' trotters! That's quite the tale!
Toussaint Bard Woman 06|You would hit a woman?!
Toussaint Bard Woman 06|Did you fall for me at first sight, or did it take a time to sink in?
Toussaint Bard Woman 06|Where's the Guard?! You just stole my heart!
Toussaint Bard Woman 06|Ooh, the witcher, our hero!
Toussaint Bard Woman 06|Deadly effective, deadly good looks!
Toussaint Bard Woman 06|Why so aggressive?!
Toussaint Bard Woman 06|Hey, hey, hey!
Toussaint Bard Woman 06|Salut, clever man!

Toussaint Blacksmith 01|Hip hip hullo!
Toussaint Blacksmith 01|What can I forge for you today?
Toussaint Blacksmith 01|Bastards! Mauls! Misericordes!
Toussaint Blacksmith 01|Iron longs to be red hot!
Toussaint Blacksmith 01|Bravo, bumbotching bravo! A thumping good show at the tournament, witcher!
Toussaint Blacksmith 01|Watch it, or I'll take this hammer and--!
Toussaint Blacksmith 01|Hold on. What's this supposed to mean?
Toussaint Blacksmith 01|Behold, Geralt the witcher! The scourge of Starling Straggen and his hanse! Bravo, you old bumbasher!
Toussaint Blacksmith 01|What a story! A lone witcher against a swarm of those stone-stingers… And he licked them, one and all!
Toussaint Blacksmith 01|I heard you brought the hammer down on Fourfingers' hanse!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 01|A bottle of wine's enough for two, provided one's not drinking.
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 01|Women love tears, men prefer wine.
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 01|Smashing work, witcher. To take down the Beast…
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 01|Defeating the Beast, it was undeniably a feat. But to get Liam and Matilda to bury the hatchet…!
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 01|But… whatever… What's the problem?!
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 01|And you believe this tripe?
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 01|Not bad…
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 01|And Madame de Bourbeau, it seems, was letting some filthy farmhand mow her grass! They went at it so loud, old Bourbeau thought he had a monster in the cellar!
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 01|In the North there's a land, Velen it's called, where bellies are pinched so tight, folk don't drink wine, distilling instead hooch from tree bark and old boot lacings!
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 01|So it turned out Count Crespi incited the feud between Coronata and Vermentino. Hehe. Sly old goat… May he rest in peace!
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 01|Hey there!
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 01|Whoa, friend! Calm down!
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 01|Give this man some wine!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 02|Art is not life's bread and butter but its fruit and wine.
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 02|Wine - sunlight captured in a bottle.
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 02|Death has taken Her Grace. We must drown our sorrows in drink…
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 02|This marks the duchy's end. Its final hour!
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 02|Go on! Kill me! Do the deed!
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 02|Ehh, poppycock…
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 02|My, my… That is quite the tale.
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 02|De Bourbeau's got horns from here to Mont Crane! His wife's been frolicking about with some stablehand!
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 02|That witcher's been here before… As I recall, he slew a few beasts and stashed a pile of coin at Cianfanelli's!
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 02|The Monnart Brothers now make cognac so exquisite the emperor himself has put in an order!
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 02|Greetings and welcome!
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 02|Yes, sir?
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 03|And now I shall drink… dance… and repeat till the week is through!
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 03|One more! And another two!
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 03|Long live Geralt of Rivia! Long live the duquessa!
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 03|I shall drink to your health, Sir Geralt!
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 03|Ehh, surely you jest!
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 03|Oooh! Really?!
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 03|Hah! You've had one too many and have started spouting drivel.
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 03|The Monnart Brothers have reconciled and now produce a cognac so fine, it'll soon bring in more coin than all of Castel Ravello!
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 03|In the Caroberta Woods, amidst elven ruins, squats a sylvan. Whosoever kisses its bum will be showered with gold!
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 03|I heard someone's made off with Reginald d'Aubry's magic stones!
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 03|Well, well! Greetings!
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 03|Busy hands, haven't we?
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 03|A tip of the glass, good fellow!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 04|What's new, mon ami?
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 04|Oh my, do I ever need to whizz…
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 04|Of all the heroes, we get this one…
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 04|Have you not had enough? You've been in prison, were almost beheaded…
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 04|Demon dingles… murderer!
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 04|And you believe that?
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 04|It cannot be!
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 04|The truth apparently is thus - when the witcher killed the silver basilisk, Count di Salvaress' blood boiled so hot, he burst a vessel and up and died!
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 04|Do you know why Castel Ravello has good harvests, year in, year out? They import some alchemical dung from the empire, then fertilize their vines with it!
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 04|The witcher did not get that vineyard by killing monsters alone, you know…
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 04|Well, hey there! Hullo!
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 04|Fumbledungs!
Toussaint Bonvivant Man 04|Mon ami?
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 01|Two of those purportedly virtuous knights pummeled each other over a dockside whore. Apparently, they argued who would go first!
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 01|Some knavish knight abducted poor Jean Louis! Apparently, the rogue burned with passion for the hairdresser, but Jean Louis rejected him…
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 01|Did you hear about Madame de Bourbeau? She left her husband and ran off with some farm boy!
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 01|Our liberator! Geralt of Rivia!
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 01|A Beast like that probably has no one to split a bottle with.
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 01|What is they call you? Gervant?
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 01|Come, I must give you a squeeze, hero!
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 01|I wish you health! Glory! Honor!
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 01|He's gone mad! Positively mad!
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 01|Watch those hands!
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 01|Drink and be merry!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 02|One of the knights withdrew from the tourney. They say it was because of an itch he'd obtained at the Belles. Quite hard to scratch under metal cuisses, you know.
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 02|They say the vampires went wildest for virgin blood. So during the swarming, a great many had their corks popped. Just to be safe!
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 02|Have you heard who won the tourney?! Geralt of Rivia! That witcher!
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 02|Vampires attacked the city?! Hm, seems I slept through it all. Ah, the benefits of drunkenness.
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 02|Long live Her Grace! Three cheers for Toussaint!
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 02|Oh, is my head ever spinning after last night…
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 02|That is what I call a happy ending! Bravo, witcher!
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 02|You spew codswallop. You really ought not repeat all you hear.
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 02|The wonders!
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 02|Greetings!
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 02|Help!
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 02|Am I invisible?!
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 02|Life is beautiful.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 03|This one damsel sent knight after knight into the woods to bring glory to her name. As it turned out, she was working with Fourfingers' hanse, sending the poor fools straight into a trap!
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 03|And who won the gwent tourney? The witcher! Who hypnotized all the others, put them to sleep so he could swipe their best cards!
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 03|Tufo's owner, Monsieur de Bourbeau, is throwing a ball in celebration. And not because he's rid of the horror in his cellar, but because he's rid of his wife.
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 03|Do you know my favorite wine? It's Geralt of Rivia!
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 03|Still waters run deep…
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 03|Where are you skittering off to, Silvermane?
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 03|You go to one's head, Geralt! Oh, do you ever!
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 03|You don't say?
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 03|Noooo, that can't possibly be true.
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 03|Hulloooo!
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 03|Are you daft?! Calm down!
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 03|Sugar cookie! Teeheehee.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 04|They say the dye man at the port has such extraordinary new colors, some of the Belles charge him less if he dyes their skirts!
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 04|That ruffian, Filibert Fourfingers - do you know how he got his name? He was a cooper, see, went to cut a barrel stave and cut off his finger instead!
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 04|Do you know who recovered Reginald's jewels? The witcher! It seems some lonely widow had stolen them after bandits killed her hubby.
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 04|I'd not show myself to Her Grace anytime soon were I in your shoes…
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 04|Lebioda's chapped heels! I've got roaring heartburn!
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 04|Long live Toussaint!
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 04|Get moving, witcher! Scarper while you can! You've already seen the inside of the clink!
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 04|Unbelievable!
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 04|Actually, you don't even believe that.
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 04|Hey diddle diddle! The cat and the fiddle!
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 04|Guard! Guard!
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 04|Devils take you!
Toussaint Bonvivant Woman 04|The witcher from the North!

Toussaint Dockworker 01|Raiders have sunk so much loot off the Skellige Isles, you could fish for treasure for a year… and still not fish it all out! Or so they say…
Toussaint Dockworker 01|The lads at the quarry are back to cracking rocks. Apparently, that ace from the North came, scrubbed away the curse and rid the skies of cows!
Toussaint Dockworker 01|Heheh. Some crack fighter's beaten the Maestro. That's the word. Maestro burst into tears, then decided to turn druid! Hmhmhm.
Toussaint Dockworker 01|I'm so relieved all that's over… Long live the duquessa!
Toussaint Dockworker 01|The girl from Corvo Bianco goes walking…
Toussaint Dockworker 01|And when she passes, each one she passes goes, "Aaaaah."
Toussaint Dockworker 01|Witcher, we thank you, each and every one of us!
Toussaint Dockworker 01|Huh, bloody not bad, that.
Toussaint Dockworker 01|Pure flim-flam, that. What're you trying to pull…?
Toussaint Dockworker 01|Hey there.
Toussaint Dockworker 01|Graylocks! Silvermane! Argh!
Toussaint Dockworker 01|Ah!
Toussaint Dockworker 01|Yeaah?
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Dockworker 02|The Nilfgaardians fear the Beast so bad, they've shut their embassy, don't let anyone in - not even their own merchants who've come here to trade!
Toussaint Dockworker 02|With that cognac from the Monnart Brothers, they say hangovers are a thing of the past! Drink it all night and you'll wake up the next morn twice as strong!
Toussaint Dockworker 02|The drunken Maestro's sobered up! Gray-haired witcher bopped him so hard, he knocked him right back on the wagon!
Toussaint Dockworker 02|What'd you do to get our duquessa so hopping mad, eh?
Toussaint Dockworker 02|Farewell and adieu, to you, Beauclair ladies… Farewell and adieu, to you, maids of Toussaint!
Toussaint Dockworker 02|And we'll drink and be merry, and drown melancholy, singing here's to the health of each Toussaint-born lass!
Toussaint Dockworker 02|You're brave, witcher. That, or you don't like your head enough to want to keep it.
Toussaint Dockworker 02|Piddlewash. Though… could it be true?
Toussaint Dockworker 02|Yeah! Heard the same, I did.
Toussaint Dockworker 02|Greetings.
Toussaint Dockworker 02|Oh, mate, it seems you've gone all muddled in the mind!
Toussaint Dockworker 02|Would you mind apologizing?!
Toussaint Dockworker 02|Hey! Ho!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Dockworker 03|All the sailors see the dyers before going to the Belles. To get their breeches colored… They say the girls give it up for free to those in garish bloomers!
Toussaint Dockworker 03|You know Filibert Fourfingers? The leader of that hanse up Mont Crane? They say he takes a finger off any man whose life he spares, then adds it as a jewel to the string around his neck!
Toussaint Dockworker 03|Word is a witch lived up Lynx Crag, one who'd steal children, grind their bones to flour and bake gingerbread biscuits out of it!
Toussaint Dockworker 03|Vampires! I hate vampires!
Toussaint Dockworker 03|What do you do with a drunken sailor…?
Toussaint Dockworker 03|Ehh, dundering devils…
Toussaint Dockworker 03|I wonder what they'll do now. Will they seek out a replacement duchess?
Toussaint Dockworker 03|You've a bit of the nipple chafe, is that it? It's the only explanation for the nonsense you spew…
Toussaint Dockworker 03|My regards.
Toussaint Dockworker 03|What sort of ruckus is this…? Guard! Help!
Toussaint Dockworker 03|Whoa there, Uncle Feelyfingers!
Toussaint Dockworker 03|Yeah?
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Girl 31|Teeheeheehee! Aheeheehee! Hahaha! Oo hmhmhm.
Toussaint Girl 31|Uuuuugh…
Toussaint Girl 31|Woo-hh-woow!
Toussaint Girl 31|Will you run away from home with me?
Toussaint Girl 31|Hullo!
Toussaint Girl 31|Hurray!
Toussaint Girl 31|That hurts!
Toussaint Girl 31|Oh! Oh!
Toussaint Girl 31|Daddy!

Toussaint Inkeeper Woman 03|Eat, drink and be merry! Thus spake the Prophet Lebioda!
Toussaint Inkeeper Woman 03|The duquessa! Our sweet shining sun!
Toussaint Inkeeper Woman 03|Where's the fire?!
Toussaint Inkeeper Woman 03|Someone please summon the Guard!
Toussaint Inkeeper Woman 03|Kindest regards.
Toussaint Inkeeper Woman 03|He-llo!
Toussaint Inkeeper Woman 03|Our duquessa…
Toussaint Inkeeper Woman 03|What now? Without our duchess…?
Toussaint Inkeeper Woman 03|Yes? What?
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Knight 01|Gods, lend us verve!
Toussaint Knight 01|Sir?
Toussaint Knight 01|Yes, sir?
Toussaint Knight 01|I vow to fight the hanses to the death! Mine, or theirs!
Toussaint Knight 01|I swear on my honor! I shall smash the plunderers, scatter them to the winds and drive them from our duchy!
Toussaint Knight 01|The hanses banished, the bandits disbanded! Long live Sir Geralt!
Toussaint Knight 01|I salute you, sir! And once more thank you for the rescue!
Toussaint Knight 01|I shall be your debtor to my dying day! I thank you for the rescue, sir!
Toussaint Knight 01|You little imp…
Toussaint Knight 01|Don't move! I'll slit open your bowels…
Toussaint Knight 01|Now for a lesson in manners…
Toussaint Knight 01|Honor! The duquessa! Toussaint!
Toussaint Knight 01|I appeal to you for peace.
Toussaint Knight 01|Courage!
Toussaint Knight 01|No carousing, sir.
Toussaint Knight 01|Her Enlightened Highness is dead… yet it is not fitting to wallow in mourning.
Toussaint Knight 01|Courage!
Toussaint Knight 01|Now for a lesson in manners…
Toussaint Knight 01|Honor! The duquessa! Toussaint!
Toussaint Knight 01|Don't move! I shall slit open your bowels…
Toussaint Knight 01|You little imp…
Toussaint Knight 01|Gods, lend us verve!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Knight 02|How might I aid you?
Toussaint Knight 02|Yes, fellow knight and friend?
Toussaint Knight 02|Forward! Side by side! Arm in arm!
Toussaint Knight 02|Witcher!
Toussaint Knight 02|Enough! Or I shall resort to harsher means!
Toussaint Knight 02|A courageous heart overcomes all hindrance!
Toussaint Knight 02|To lose one's good name… it is worse than death!
Toussaint Knight 02|Witcher, I heard you defeated Filibert Fourfingers' hanse! Respect!
Toussaint Knight 02|Witcher! Remember, the camerlengo pays out a handsome reward for each hanse you despatch!
Toussaint Knight 02|You wrested Fox Hollow from Loth Halfbreed's clutches! You deserve a monument for that!
Toussaint Knight 02|Die!
Toussaint Knight 02|I am the punishment for your many sins!
Toussaint Knight 02|Your luck has run out, dog.
Toussaint Knight 02|I shall wash away that insult to our duchy's majesty with your blood!
Toussaint Knight 02|Don't lose spirit!
Toussaint Knight 02|Die!
Toussaint Knight 02|I am the punishment for your many sins!
Toussaint Knight 02|I shall wash away that insult to our duchy's majesty with your blood!

Toussaint Knight 02|Forward! Side by side! Arm in arm!
Toussaint Knight 02|Your luck has run out, dog.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Knight 03|Never retreat, not one step, not one footfall!
Toussaint Knight 03|This is your warning.
Toussaint Knight 03|Staging a one-man farce?
Toussaint Knight 03|Pardon my tongue, but that Loth Halfbreed was a horrid bumbotcher. Good of you to kill him!
Toussaint Knight 03|Praise to the grapes in whose effluent richness we drown!
Toussaint Knight 03|Sleep strengthens, and wine makes you sleepy. Ergo - wine strengthens!
Toussaint Knight 03|A knight, dear children, is a peculiar cross between a loose woman and a scholar - which is to say, he's a ploughing know-it-all!
Toussaint Knight 03|That's him! The slayer of Starling Straggen's band!
Toussaint Knight 03|Greetings, sourpuss!
Toussaint Knight 03|Why so cross? Have a tipple!
Toussaint Knight 03|Toussaint!
Toussaint Knight 03|Cut! Slice! Smash!
Toussaint Knight 03|You chose poorly, witcher!
Toussaint Knight 03|You shall perish, evil doer!
Toussaint Knight 03|No mercy!
Toussaint Knight 03|Toussaint!
Toussaint Knight 03|Cut! Slice! Smash!

Toussaint Knight 04|Hey-yo! Hey-yo! A knight's life is full of woe!
Toussaint Knight 04|Just and true, the knight returned from his days at war, yet the lass for whom he'd pined and yearned had married days before.
Toussaint Knight 04|Brave Sir Milton, you left us too soon. The sun on Toussaint shall no more shine, we shall no more delight in the taste of wine, and a dark curtain now obscures our moon.
Toussaint Knight 04|We sweat barrels of blood trying to disperse that Fourfingers' vandaguild… Then along comes a witcher, and with a huff and a puff, he blows the bumbotchers away!
Toussaint Knight 04|It was you who freed Fox Hollow? Yours is the honor and glory, witcher!
Toussaint Knight 04|Ho, ho! Fortune shine upon you!
Toussaint Knight 04|Greetings!
Toussaint Knight 04|The duquessa's death - a tragedy which will forever change the face of our fair land.
Toussaint Knight 04|Now! All together!
Toussaint Knight 04|One, two, one two - next to go to the grave is you!
Toussaint Knight 04|I'll show you, you rapscallion!
Toussaint Knight 04|Treacherous cur!
Toussaint Knight 04|Oh, harlotsbrood!
Toussaint Knight 04|What's that supposed to mean?
Toussaint Knight 04|Hey there! Whoa!
Toussaint Knight 04|Quickly! From the right! Now!
Toussaint Knight 04|Treacherous cur!
Toussaint Knight 04|I'll show you, you rapscallion!
Toussaint Knight 04|Oh, harlotsbrood!
Toussaint Knight 04|One, two, one two - next to go to the grave is you!
Toussaint Knight 04|Quickly! From the right! Now!

Toussaint Knight 05|It is not enough to speak, but to speak true.
Toussaint Knight 05|Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.
Toussaint Knight 05|Long live Her Grace, Anna Henrietta!
Toussaint Knight 05|Sir, that is most unbecoming…
Toussaint Knight 05|I beseech thee, sir!
Toussaint Knight 05|Cowards die many times before their deaths. The valiant never taste of death but once!
Toussaint Knight 05|Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile. Filths savor but themselves.
Toussaint Knight 05|My deepest respect to the tourney's champion!
Toussaint Knight 05|Behold, the bravest of the brave! The scourge of Starling Straggen's hanse!
Toussaint Knight 05|I must be cruel only to be kind!
Toussaint Knight 05|Ring the alarum-bells! Blow, wind! Come, wrack!
Toussaint Knight 05|You betrayed my trust, friend.
Toussaint Knight 05|At least I'll die with harness on my back!
Toussaint Knight 05|All together! No fear!
Toussaint Knight 05|By my troth! I owe you my life, witcher!
Toussaint Knight 05|A thousand thanks for your rescue!!
Toussaint Knight 05|All together! No fear!
Toussaint Knight 05|I must be cruel only to be kind!
Toussaint Knight 05|Ring the alarum-bells! Blow, wind! Come, wrack!

Toussaint Knight 06|How might I aid you?
Toussaint Knight 06|Yes, witcher?
Toussaint Knight 06|Faster!
Toussaint Knight 06|What are you on about?
Toussaint Knight 06|This behavior - has it some purport?
Toussaint Knight 06|Our duchess is usually very kind. Until suddenly she is very unkind.
Toussaint Knight 06|Witcher - act always with reason.
Toussaint Knight 06|Behold, the tourney's victor! Hallowed be his name!
Toussaint Knight 06|The witcher, our hero! Only one of your caliber could save us from the Beast.
Toussaint Knight 06|Loth Halfbreed, Starling Straggen, Filibert Fourfingers - all dead… My, oh my!
Toussaint Knight 06|The end! This is it!
Toussaint Knight 06|For the duchy! For the duquessa!
Toussaint Knight 06|And?! Now what, witcher?!
Toussaint Knight 06|I shall bleed you like a stuck pig!
Toussaint Knight 06|Look alive!
Toussaint Knight 06|And?! Now what, witcher?!
Toussaint Knight 06|Faster!
Toussaint Knight 06|Look alive!
Toussaint Knight 06|For the duchy! For the duquessa!
Toussaint Knight 06|The end! This is it!
Toussaint Knight 06|I shall bleed you like a stuck pig!

Toussaint Knight 07|Whooo-ee!
Toussaint Knight 07|Tah rah ree rah!
Toussaint Knight 07|For the duchess!
Toussaint Knight 07|What's this then?!
Toussaint Knight 07|Hey!
Toussaint Knight 07|Pastime with good company, I love and shall until I die. Grudge who lust, but none deny - so gods be pleased, thus live will I!
Toussaint Knight 07|For idleness is chief mistress of vices all - then who can say but mirth and play is best of all?
Toussaint Knight 07|Congratulations on your victory in the tourney, witcher!
Toussaint Knight 07|Sir Ravix, is it not? Congratulations on your victory in the tourney!
Toussaint Knight 07|You shall be harrowed by the sword - my sword!
Toussaint Knight 07|Come here, scamp!
Toussaint Knight 07|Lovely! Lovely!
Toussaint Knight 07|Behold the punishment for your foul deeds!
Toussaint Knight 07|For Toussaint!

Toussaint Knight 08|Welcome!
Toussaint Knight 08|Yes, my Lord?
Toussaint Knight 08|I shall never retreat, not one step!
Toussaint Knight 08|Enough of that! Behave!
Toussaint Knight 08|Friend…
Toussaint Knight 08|It is right and fitting, witcher, that the duquessa summoned, and you came!
Toussaint Knight 08|By my troth! It is the witcher who saved us from woe!
Toussaint Knight 08|By my troth! It is the witcher who saved us from woe!
Toussaint Knight 08|May our dear Duchess Anna Henrietta's spirit rest in peace.
Toussaint Knight 08|Duchess Anna Henrietta's death has made orphans of us all.
Toussaint Knight 08|The lust to do evil… I'll beat it out of you!
Toussaint Knight 08|Swish-swash! Swish-swash!
Toussaint Knight 08|You let us all down, witcher!
Toussaint Knight 08|Leaping Lebioda's wounds!
Toussaint Knight 08|Attack! Aaaa-ttaaaaack!
Toussaint Knight 08|Blunder me blind. I would be gone if not for your aid, comrade!
Toussaint Knight 08|Thank you, friend - for saving my enchained knightly bum!
Toussaint Knight 08|Lebioda's weeping wounds!
Toussaint Knight 08|Rack-a-thwack! Rack-a-thwack!
Toussaint Knight 08|You let us all down, witcher!
Toussaint Knight 08|The lust to do evil… I'll beat it out of you!
Toussaint Knight 08|I shall never retreat, not one step!

Toussaint Knight 09|Yeaaah?
Toussaint Knight 09|What do you seek, wanderer?
Toussaint Knight 09|Yes, friend?
Toussaint Knight 09|Move!
Toussaint Knight 09|Calm down!
Toussaint Knight 09|Cease that.
Toussaint Knight 09|The duchy as a whole suffers from a disconnect with reality…
Toussaint Knight 09|Ehh, I think I shall say diddle it all and go herd sheep…
Toussaint Knight 09|I still cannot fathom it - the duquessa, dead…
Toussaint Knight 09|You've cleaned the place nicely. Driven the vampires out, killed the Beast…
Toussaint Knight 09|A great woe this, a great woe…
Toussaint Knight 09|Come! Succumb to death's embrace!
Toussaint Knight 09|Let us end this. You and I!
Toussaint Knight 09|Ehh, what's the point?
Toussaint Knight 09|I've had just about enough of this toil…
Toussaint Knight 09|Go on! No remorse!
Toussaint Knight 09|Whew, that was close! You came to my aid in the nick of time. I thank you, friend.
Toussaint Knight 09|Friend, I thank you once more for saving my bum!
Toussaint Knight 09|Come! Succumb to death's embrace!
Toussaint Knight 09|Let us end this. You and I!

Toussaint Knight 11|Long live the Duchy of Toussaint!
Toussaint Knight 11|Long live the duquessa!
Toussaint Knight 11|Yes? What?
Toussaint Knight 11|May history's wheel roll onward.
Toussaint Knight 11|So fall in lads behind the drum, with colors blazing like the sun, along the road to come-what-may - over the hills and far away!
Toussaint Knight 11|Say, be you Ravix of Fourhorn? On your victory in the tourney I congratulate you.
Toussaint Knight 11|Say, be you Geralt of Rivia? On your victory in the tourney I congratulate you.
Toussaint Knight 11|You call those manners? You call that decent behavior?
Toussaint Knight 11|Hurrah!
Toussaint Knight 11|Dog's dangling grapes!
Toussaint Knight 11|You're fast, demon's spawn!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Knight 12|At thunderous speed with lances they strike, many a knight will not leave with his life. A wild flash fills one man's eyes, through another's veins hot blood flies…
Toussaint Knight 12|A third cries out for a mercy blow, wanting death's peace to know… And those who were in fresh graves thrown, slowly march to lands unknown…
Toussaint Knight 12|Now that you've killed the Beast, will you not be bored here, witcher?
Toussaint Knight 12|My regards to the tourney's victor.
Toussaint Knight 12|Control yourself, hound, or I shall tighten your lead!
Toussaint Knight 12|Come here! I'll cleave your pate!
Toussaint Knight 12|Death!
Toussaint Knight 12|Whoa-ho, it seems we're in for trouble!
Toussaint Knight 12|Sir witcher!
Toussaint Knight 12|Hey! I spoke to you, sir!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Knight 13|A knight is one who does not what he wishes, but what he should do.
Toussaint Knight 13|Should I break one of my rules once, I am bound to break many more.
Toussaint Knight 13|It's time I stepped out into the world and wandered. The duquessa's death marks the end here.
Toussaint Knight 13|Witcher, why did you not take the blow for the duquessa?
Toussaint Knight 13|Taste my cold steel!
Toussaint Knight 13|Defend yourself!
Toussaint Knight 13|You fight well, yet still, you shall perish!
Toussaint Knight 13|Good deeds are always rewarded.
Toussaint Knight 13|Peace and prosperity.
Toussaint Knight 13|That's enough!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Knight 14|Drizzlespit, I've not a copper of my wages left…
Toussaint Knight 14|The camerlengo best not be late with my pay…
Toussaint Knight 14|Sir Ravix, you knew no competition at the tourney!
Toussaint Knight 14|Sir Geralt, you knew no competition at the tourney!
Toussaint Knight 14|Ptooey. There's no point in prolonging this…
Toussaint Knight 14|Let us get this over with.
Toussaint Knight 14|I shall take care of you soon enough!
Toussaint Knight 14|Yes?
Toussaint Knight 14|I'm listening.
Toussaint Knight 14|Why be you so plucky?
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Knight 15|To kill a brave man is an ignoble deed…
Toussaint Knight 15|The time of heroes is dead, witcher. We men are the monsters now.
Toussaint Knight 15|You are the bravest of us. Your name will live forever.
Toussaint Knight 15|Better to avenge Sir Milton than to indulge in mourning.
Toussaint Knight 15|Do you think yourself the first to seek to kill me?
Toussaint Knight 15|I am the Gutter, the Reaper, the Cleaver and the Gouger!
Toussaint Knight 15|The gods shall not let me die on your blade!
Toussaint Knight 15|How might I help you?
Toussaint Knight 15|Witcher.
Toussaint Knight 15|The duchy's time has come to an end. When we buried the duchess, we buried Toussaint.
Toussaint Knight 15|What is this uproar?
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Knight 16|Ehh… This all bodes very ill.
Toussaint Knight 16|Before long, you will have to look to fairy tales to find a witcher or knight…
Toussaint Knight 16|Salut, witcher! Once more - I thank you for the rescue!
Toussaint Knight 16|Remember, witcher - history is wrought by those who can hang heroes.
Toussaint Knight 16|May the gods' will be done.
Toussaint Knight 16|For the duchess! For Toussaint!
Toussaint Knight 16|Look at that!
Toussaint Knight 16|The pleasure is all mine, truly.
Toussaint Knight 16|Greetings, living legend!
Toussaint Knight 16|I thank you for saving my life.
Toussaint Knight 16|Madman!
Toussaint Knight 16|You saved my life… I shall never forget it!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Knight 17|The quill mightier than the sword? Pff… Only if the sword is very short and the quill very sharp.
Toussaint Knight 17|Has anyone ever won a battle with words?
Toussaint Knight 17|Geralt of Rivia, every man in the duchy is your debtor!
Toussaint Knight 17|I cannot believe you managed to disperse Filibert Fourfingers' hanse! Good on you, sir!
Toussaint Knight 17|You find it hard to keep up?
Toussaint Knight 17|When two quarrel, a third should keep out of it!
Toussaint Knight 17|Let us dance, Snow White!
Toussaint Knight 17|Mhm. You've my attention, sir.
Toussaint Knight 17|Oh, yes. Humblest regards.
Toussaint Knight 17|Whoa, cool your boots, hotspur!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Knight 18|Cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood.
Toussaint Knight 18|My sword marks my path.
Toussaint Knight 18|You endangered your own flesh to defend our duchy from the Beast. Praised be your name!
Toussaint Knight 18|Praised be Geralt, slayer of vampires!
Toussaint Knight 18|Tou-ssaint!
Toussaint Knight 18|Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil!
Toussaint Knight 18|You shall reap what you sow!
Toussaint Knight 18|I follow my destiny.
Toussaint Knight 18|You cannot escape your destiny.
Toussaint Knight 18|I'm watching you, witcher.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Knight 19|Why so pale, witcher? Does our climate not serve you?
Toussaint Knight 19|Do you prefer to go by Geralt of Rivia? Or… the Butcher of Blaviken?
Toussaint Knight 19|How did you fare in there, witcher? Did our prison prove adequately comfortable?
Toussaint Knight 19|A hero, yet he's spent time in the clink.
Toussaint Knight 19|One for all, all for one!
Toussaint Knight 19|Calm, now. It'll be over soon.
Toussaint Knight 19|You're off beat, witcher… very off beat!
Toussaint Knight 19|Your crest - I didn't quite catch what it was.
Toussaint Knight 19|Well, well! Geralt of Rivia.
Toussaint Knight 19|Take one step closer and we shall cross blades!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Knight 20|The duchess and the chivalric code - to them I swore fealty!
Toussaint Knight 20|The friends of my liege, Her Grace the Duchess, are also my lieges.
Toussaint Knight 20|I fear for our future, without our duquessa…
Toussaint Knight 20|Many a knight would long to be your squire, Sir Geralt.
Toussaint Knight 20|For honor and justice!
Toussaint Knight 20|For Her Illustrious Grace, Anna Henrietta!
Toussaint Knight 20|Butter my bum and call it toast!
Toussaint Knight 20|Sir?
Toussaint Knight 20|It is an honor to have you in Toussaint, sir.
Toussaint Knight 20|Sir Geralt!

Toussaint Noble Man 01|Excuse you!
Toussaint Noble Man 01|That's quite the splendid villa the duquessa gave you, Sir Witcher.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|There's a face no ointment could help…
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Work doth one ennoble, sloth doth one gratify.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Toussaint is once more a land of peace and order - thanks largely to your valor.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Consider yourself greeted.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Help me, anyone! He's a madman!
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Welcome.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Save me! Please, sir!
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Lebioda's weeping wounds! They'll devour me! Help!
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Thank you, good sir! You would be the famous witcher, would you not?
Geralt|Exactly.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|I shall hitch my wagon and set off for the monument works at once. They await me there.
Toussaint Noble Man 01|Sacrayblue! The monument's come a long way! All thanks to you, witcher!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Watch it.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|We all trusted you, witcher. You let us down.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|The Butcher of Blaviken called to be the savior of Toussaint? Interesting…
Toussaint Noble Man 02|They say a great deal about you, witcher. And whisper even more.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|You ought to rot in chains, witcher.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Greetings.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Do not force me to summon the guardsmen!
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Leave me in peace, witcher.
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Please, good folk! I've nothing of value! It's but a piece of a monument!
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Save me, sir! Help!
Toussaint Noble Man 02|Saint Lebioda sent you! I must now repair my wagon. They await me at the building site!
Geralt|So long.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Where are your manners?!
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Have you heard? Vermentino and Coronata have partnered up to purchase Belgaard!
Toussaint Noble Man 03|A return to traditional values and morals - that is the remedy for Toussaint's problems. Not two swords.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Est Est flows in the veins of Toussaint!
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Unbelievable… Coronata and Vermentino, reconciled!
Toussaint Noble Man 03|My regards.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Guard… Guard!
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Good to see you.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Good sirs… these are but tools, stone fragments for a monument!
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Show those clever curs their place!
Toussaint Noble Man 03|Sir! Here! Help!
Toussaint Noble Man 03|But why even bother? What did they hope to steal - hammers? A hunk of stone?
Geralt|I see. All right… High time I set off.
Toussaint Noble Man 03|My savior! As you can see, my little misadventure did not delay construction of the monument after all!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Noble Man 31|Never thought I'd live to see times like these.
Toussaint Noble Man 31|I can't believe it. I simply can't.
Toussaint Noble Man 31|Master witcher?
Toussaint Noble Man 31|Yeees?
Toussaint Noble Man 31|Ah yes, good day.
Toussaint Noble Man 31|Well, well, Geralt of Rivia in the flesh.
Toussaint Noble Man 31|Sigh…
Toussaint Noble Man 31|Ah, sorry.
Toussaint Noble Man 31|Watch out!
Toussaint Noble Man 31|Someone help me!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Noble Man 32|Aaaaaah.
Toussaint Noble Man 32|Enough.
Toussaint Noble Man 32|Good sir?
Toussaint Noble Man 32|Please, leave me alone.
Toussaint Noble Man 32|Don't push.
Toussaint Noble Man 32|The sword is un… necessary.
Toussaint Noble Man 32|Desist!
Toussaint Noble Man 32|Do you really wish me to comment?
Toussaint Noble Man 32|Greetings.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Old Man 01|Ooh la la!
Toussaint Old Man 01|They say that to touch such swords as a witcher wears on his back is to lose one's virility! And not even Reginald's jewels can help.
Toussaint Old Man 01|Rumor has it the emperor will turn the duchy over to its folk. After all, the duchess, her sister - all the ruling family are dead.
Toussaint Old Man 01|That young countess, Isabella Marie de Cygne - they say she drags maids down to the old amphitheater to summon ghosts! By stripping them naked and pouring wine on their nips!
Toussaint Old Man 01|Well! You don't say…
Toussaint Old Man 01|Oh, fumbledungs… Is that true?
Toussaint Old Man 01|What have we here?! The tourney's champion!
Toussaint Old Man 01|Here is the hero we can afford! Witcher, open the unbelievers' eyes!
Toussaint Old Man 01|Now I shall sing you a song!
Toussaint Old Man 01|One, two, one, two, three! Five, six, seven, eight!
Toussaint Old Man 01|I liked you from the start! Every witcher I've known has been a swell lad!
Toussaint Old Man 01|Greetings! And welcome!
Toussaint Old Man 01|Why… it's… Help!
Toussaint Old Man 01|Crying crayfish! Is that ever a cloudy frown!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Old Man 02|Whoa there, wobbly walker!
Toussaint Old Man 02|The duchess means for that witcher to settle here permanently. She gave him a vineyard for that very reason. Now that we've him to protect us, all those erring knights - woosh! - can retire early!
Toussaint Old Man 02|Some pervert yanked off Reginald's hallowed stones. They say the deviant runs about the docks, scaring old women with his stony privates!
Toussaint Old Man 02|During the vampire attack, the Belles stuffed garlic into every nook and cranny. Now the clients want discounts for the "disturbing aroma"!
Toussaint Old Man 02|Why, you! Achoo! Dallgummy, boogered myself something horrible.
Toussaint Old Man 02|You spout poppycock. That's the long and the short of it.
Toussaint Old Man 02|Me, I didn't see a single vampire…
Toussaint Old Man 02|Sheep shenanigans! I can't see a thing through these cataracts!
Toussaint Old Man 02|But a few drops of wine, and lo and behold - I see better!
Toussaint Old Man 02|Is that you? The tourney's champion?
Toussaint Old Man 02|Hi-diddily-ho!
Toussaint Old Man 02|Don't hurt me, please!
Toussaint Old Man 02|Sonny, is that you?
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Old Man 03|Make like a ball of yarn and unravel!
Toussaint Old Man 03|In my day, were those ever tourneys…! Once a knight's horse croaked on him. But he didn't back out, no, sir! He hired an ass from a peasant and, I kid you not, rode that ass to victory!
Toussaint Old Man 03|They say that witcher drove the vandaguild from Mont Crane! He killed Filibert Fourfingers, too, though before the bully croaked - chop! He made him Filibert Nofingers!
Toussaint Old Man 03|Now Her Gracious Highness has ordered all the hills planted with garlic instead of vines. And every house in town must hang at least three bushels from its windows. To scare off the blood guzzlers!
Toussaint Old Man 03|But that is complete and utter claptrap!
Toussaint Old Man 03|Bah! The nonsense that comes out of your mouth…
Toussaint Old Man 03|Do you think the duquessa's death will change anything? Hardly!
Toussaint Old Man 03|Sure, go on, drink up while you're young, coin in hand…
Toussaint Old Man 03|Who would've thought? Knights trading in wine, while some witcher guards the common folk…
Toussaint Old Man 03|Honestly? It's a shame you killed the Beast. Now we shall abandon all morality whatsoever!
Toussaint Old Man 03|Your health - may you keep it ever more!
Toussaint Old Man 03|Crikey! Help!
Toussaint Old Man 03|Aaah, the whole place is rubbed, botched and wanked…
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Old Woman 01|Dump it out your rump and fart to finish!
Toussaint Old Woman 01|Have you heard about Sir Maximus Macrinus? Fourfingers' hanse murdered his whole family! Then crucified him on the gates of his vineyard!
Toussaint Old Woman 01|So the witcher came to Monsieur de Bourbeau and said, "I've good news and bad news. The good news is I killed the monster that dwelt beneath your vineyard. The bad news is…"
Toussaint Old Woman 01|"…Your wife was diddling a farmhand!"
Toussaint Old Woman 01|That witcher from the North - he's here for good! The duchess gave him a vineyard for his service to the duchy!
Toussaint Old Woman 01|Truly? I find that hard to believe…
Toussaint Old Woman 01|What's that to do with me?
Toussaint Old Woman 01|Geralt of Rivia, our hero!
Toussaint Old Woman 01|I've this burning, stabbing sensation in my ribs…
Toussaint Old Woman 01|So that is who Her Grace summoned from the North…
Toussaint Old Woman 01|Witcher! You freed us from the Beast - perhaps you might free me from my old ball and chain?
Toussaint Old Woman 01|Lebioda shower you with warmth!
Toussaint Old Woman 01|What's got you so excited?
Toussaint Old Woman 01|Ow, that hurts! What is it?
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Old Woman 02|A dog jostled your mum!
Toussaint Old Woman 02|There's this hairdresser - a real artiste, you know. Well he gave up his position at court, saying "Sod it all," and now shears sheep in some meadow!
Toussaint Old Woman 02|They say that witcher from the North is a deviant. Apparently, he enjoys posing for paintings, his willy dangling out!
Toussaint Old Woman 02|They had miracle over at the Ardaiso quarry. Beef plummeting from the heavens! The workers have hung up their pickaxes and taken to grilling steak instead!
Toussaint Old Woman 02|I don't give a wet slit tickle.
Toussaint Old Woman 02|Oh, I'm not sure about that. Perhaps it's true, perhaps it's not.
Toussaint Old Woman 02|That's a hero! Comely, valiant, voluptuous!
Toussaint Old Woman 02|Our duquessa's a lovely lass, ehh, you scamp, you?
Toussaint Old Woman 02|Heheh. It matters not that a man's fit as a fiddle if he never gives his lady a roaring diddle! Hahaha!
Toussaint Old Woman 02|I wager you must beat the maidens back with a long stick, eh, tourney champion?
Toussaint Old Woman 02|May fortune shower down upon you!
Toussaint Old Woman 02|Oh, you hound hugger!
Toussaint Old Woman 02|Why, you cheeky rake! Hahaha!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Old Woman 03|May every door slam on your nose!
Toussaint Old Woman 03|That witcher? It's not the first time he's here. His friend, that crooner who came with him before, was in veeeeery close comity with our duquessa…
Toussaint Old Woman 03|The ground took to shaking under the Tufo vineyard! No folk were willing to work there!
Toussaint Old Woman 03|Those fools who chummed with de Savarin and wore dresses to muck about in the dirt - they were all eaten by some ancient monsters! Not a one survived!
Toussaint Old Woman 03|Ah, yes! I heard that somewhere as well!
Toussaint Old Woman 03|Who spreads such utter tripe?
Toussaint Old Woman 03|Lebioda's wounds, our duchess, Her Illustrious Highness… dead…
Toussaint Old Woman 03|When I was a young maid, we adhered to certain morals. As one should!
Toussaint Old Woman 03|Our knights challenge each other for sport, leave us to summon a witcher from the North for help… Who would have thought it possible?
Toussaint Old Woman 03|With the duquessa gone… our morals are sure to plummet.
Toussaint Old Woman 03|Ah. Greetings. To you. Greetings.
Toussaint Old Woman 03|Goodness gracious, what now?!
Toussaint Old Woman 03|Leave me be, give me peace.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Peasant Man 01|Sir… be careful, will you?
Toussaint Peasant Man 01|Bah! The claptrap you repeat after others…
Toussaint Peasant Man 01|Oh, yes! They said the same at the auberge!
Toussaint Peasant Man 01|The duchy's small, but do you know any who's not heard of our wines?
Toussaint Peasant Man 01|*Sniffs* You smell that? Those are the vapors of Toussaint!
Toussaint Peasant Man 01|Gray, yes, scraggly, yes, but at the tourney - he knew no equal…
Toussaint Peasant Man 01|Well, witcher, without you, Toussaint would be in a sorry state. Oh, sorry indeed!
Toussaint Peasant Man 01|But how?! And why?!
Toussaint Peasant Man 01|Up Lynx Crag, there's this witch who steals little ones, grinds their bones to flour and bakes gingerbread biscuits out of it!
Toussaint Peasant Man 01|I hear they've still not cleaned all the blood off the city streets after the vampire attack… It flowed down the gutters in torrents!
Toussaint Peasant Man 01|When the Beast came for Sir de Peyrac-Peyran, the knight dropped his sword and tried to run, but with all that armor, he didn't get far…
Toussaint Peasant Man 01|Good day!
Toussaint Peasant Man 01|So? How do you like it here?
Toussaint Peasant Man 01|Oh, I hate those Vermentino worms…
Toussaint Peasant Man 01|To reconcile, that's one thing, but to start making wine together? It boggles the mind!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Peasant Man 02|Tsk, tsk, tsk!
Toussaint Peasant Man 02|What a tale…
Toussaint Peasant Man 02|Hah! Sounds like pure chicken spittle!
Toussaint Peasant Man 02|And what do you get for all that work? A crook in your back once you're on in years…
Toussaint Peasant Man 02|The days pass, the pile of work remains the same…
Toussaint Peasant Man 02|The Beast was - the Beast is no more.
Toussaint Peasant Man 02|But for one sister to do that to another…?
Toussaint Peasant Man 02|Help! Help me!
Toussaint Peasant Man 02|They say the miller's son ran off to join Starling Straggen's hanse. And remember what a good lad he was?
Toussaint Peasant Man 02|When the witcher caught Loth Halfbreed - you know, the guttersnipe who botched Fox Hollow - he tore him apart, bare-handed!
Toussaint Peasant Man 02|That spriggan that slaughtered the Cutterins - apparently it was forced to do it. Foul magic worked by the daughter's suitor. All on account of him being refused her hand!
Toussaint Peasant Man 02|Good day, good day…
Toussaint Peasant Man 02|Yeaaaah?
Toussaint Peasant Man 02|Cat-piddled Coronata…
Toussaint Peasant Man 02|Just yesterday they were fighting like cats, and today? They're in business together!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Peasant Man 03|Watch where you traipse!
Toussaint Peasant Man 03|A bunch of an old wife's runny refuse!
Toussaint Peasant Man 03|It cannot be!
Toussaint Peasant Man 03|Even a horse drops if you ride it at a constant gallop…
Toussaint Peasant Man 03|A bushel of grapes is more a burden than that steel of yours…
Toussaint Peasant Man 03|You tallywacked the Beast? Huh, not bad…
Toussaint Peasant Man 03|There's no point weeping after the duchess. We ought to put our noses to the grindstone.
Toussaint Peasant Man 03|Good folk! Help!
Toussaint Peasant Man 03|They say that witcher from the North's a hardened killer! He's lopped off the head of many a king!
Toussaint Peasant Man 03|That vineyard the witcher got? Word is the Ducal Guard had been storing stiffs there!
Toussaint Peasant Man 03|Folk say the duquessa's sister was cursed! Branded by the Black Sun!
Toussaint Peasant Man 03|Hullo.
Toussaint Peasant Man 03|Yes'm?
Toussaint Peasant Man 03|Liam and Matilda running a vineyard together… hah!
Toussaint Peasant Man 03|Those Vermentino folk - even their own children cringe at any mention of them!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Peasant Man 04|Whoa, sir! Watch it!
Toussaint Peasant Man 04|What's this?! You don't say!
Toussaint Peasant Man 04|I've this strange inkling that's a load of hooey.
Toussaint Peasant Man 04|A man who dare not down some red is a man who's wife's like to thump his head!
Toussaint Peasant Man 04|If my lips don't stink of wine, my wife won't know they're mine!
Toussaint Peasant Man 04|A whish, and a whack! And that was all she wrote for the Beast.
Toussaint Peasant Man 04|Vampeers attacked the city?! Is that true?!
Toussaint Peasant Man 04|Leave me be! Please!
Toussaint Peasant Man 04|In seeking out the witcher, our knights rode as far as the land they call Velen. Such famine rages there! Why, they bake bread out of acorns and have never so much as heard of wine!
Toussaint Peasant Man 04|At the Casteldaccia vineyard there's a wraith so frightening, no man dares go near! One look from the creature and the blood in your veins is like to freeze!
Toussaint Peasant Man 04|That shaking at the Tufo vineyard? It was monsters that'd made their lair in the burrows underneath. But the witcher, a true specialist, he smoked them all out!
Toussaint Peasant Man 04|My regards.
Toussaint Peasant Man 04|Hi, there, ho, there!
Toussaint Peasant Man 04|I wish some hanse would cut up those bedwetters at Vermentino!
Toussaint Peasant Man 04|Master Liam and Maid Matilda, why they'll have a tale to hold their kiddies rapt!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Peasant Man 05|Harlotsbrood!
Toussaint Peasant Man 05|Impossible!
Toussaint Peasant Man 05|Oh, yes! I heard the same, myself!
Toussaint Peasant Man 05|A high and mighty Northerner, dog diddled dunglicker…
Toussaint Peasant Man 05|Do what they summoned you to do, then pack up and go back where you came from.
Toussaint Peasant Man 05|The duchess died! For your sins!
Toussaint Peasant Man 05|Why are you still here?! You mean to foul up more things?!
Toussaint Peasant Man 05|Everyone! Murderers!
Toussaint Peasant Man 05|More weeping and wailing's been heard near Caroberta Woods. No doubt it's the spirits frolicking 'midst the ruins of Termes palace.
Toussaint Peasant Man 05|The witcher and our duchess' sister? Partners in crime - he even helped her do in our dearest duquessa…
Toussaint Peasant Man 05|I heard it was the witcher who sent all those vampires against the city. So he could play hero!
Toussaint Peasant Man 05|Hullo.
Toussaint Peasant Man 05|You cat-licked doo-doo diddler.
Toussaint Peasant Man 05|Coronata, ptooey! Hound's hinies, the lot!
Toussaint Peasant Man 05|May fortune smile upon young Liam and Matilda.
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Peasant Woman 01|Oh, you bleeding bumbotcher!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 01|Just plum lovely! What a tale!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 01|Sheesh, there's no chance that's true.
Toussaint Peasant Woman 01|A witcher - we could use one around here! Full-time!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 01|I've a daughter, you know… She's fit to wed, oh so fit…
Toussaint Peasant Woman 01|You've a house. Might it perhaps be time to find a wife?
Toussaint Peasant Woman 01|Geralt! Come here, let me give you a kiss, you dashing young thing!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 01|What the bluthers has got in your head?!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 01|They say the duchess commanded a pair of shaelmaars captured for the tourney. Then, during transport, one fled, dug down deep and got away!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 01|Folk claim the witcher has a mind to cull all the hanses. After all, if he did one in, he'll do in the others, no problem!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 01|The witcher cut down all the prowlers! That's what folk say! Fourfingers, Starling Straggen, Loth Halfbreed - the whole lot!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 01|Good health to you.
Toussaint Peasant Woman 01|Greetings!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 01|Those Vermentino rats've got reesty diddlesacks! Among other things!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 01|You know, Master Liam, Maid Matilda… something tells me it's not just a new vintage they'll be putting out soon…
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Peasant Woman 02|Hey there, halfwit!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 02|Why, that's the rottiest rot I've ever heard!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 02|When I tell my man, he'll be utterly beside himself…
Toussaint Peasant Woman 02|Go up to any knight and shout, "The Beast!" You'll smell the soiled armor at once!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 02|Our knights errant - they're so heroic we had to summon a witcher to do their work!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 02|To think you chased off Filibert Fourfingers' hanse… You've earned my regard, sir!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 02|You sure showed our lumpheads how to maintain order!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 02|Help! Somebody!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 02|Rumor has it the duquessa summoned the witcher for more than the Beast. He's to tend to the hanses. She's given him a vineyard - a down payment of sorts!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 02|Did you hear about the monster that attacked the Cutterin estate? They say it slaughtered them all!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 02|The witcher cleared Fox Hollow so thorough, they say the duchess offered him steady coin to protect her subjects!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 02|Greetings! Greetings!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 02|Don't pester me!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 02|May a river of loose stool run through Coronata!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 02|Long live Liam and Matilda!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Peasant Woman 03|Blind, are you?!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 03|Sweet saintly Lebioda! I can't believe it!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 03|Oooooh, weeeeeell, I don't know.
Toussaint Peasant Woman 03|I've scissored my fingers near to shreds…
Toussaint Peasant Woman 03|If they would just take to work as they take to dance and drink…
Toussaint Peasant Woman 03|Hold on, hold on… was it not you who freed the town from the blood gulpers?
Toussaint Peasant Woman 03|To this day, I still cannot believe it… Blood garglers! At Beauclair's throat!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 03|What… what… what are you doing?
Toussaint Peasant Woman 03|They say the witcher's a mate of the famed bard Dandelion. And that minstrel and our duchess once… you know! Wink, wink!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 03|Folk claim there're such a racket in the cemetery at night that no one gets a wink of sleep. Nor do they know what's making all the noise!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 03|With the duquessa dead, that Nilfgaardian emperor's our liege! They say he aims to move into the palace!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 03|Greetings.
Toussaint Peasant Woman 03|I don't get paid to chit-chat!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 03|Foes yesterday, partners today, and tomorrow? Lovebirds tomorrow! Long live Matilda and master Liam!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 03|May all those wenches at Coronata birth their babes the bumway!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Peasant Woman 04|Hey! Watch it!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 04|It defies belief…
Toussaint Peasant Woman 04|Eh, I've no time for gossip!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 04|Every day the same - wine, wine and more crackswaddling wine. It's enough to drive you batty.
Toussaint Peasant Woman 04|Diddlysnaps… my back aches something horrid…
Toussaint Peasant Woman 04|You freed us from the Beast. Perhaps you could free me from my lumbago?
Toussaint Peasant Woman 04|Our duchess… Leaping Lebioda! How did it ever happen?!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 04|Don't hurt me… Please!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 04|I hear there's a farm by the lake whose sheep-shearer was once hairdresser to the duchess!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 04|They say some daffy city girls try to summon ghosts in the old amphitheater!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 04|The word is the witcher commanded the Guard to chomp on garlic. So as to gain strength to fight the vampeers. The guardsman ate through the Pheasantry's whole supply!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 04|Good day!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 04|Does life suit you here, witcher?
Toussaint Peasant Woman 04|Oh, I hate them, I truly do… those maggots from Vermentino.
Toussaint Peasant Woman 04|Vermentino this, Coronata that… Peace at last!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Peasant Woman 05|Beh, the worst sort of danglestones!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 05|I've heard that, too!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 05|My stomach growls like an angry wolf.
Toussaint Peasant Woman 05|Wine is better than stew, for stew you have to chew.
Toussaint Peasant Woman 05|Duchess Anna Henrietta's soul find rest…
Toussaint Peasant Woman 05|Oh, you gave those bumdiddlers a good reason to diddle their bums! You freed us of the hanses! I thank you!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 05|The innkeep's boy got so soused the other day, he tried to stick an egg back up a hen's hiney!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 05|An old friend saved the witcher from the noose. Some Julian fellow, who once courted the duchess herself!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 05|They hammer away again at the quarry! The witcher from the North's lifted the curse! The lads can go back to their labors.
Toussaint Peasant Woman 05|Tarry in good health.
Toussaint Peasant Woman 05|Ohh, life.
Toussaint Peasant Woman 05|Those Coronata folk are worse than… than the clap, cholera, plague and leprosy! Combined!
Toussaint Peasant Woman 05|Master Liam and Maid Matilda - I've a feeling they're the apples of each other's eyes.

Toussaint Poor Man 01|Witcher! Save us from the Beast!
Toussaint Poor Man 01|Akh akh… Blazes, my cough's back.
Toussaint Poor Man 01|Did you see them?! The vampeers?!
Toussaint Poor Man 01|Nightmare upon nightmare! First the vampeer attack, now the duquessa's death…
Toussaint Poor Man 01|No! No… akh akh! Please!
Toussaint Poor Man 01|Ehh, what goes on in that head of yours?
Toussaint Poor Man 01|Gee-golly, akh akh! Golly-gee!
Toussaint Poor Man 01|That witcher got heaps of gold for killing the Beast. So much he could buy Castel Ravello! Akh akh!
Toussaint Poor Man 01|The witcher got rid of the Beast, but the duquessa balked at paying him. She got a severe tongue-lashing! In front all her ministers! That's why the witcher landed in prison!
Toussaint Poor Man 01|Greetings!
Toussaint Poor Man 01|Don't you tread on me!
Toussaint Poor Man 01|Well, what do you want?
Toussaint Poor Man 01|Instead of hunting the Beast, that witcher's been at the tourney. Bashing shields with the knights. I suppose he forgot he's here to save us?!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Poor Man 02|Instead of hunting the Beast, the witcher hunted for Reginald's missing jewels! But to give credit where it's due, he did find them.
Toussaint Poor Man 02|I heard a handful of ladies-in-waiting meet at the old amphitheater. They summon ghosts, there! All in the nude!
Toussaint Poor Man 02|That new cognac the Monnart Brothers distill - you can drink all you want and never have a hangover! Not even a teensy-weensy one, they say!
Toussaint Poor Man 02|Guard! Save me! Guard!
Toussaint Poor Man 02|That one has it good… A vineyard from the duchess, for doing jack-diddly…
Toussaint Poor Man 02|Better to die of drink than of boredom.
Toussaint Poor Man 02|You'll not find work here. Not paying work, that is.
Toussaint Poor Man 02|I, too, sat out a spell in the clink. No shame in it, witcher!
Toussaint Poor Man 02|What the hey-diddle-diddle do I care…?
Toussaint Poor Man 02|How about that…
Toussaint Poor Man 02|My deepest regards.
Toussaint Poor Man 02|How goes it, friend?
Toussaint Poor Man 02|Why? Really, why?
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Poor Man 03|Remember me? I lent you coin for wine!
Toussaint Poor Man 03|Lebioda… Were only my spirit as willing as my flesh is weak…
Toussaint Poor Man 03|Oooh! Our hero!
Toussaint Poor Man 03|They might just build a statue in your honor. As they did in Reginald's!
Toussaint Poor Man 03|That's right! Maim! Kill!
Toussaint Poor Man 03|Hoedily-heidily!
Toussaint Poor Man 03|Give us a fiver!
Toussaint Poor Man 03|Apologize, holediddler!
Toussaint Poor Man 03|When those vampeers were running about town, I almost dumped my guts in fear!

Toussaint Trader 02|Salutations.
Toussaint Trader 02|In need of advice?
Toussaint Trader 02|Have I gone absolutely cuckoo? Selling all, dirt cheap?!
Toussaint Trader 02|A shaelmaar, crikey… I just hope another doesn't crop up.
Toussaint Trader 02|Good folk, have you seen these prices? I must have drunk a crazy potion!
Toussaint Trader 02|It's nothing, really.
Toussaint Trader 02|Help! I'm under attack!

Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|Top of the tops to you!
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|Can I do something for you?
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|Smell that? Welcome to Toussaint!
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|From buds to bottles - a marvelous process!
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|Good sir! Help! Vileness in the fields! They're infested!
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|Whoaaaa…
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|Witcher… Calmer.
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|Master, help! Monsters! There!
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|Beware of the Vermentino folk. They're a vicious lot!
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|Witcher, you must give the Coronata crew a wide berth! Vipers, to a man!
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|None expected that finale! To reconcile Vermentino and Coronata…? Thank you, witcher!
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 01|I thank you for the rescue! You're one fine fellow, witcher!
<|endoftext|>
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 02|Greetings.
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 02|Forgive me, I'm occupied.
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 02|Why must you push?!
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 02|Up to our necks in work, yet they had to drink themselves sick!
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 02|Layabouts, wonks, sluggards, skivers…
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 02|What? Come to spy for Coronata?
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 02|Calm yourself!
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 02|To me, witcher, you've the stench of a Vermentino spy about you.
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 02|You! Hey! With the blades on your back! Help us! Look! Monsters all about!
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 02|You! You've the look of a knight! Over there! Monsters have come!
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 02|We… I… Thank you.

Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 03|I've not seen a bumper crop like this in ages…
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 03|What a bountiful season! We must order more barrels!
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 03|Greetings!
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 03|Welcome!
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 03|Hey! Try to be more careful!
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 03|I would share some choice words about Vermentino, but I would rather not burn my tongue.
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 03|Such jests are not appreciated!
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 03|When I think of those Coronata swindlers, I can barely choke back the bile!
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 03|You're a witcher, right? Help us, you must! Monsters in the field ahead!
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 03|Lebioda's wounds! Witcher! Monsters, there!
Toussaint Vineyard Supervisor 03|Thanks! I thank you!

Toussaint Worker 01|Whoa, whoa! Calm now!
Toussaint Worker 01|Work's hard on the nerves, eh? It's why you're so gray.
Toussaint Worker 01|A job is like a lady. You can always get a new one.
Toussaint Worker 01|Our brave guardsmen took on the vampires, defended the town with their own breasts! And bellies!
Toussaint Worker 01|Well, Graylocks! You sure tucked away that Beast affair!
Toussaint Worker 01|Hey, mate!
Toussaint Worker 01|How's it!
Toussaint Worker 01|What's new, handsome knight?
Toussaint Worker 01|Sir! Help, please! I'm hauling stone for the statue, but -- monsters!!
Toussaint Worker 01|Witcher! Save us! And the wagon!
Toussaint Worker 01|Thank you, sir witcher! Lebioda keep you in his care!
Toussaint Worker 01|We'll be up and rolling again in no time! They're waiting on us!

Toussaint Worker 05|Calm down or you'll taste the back of my hand!
Toussaint Worker 05|Rosie, you're all right - you wear my ring. When you hold me tight - Rosie, that's my thing…
Toussaint Worker 05|Come evening, I'm off to the Belles, quick as a flash! Those girls can't wait to see me…
Toussaint Worker 05|With the Beast beat down, the Belles should be particularly eager to please!
Toussaint Worker 05|Hey! Tourney champion! The Belles must give you one hefty reduction!
Toussaint Worker 05|You call that walking?
Toussaint Worker 05|Hey! Welcome!
Toussaint Worker 05|What's up, kitty eyes?
Toussaint Worker 05|Lebioda's wounds! Save us! Kitty eyes!
Toussaint Worker 05|Help! Help! Nastinesses! Filth!

Verden Old Man 01|So they took his son and… Poor man had to watch!
Verden Old Man 01|Melitele, keep us…
Verden Old Man 01|Wanna try some goosefoot? Supposed to taste like beans.
Verden Old Man 01|I don't know.
Verden Old Man 01|Welcome.
Verden Old Man 01|Argh.
Verden Old Man 01|Don't hit me, sir.
Verden Old Man 01|Not one o' the baron's men, are you?
Verden Old Man 01|Sir!
Verden Old Man 01|Mercy! Don't hurt me, I beg ye!
Verden Old Man 01|Nooo!
Verden Old Man 01|We look to ye for protection, Hallowed Melitele.
Verden Old Man 01|Would ye fetch brushwood with me the morrow?
Verden Old Man 01|Never you worry, they'll get what's comin' to 'em!
Verden Old Man 01|Remember Vserad? Wanted to squeeze the common folk by starvin' 'em?
Verden Old Man 01|Brought a curse down upon hisself, he did, rats ate 'im alive…
Verden Old Man 01|Can't believe it, can't believe what I'm hearin'.
Verden Old Man 01|I didn't do nothin'!
Verden Old Man 01|Ruffians to a man, looters, whoresons all…
<|endoftext|>
Verden Old Man 02|Puffboes've brought us rain!
Verden Old Man 02|Poor lad broke down after that. Probably find him hangin' from a branch in the woods soon.
Verden Old Man 02|Enough, don't wanna hear this.
Verden Old Man 02|And? Will ye leave 'im in the forest?
Verden Old Man 02|Let it go. 'Tis the hunger… makes me head spin.
Verden Old Man 02|Be well!
Verden Old Man 02|Tisn't easy, not at all…
Verden Old Man 02|On your way.
Verden Old Man 02|If it weren't for our fair helpers rulin' the wilds we'd have starved long past!
Verden Old Man 02|Uh. What were that about?
Verden Old Man 02|Hide, good folk! Hide!
Verden Old Man 02|Help!
Verden Old Man 02|Merciful Verna, mum of the needful, have mercy on us!
Verden Old Man 02|Think this'll keep us safe from the bandits' wrath?
Verden Old Man 02|Leave me be.
Verden Old Man 02|So you're that White One…
<|endoftext|>
Verden Old Man 03|Perchance the vermin'll stay in the castle with it pourin' like this…?
Verden Old Man 03|Bloody Baron's called what he is 'cause he's a beastly madman. Gurgles demon blood every morn!
Verden Old Man 03|A pox on us all if it's true!
Verden Old Man 03|A vampeer's killed another wench?
Verden Old Man 03|Akh akh akh…
Verden Old Man 03|Gods watch o'er ye!
Verden Old Man 03|Your young'uns - they healthy?

Verden Old Man 03|Master witcher! There's an elven burial ground in the caverns nearabouts Midcopse.
Verden Old Man 03|And a heap o' monsters roamin' about it!
Verden Old Man 03|Am I ploughin' invisible?

Verden Old Woman 01|Her throat torn open! But nary a drop of blood!
Verden Old Woman 01|Dear Melitele, so it's true.
Verden Old Woman 01|Join me to pray come evenin'?
Verden Old Woman 01|Reckon so, aye.
Verden Old Woman 01|Tis the gods' will.

Verden Old Woman 01|Oof!
Verden Old Woman 01|Please, not this… Not again…
Verden Old Woman 01|Huahh aah aahh…!
Verden Old Woman 01|Hear my prayer, Hallowed Melitele.
Verden Old Woman 01|All evil's the elves' doin'! Pellar said the bloodsucker crawled from an elven grave.
Verden Old Woman 01|Heard 'bout that too!
Verden Old Woman 01|Misfortune never sleeps in the forest.
Verden Old Woman 01|Hunger's turned this one pale.
<|endoftext|>
Verden Old Woman 02|Told 'im to patch the roof. House'll be full o' puddles again.
Verden Old Woman 02|Our men were riled, wanted to chase 'em off. Sadly, that lot outnumbered 'em.
Verden Old Woman 02|They bound 'em, dragged 'em to the barn… And… Haven't the strength to talk about it…
Verden Old Woman 02|Have the gods abandoned us?
Verden Old Woman 02|So? Will you brew the burdock soup? I'd be afeard o' poisonin' meself!
Verden Old Woman 02|What's that now?
Verden Old Woman 02|Good mornin'.
Verden Old Woman 02|Greetin's.
Verden Old Woman 02|Yeah?
Verden Old Woman 02|Who will protect us poor from the cutthroats? Who, I ask?
Verden Old Woman 02|Why you pushin'?
Verden Old Woman 02|I beg ye, put the sword away.
Verden Old Woman 02|Melitele save us!
Verden Old Woman 02|Answer my prayer.
Verden Old Woman 02|Her husband on the mend? D'you know?
Verden Old Woman 02|Leave me be.
Verden Old Woman 02|Wild Hunt take them all!
<|endoftext|>
Verden Old Woman 03|*Sigh* Oh, just perfect.
Verden Old Woman 03|Group o' village boys got together. Anyone haulin' goods 'long the road…
Verden Old Woman 03|They jump 'im, and if he don't give willingly - they take a hammer to his noggin!
Verden Old Woman 03|Devil's shite, that!
Verden Old Woman 03|Ye thought to ask the pellar for help?
Verden Old Woman 03|I don't care anymore.
Verden Old Woman 03|*Violent choking cough*!
Verden Old Woman 03|Greetin's!
Verden Old Woman 03|You a witcher?
Verden Old Woman 03|Witcher, take pity, don't steal our young 'uns!
Verden Old Woman 03|Hey!
Verden Old Woman 03|Run!
Verden Old Woman 03|Somebody help me!
Verden Old Woman 03|{*Sob sob*}

Verden Peasant 01|Dribblin'.
Verden Peasant 01|Fierce man-eater prowls the wood. Big as a house, it is, with huuuuge horns!
Verden Peasant 01|Gossips gossip for gossip's sake.
Verden Peasant 01|Would ye go gather roots with me?
Verden Peasant 01|Can't take it anymore..
Verden Peasant 01|Old man at home?
Verden Peasant 01|Greetings.
Verden Peasant 01|What's new in the broad world?

Verden Peasant 01|Run! Leg it!
Verden Peasant 01|Mercy…
Verden Peasant 01|Merciful Verna!
Verden Peasant 01|Reckon you'll ever have any grain to sell?
Verden Peasant 01|Specter crept in their hut the night, made nary a sound.
Verden Peasant 01|She were with child, but the wraith took no heed…
Verden Peasant 01|Stop pesterin' me!
Verden Peasant 01|Got any vittles? Hungry like a wolf, I am…
Verden Peasant 01|See you're a man well traveled, so tell me…
Verden Peasant 01|Should I beat me wench once a week, or oftener?
Verden Peasant 01|You can try to win 'em all, but you won't.
<|endoftext|>
Verden Peasant 02|Meh.
Verden Peasant 02|Heard no monster'll come near ye if ye stuff all your holes with garlic.
Verden Peasant 02|But where'll ye get garlic these days?
Verden Peasant 02|Don't say no more!
Verden Peasant 02|Scum! You'll not stand for this, will ye?
Verden Peasant 02|Meeeh…
Verden Peasant 02|Greetings.
Verden Peasant 02|Regards.
Verden Peasant 02|I'm busy, busy man.
Verden Peasant 02|And this be the witchman, the freak o' nature?
Verden Peasant 02|Pff, picked more interestin' things from my nose.
Verden Peasant 02|Ouch!
Verden Peasant 02|For gods' sake! Don't kill me!
Verden Peasant 02|People! People!
Verden Peasant 02|Gods bless me…
Verden Peasant 02|Interest ye in a pair o' clogs? Barely used.
Verden Peasant 02|Can't be in two places at once, can I?!
Verden Peasant 02|Won't be as cocky once the baron's men whip your arse.
<|endoftext|>
Verden Peasant 03|Rain don't rust your blades?
Verden Peasant 03|Wild Hunt swooped down on 'em 'cause they didn't respect the Ladies!
Verden Peasant 03|Nothin' left but to pray, beg evil spares us, at least.
Verden Peasant 03|I say we tell the baron's boys he hides his daughter in the forest. Might toss us some grub, then.
Verden Peasant 03|Maybe so. Aaaand maybe no?
Verden Peasant 03|Greetings.
Verden Peasant 03|Not lookin' good, I tell ye.
Verden Peasant 03|What's on your mind?
Verden Peasant 03|Hair white as curd.
Verden Peasant 03|Ah, curd, that would hit the spot.
Verden Peasant 03|Hold on!
Verden Peasant 03|Sweet Mother.
Verden Peasant 03|Murder!
Verden Peasant 03|The young'uns, at least - don't let them go hungry…
Verden Peasant 03|Best give Crow Perch a wide berth.
Verden Peasant 03|Ever eaten tree bark? Me, I got splinters comin' out me arse from it!
<|endoftext|>
Verden Peasant 04|Drats! Just sent granddad out for some dry brushwood!
Verden Peasant 04|Punished 'em with the sword and the pox. Not a soul left alive in the hamlet.
Verden Peasant 04|That the truth?
Verden Peasant 04|They looted them merchants bare? Whaddaya say we join 'em?
Verden Peasant 04|Ah, for cryin' out loud!
Verden Peasant 04|Gods speed your work!
Verden Peasant 04|Hey, well met!
Verden Peasant 04|G'day.
Verden Peasant 04|Witcher, 'tis as though the heavens sent ye!
Verden Peasant 04|Oo! Coppin' a feel?
Verden Peasant 04|Criminy!
Verden Peasant 04|Gods…
Verden Peasant 04|May his blood fall on me, not on me young 'uns.
Verden Peasant 04|Top o' the day.
Verden Peasant 04|Siiiir, why we're up to our noses in frights and horrors! Imps, samovilas, mamunes, flyin' drakes, pikes… oh, and bats!
<|endoftext|>
Verden Peasant 05|Midges were bitin' on account o' this downpour.
Verden Peasant 05|If a man defies a pact solemnized…
Verden Peasant 05|He'll be devoured by a wood snake, a vile dragon, with seven heads and ten horns!
Verden Peasant 05|Not willin' to believe that, naye, I'm not!
Verden Peasant 05|Figure that's true? You convinced?
Verden Peasant 05|But you've already asked me that!
Verden Peasant 05|What now?
Verden Peasant 05|May the grace o' the good woodland Ladies go with ye.
Verden Peasant 05|Huh?
Verden Peasant 05|It matter where the grub's from? Long as the bowl's full.
Verden Peasant 05|Not my fault he ended six feet under the birches. Why'd he have to play the hero?
Verden Peasant 05|Argh. Dumb oaf.
Verden Peasant 05|Hide! All o' yous!
Verden Peasant 05|Please… I'm beggin'!
Verden Peasant 05|Gods! End the hunger, ye've punished us enough…
Verden Peasant 05|We're simple folk. We seek no quarrel.
Verden Peasant 05|Ye seek trouble? Don't. It'll find ye.

Verden Smith 01|Hey!
Verden Smith 01|Don't stir the wolf packs, grayhair.
Verden Smith 01|Good folk!
Verden Smith 01|*Spit* Work an' more work!

Verden Woman 01|Kiddies! Come inside!
Verden Woman 01|They gots a sack of millet from the Ladies.
Verden Woman 01|Cept weren't one but two they left in the woods…
Verden Woman 01|Oh, that's terrible!
Verden Woman 01|Will ye go with me to the shrine?
Verden Woman 01|I dunno.
Verden Woman 01|What's the rush?
Verden Woman 01|I'll utter a prayer for ye.
Verden Woman 01|Roots're gonna rot my gut.
Verden Woman 01|Maybe I should send me man to the creek? Might catch somethin'.
Verden Woman 01|Freak.
Verden Woman 01|People!
Verden Woman 01|Hallowed Melitele!
Verden Woman 01|You are the mercy, you are the solace, you are the joy.
Verden Woman 01|Can't ye finagle some goods from the Black Ones?
Verden Woman 01|Lass is askin' for it! She'll be wailin' once the baron's men lay their hands on her. And then they'll burn the village down!
Verden Woman 01|What if it's tripe? 'Tain't worth botherin' with.
Verden Woman 01|What do you want?
Verden Woman 01|What're ye lookin' at? Stop botherin' us poor folk.
<|endoftext|>
Verden Woman 02|Even the gods weep for our misfortune…
Verden Woman 02|Weren't the baron's men burned the village. 'Twas the Wild Hunt. Wraiths didn't leave a soul alive!
Verden Woman 02|What'll become of us…?
Verden Woman 02|He's bound to come back, isn't he?
Verden Woman 02|Ah, devils take ye.
Verden Woman 02|A good to ye.
Verden Woman 02|*Sneezes* Some malady's tryin' to grip me.
Verden Woman 02|Uhhh…
Verden Woman 02|If only me man weren't forever gettin' tossed at the tavern.
Verden Woman 02|Oh!
Verden Woman 02|You gone daft?!
Verden Woman 02|Don't kill me…
Verden Woman 02|May pox and the shits take any that be hoardin' a hog!
Verden Woman 02|Can any folk afford to buy from ye?
Verden Woman 02|Want to chat? No' with me. My head's a-twirlin' with hunger.
Verden Woman 02|Used to be wagons showed on market days, loaded with all kinds of fat - smoked bacon, lard, red sausage…
Verden Woman 02|Now it's acorn flour and tufts of burdock, and all ye can trade is what little hope's left.
<|endoftext|>
Verden Woman 03|Cloud musta burst.
Verden Woman 03|Aye, but he paid a steep price for them gifts. Left ear's gone.
Verden Woman 03|Right true, me sis said the same.
Verden Woman 03|Sure you still wanna go there? Get shivers just thinkin' on it…
Verden Woman 03|Don't wanna hear that drivel.
Verden Woman 03|How've you been?
Verden Woman 03|We shouldn't… we can't lose hope.
Verden Woman 03|Mhm?
Verden Woman 03|Good Ladies, they say, merciful Ladies. Where's all that faith comin' from?
Verden Woman 03|Hey now!
Verden Woman 03|Aaaaa!
Verden Woman 03|Someone have mercy!
Verden Woman 03|Protect me from evil the day and the night.
Verden Woman 03|Best stay clear o' the swamps!
Verden Woman 03|Know the price for their help? Blood, then nightmares.
<|endoftext|>
Verden Woman 04|Aye, flood's all we need.
Verden Woman 04|Robbed soldiers' corpses, chopped off fingers, he did. Then traded the baubles for vittles at the castle.
Verden Woman 04|For that he was cursed. Grew gaunt, lost all his hair, and now he awaits death.
Verden Woman 04|Folk talk o' that in the next village, too.
Verden Woman 04|What'd he make that stew from? Rats?
Verden Woman 04|Got other matters on me mind just now.
Verden Woman 04|Greetings! Greetings! How fare ye?
Verden Woman 04|You're in good health. Glad to see.
Verden Woman 04|I know you from somewhere?
Verden Woman 04|First the armies passed, then the pox, now the hunger. Grim Reaper must be havin' a lark.
Verden Woman 04|Watch it, you clod!
Verden Woman 04|Hide the young 'uns!
Verden Woman 04|Don't kill me!
Verden Woman 04|May that old hen's teeth rot, so my man won't go near her…
Verden Woman 04|Enough is enough!
Verden Woman 04|You, White One, what's your business? Bloody Baron know you're here?
<|endoftext|>
Verden Woman 05|Proper downpour, this is.
Verden Woman 05|Twas innocent as a bunch o' lilies, but the Bloody Baron…
Verden Woman 05|Bloody Baron, grown blind with rage, tanned the skin off his back!
Verden Woman 05|How'm I to sleep nights with you tellin' me such tales?
Verden Woman 05|What if me man and yours tried their hands at that sort of… craft?
Verden Woman 05|We'll chat about it later.
Verden Woman 05|What's that you want?
Verden Woman 05|Said a hag to a hag, "Now here's a stunt, I'll shove a rake right up your cunt!"
Verden Woman 05|Oy, white nob.
Verden Woman 05|In Downwarren, when a wench takes ill…
Verden Woman 05|…they send 'er to the woods for kindling, where beasts devour 'er.
Verden Woman 05|Watch it, sluggard!
Verden Woman 05|Flee! Quick! Now!
Verden Woman 05|Spare me!
Verden Woman 05|We had naught to eat, so I gave 'im up…
Verden Woman 05|What'd you do, ask a bear to dance?
Verden Woman 05|Got an ill look in your eyes.

Witch Hunter 01|Argh, let it rain!
Witch Hunter 01|Soon as Radovid tends to the Black Ones, they say he'll send us 'cross the river.
Witch Hunter 01|To cure the Temerians of their idolatry.
Witch Hunter 01|Hmm, interestin'.
Witch Hunter 01|His wench cuckold 'im again?! Think we should tell 'im?
Witch Hunter 01|Maybe, maybe not. Maybe go fuck yourself.
Witch Hunter 01|Yaaaawn…
Witch Hunter 01|Another day gone to shit…
Witch Hunter 01|White One?
Witch Hunter 01|So bored I could spew.
Witch Hunter 01|What?!
Witch Hunter 01|Lookin' for a bruisin'?
Witch Hunter 01|Spare me…
Witch Hunter 01|Die, whorelicker!
Witch Hunter 01|I-- will-- kill-- you!
Witch Hunter 01|Get 'im from both sides!
Witch Hunter 01|Doin' it!
Witch Hunter 01|Waaaaaaarlooooooock!
Witch Hunter 01|He killed 'im!
Witch Hunter 01|Yeah, heard the same.
Witch Hunter 01|Made a killin' on that last raid, they did.
Witch Hunter 01|Witch had quite the sum in her piggy bank.
Witch Hunter 01|Leave me be.
Witch Hunter 01|What're you lookin' at?
Witch Hunter 01|Had enough of this job.
Witch Hunter 01|Aaargh!
Witch Hunter 01|Shit yourself outta fear?
Witch Hunter 01|Put it away.
Witch Hunter 01|So it is! Freak wants to die!
<|endoftext|>
Witch Hunter 02|Tsk, tsk. Hard to light a pyre in this weather.
Witch Hunter 02|This last mage kept quiet through three days of strappado.
Witch Hunter 02|But when they put the screws to his joints, he confessed at once!
Witch Hunter 02|Bah.
Witch Hunter 02|They finish that inquiry yet?
Witch Hunter 02|Already asked me that, mate.
Witch Hunter 02|Eternal Blaze guide you.
Witch Hunter 02|The Eternal Flame will burn away our sins.
Witch Hunter 02|Scram, 'fore I lose my patience.
Witch Hunter 02|Devil's spawn. *Spits*
Witch Hunter 02|You!
Witch Hunter 02|I'd advise you not to try my patience.
Witch Hunter 02|Eternal Fire!
Witch Hunter 02|Alive, take 'im alive!
Witch Hunter 02|The Eternal Fire will turn you to ash.
Witch Hunter 02|Spread out!
Witch Hunter 02|Don't let 'im drive you back!
Witch Hunter 02|It's only a witcher!
Witch Hunter 02|Degenerate!
Witch Hunter 02|Witcher.
Witch Hunter 02|We'll deal with the witches, then come for you, don't you worry.
Witch Hunter 02|You'll roast on a pyre!
Witch Hunter 02|Ugh!
Witch Hunter 02|Weapon aside, freak.
Witch Hunter 02|You're dead.
<|endoftext|>
Witch Hunter 03|Mhmmm.
Witch Hunter 03|We got 'em locked in the city like rats in a cage.
Witch Hunter 03|Now where'd you hear that?
Witch Hunter 03|You check that last witch thorough? Every nook and cranny?
Witch Hunter 03|Don't feel like talkin' about that just now.
Witch Hunter 03|All hail the Eternal Fire.
Witch Hunter 03|Got a foolproof method for exorcizin' witches.
Witch Hunter 03|Whaddaya want?
Witch Hunter 03|You can learn a greeeaaat deal…
Witch Hunter 03|When you're grippin' a pair o' pincers or white-hot tongs.
Witch Hunter 03|Fuck.
Witch Hunter 03|Sheathe it, White One, or things'll get hot.
Witch Hunter 03|Mummy!
Witch Hunter 03|Had enough?
Witch Hunter 03|Know who you're fuckin' with?!
Witch Hunter 03|Watch his whirlin'!
Witch Hunter 03|Shit!
Witch Hunter 03|Watch out!
Witch Hunter 03|Aaaah
Witch Hunter 03|You cockeyed cunt!
Witch Hunter 03|C'mon, over here!
Witch Hunter 03|Huh?
Witch Hunter 03|Burned all the easy-to-find witches already. And I could use a quickie.
Witch Hunter 03|Calm down, mutant.
Witch Hunter 03|I warned you, freak. You wouldn't listen…
<|endoftext|>
Witch Hunter 04|Witches've conjured rain again.
Witch Hunter 04|They went to shackle the devil's spawn and he cast a spell…
Witch Hunter 04|Blew himself to fuckin' bits! Blood splattered, a hundred paces around!
Witch Hunter 04|Pff, don't give a shit.
Witch Hunter 04|Ever tear off a witch's nails? You know, one by one?
Witch Hunter 04|I think so.
Witch Hunter 04|Every sinner'll burn in the Eternal Fire.
Witch Hunter 04|Beware, for you know neither the day nor the hour.
Witch Hunter 04|Get outta my sight.
Witch Hunter 04|Beware, freak.
Witch Hunter 04|Don't touch me.
Witch Hunter 04|Ohhh yeeeeah. Make my day.
Witch Hunter 04|Akh akh akh ptooey.
Witch Hunter 04|Dead man! Dead man!
Witch Hunter 04|Let's do this quick, quicker, or maybe painfully.
Witch Hunter 04|I want 'im alive! Alive!
Witch Hunter 04|On it!
Witch Hunter 04|Spells!
Witch Hunter 04|By the Eternal Fire!
Witch Hunter 04|Your every move will be counted. And judged.
Witch Hunter 04|Heathen.
Witch Hunter 04|Go back to hell!
Witch Hunter 04|Eternal Fire!
Witch Hunter 04|Bollocks!
Witch Hunter 04|Sheathe your sword.

Geralt|You and Triss have a good time?
Yennefer|Splendid. We finally got the chance to talk.
Geralt|What about?
Yennefer|Everything but you. Geralt of Rivia's no longer a subject of any interest to either of us.
Geralt|Ever think about the past? About your time with the Hunt?
Yennefer|At times… I'm amazed we survived. Eredin's not usually one to leave witnesses behind.
Geralt|That's just it, he didn't. Lost my memory when I escaped the Hunt.
Yennefer|Ah yes, your famous amnesia…
Geralt|You didn't have it?
Yennefer|For a short time only. Once the emperor's mages got their hands on me, my memory quickly returned.
Geralt|When the Hunt had you… hope they didn't hurt you.
Yennefer|Even if they did, I've no memory of it. The whole time's but a string of phantom images. Blood and fire… a wild chase through different worlds… all shrouded in fog.
Yennefer|Though I do remember you coming for me, trading your life for mine. I hadn't the chance to thank you then.
Geralt|You'd 'ave done the same for me.
Yennefer|I'm touched by your certainty. But you've yet to tell me how you escaped them.
Geralt|Wouldn't mind knowing that myself. There are times I remember rushing forward, Red Riders around me. Next thing I know, I'm in the woods at the foot of Kaer Morhen. That's it.
Geralt|What'd Eredin want from you, exactly?
Yennefer|The same thing he wanted from you. You don't recall?
Geralt|Draw a blank on most of my time with them.
Yennefer|We were bait, Geralt. Both of us. Eredin believed Ciri would come for us sooner or later, and he would capture her.
Yennefer|Fortunately, she didn't fall for it.
Geralt|How'd you go from being the emperor's hostage to being his ally?
Yennefer|One day, the door of my cell opened, and instead of seeing the usual officer, I saw Emhyr.
Yennefer|He promised to release me and grant me free reign of the imperial treasury - provided I did what he asked.
Geralt|He told you about Ciri, and you accepted his offer. Why?
Yennefer|Shared aims make for strange bedfellows.
Yennefer|I knew I had to find Ciri before Eredin did. And if any man had the power and the means to help me, it was the emperor.
Yennefer|Besides, once all's said and done, he is her father.
Geralt|Why didn't you look for me after you'd recovered your memory and your freedom?
Yennefer|I assumed you would recover quickly and find me first.
Geralt|You had mages to help you, I was on my own.
Yennefer|Well, not entirely… Besides, I knew you'd fled the Hunt - Eredin would never have let you go. He'd erased my memory, but you escaped - it was wholly possible he hadn't had the chance with you.
Yennefer|And there were your witcher mutations - I expected they'd stave off any serious injury.
Geralt|Still can't get something out of my mind…
Yennefer|What?
Geralt|Thanks, Yen. See you later.
Geralt|We started talking about the past…
Yennefer|But didn't finish.
Geralt|Yen, can we talk?
Yennefer|Why, so you can ask me if we can remain friends, despite all?
Geralt|No, I-- I mean--
Yennefer|Come, now, Geralt. I know you. Well enough to know exactly what's going on with you and Triss.
Yennefer|Now, I cannot say I'm not tempted to, hm, intervene, but… I believe I'll let it lie this time.
Yennefer|How about that? You came here to fumble your way through an explanation, yet instead of enjoying the show, I went and did your job for you.
Geralt|Seems so.
Yennefer|But now, enough of this maudlin business. We've something to do, remember?
Geralt|So, feel any different after our encounter with the djinn?
Yennefer|Yes. Now I feel… regret.
Geralt|Mean to say that--?
Yennefer|That I regret we didn't try that earlier. Much earlier.
Geralt|Think we would've argued less?
Yennefer|Quite the opposite. But the other moments would have been more intense as well.
Yennefer|Moments like this.
Geralt|Listen… this mark - can you do anything about it?
Yennefer|I can scratch it if it itches, but I fear that's all.
Geralt|I'm not joking, Yen.
Yennefer|Neither am I. These symbols… it's ancient, powerful magic. I've no notion how to remove them.
Geralt|Dammit.
Yennefer|You're still one of the prettiest witchers around in my book. Second only to Lambert.
Yennefer|Geralt?
<|endoftext|>
Yennefer|I see you've not forgotten how to use a sword…
Yennefer|My, my… you've grown sloppy at Triss' side. Simply not as agile as you were before.
Yennefer|I detest it when you walk away without a word.
Yennefer|Perhaps it's strange, but I like watching you work. Especially when you're so good at it.
Yennefer|You're better than you were before. And I thought that impossible…
Yennefer|Next time stand behind me, all right? I'd rather defend you than have to patch you up afterwards.
Yennefer|You should drink more potions. You're simply not as quick as you need to be.
Yennefer|I learned this at Brenna!
Yennefer|Aaagghhh!
Yennefer|That's that!
Yennefer|You crossed the wrong sorceress.
Yennefer|Taste this!
Yennefer|You'd best yield now!
Yennefer|There'll be nothing to pick up when I'm done with you.
Yennefer|Ygghh!
Yennefer|This is no time for stunts.
Yennefer|Stop it.
Yennefer|What's this?
Yennefer|Geralt, look.
Yennefer|Yes?
<|endoftext|>
Geralt|What can you tell me about Novigrad's underworld?
Zoltan Chivay|Got one concept for you. The Big Four - Sigi Reuven, the King of Beggars, Cleaver and Whoreson Junior.
Zoltan Chivay|Whaddaya call a triumvirate, but with four individuals?
Geralt|No idea.
Zoltan Chivay|Well, there are four, and they've carved the city into spheres of influence. Nothing happens without them knowin' about it and approvin' it.
Zoltan Chivay|Rumor is Whoreson recently quarreled with the others, but I know nothin' more.
Geralt|Saw burning pyres when I arrived in Novigrad.
Zoltan Chivay|Yes, Felicia Cori, a sorceress, that was. The crowd came for the other burned that day.
Zoltan Chivay|A doppler, crafty wee bugger who'd spent years masquerading as Chappelle, commander of the Temple Guard.
Zoltan Chivay|Twas Caleb Menge who exposed him, executed him, and promptly took his post.
Geralt|Met that doppler years ago, just after he'd assumed Chappelle's identity and form. Wasn't all that surprised when the Church of the Eternal Fire turned tolerant of freaks, opened up a bit to magic and mages.
Zoltan Chivay|Ah well, that's all changed now. Every mage who came here seekin' refuge is now caught in a trap.
Geralt|You've been in town a while, maybe you can tell me - Radovid and Emhyr, why hasn't either taken the city?
Zoltan Chivay|Excellent question. I believe I can clear the mystery up for you.
Zoltan Chivay|War requires resources, wherewithal. Novigrad's a large port with a powerful fleet and a treasury overflowing with gold. All that makes it a tasty morsel, tempting for both Redania and Nilfgaard.
Geralt|I understand the city's walls are high, its arsenals are full of weapons…
Zoltan Chivay|Then you don't understand much. True, a siege'd be a long and grueling affair, but more importantly, everything that's valuable in Novigrad could disappear faster than a mayfly's dream.
Zoltan Chivay|The Big Four's made it known that should things come to a head, the fleet's flammable. And any assault on the city's sure to touch off riots, during which the Church's coffers could very well be looted bare.
Zoltan Chivay|So, anyone wanting Novigrad's wealth, its ships, has no choice but to deal with its criminal underworld.
Geralt|Novigrad doesn't seem like a safe place anymore. What's keeping you here?
Zoltan Chivay|I was keen on startin' my own enterprise, but nothin' came of it. Nevertheless I took on some debt - got to pay it back now.
Zoltan Chivay|I'd like to blame it on the war or human treachery. But… the truth is I've but me own thick skull to blame.
Zoltan Chivay|Rather not dwell on it, Geralt, if you don't mind.
Geralt|Nice talking to you, Zoltan. See you later.
Geralt|Zoltan?
Zoltan Chivay|Geralt?
<|endoftext|>
Zoltan Chivay|Damn the whoreseons!
Zoltan Chivay|Come to pappy.
Zoltan Chivay|You're lookin' weak!
Zoltan Chivay|Fuck, yes!
Zoltan Chivay|Ho-ho! Oh-ho-ho, I could use a pint!
Zoltan Chivay|I feel for your ma, that she bore you!
Zoltan Chivay|You durnk and addled?
Zoltan Chivay|Geralt.
Zoltan Chivay|Geralt, pal.
